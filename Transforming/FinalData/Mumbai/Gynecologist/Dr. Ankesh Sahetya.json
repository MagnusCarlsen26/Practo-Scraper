Finally, I received the right advice and diagnosis that had I\u2019ve been looking for the longest time. Dr. Ankesh took the time to listen to my concerns, thoroughly explained every aspect of my condition, and treated me with the utmost respect and empathy.\n\nUnlike previous experiences, Dr. Ankesh didn't just brush off my pain as something to tolerate or dismiss it as a consequence of my weight. Instead, he approached my case with genuine care and professionalism. He patiently educated me about my condition and proposed tailored treatment options that truly addressed my needs.\n\nDr. Ankesh's commitment to his patients' well-being is unparalleled. He ensures that his patients are fully informed every step of the way, empowering them to make well-informed decisions about their health.\n\nThanks to Dr. Ankesh, I finally found the gynecologist I've been searching for all these years. His expertise, compassion, and dedication have made a significant difference in my life. I am immensely grateful to have him as my healthcare provider, and I wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone seeking exceptional gynecological care. ",

I have been suffering from an infection for over a year and I had been to some of the most renowned hospitals of Mumbai, however nobody could even do a proper diagnosis of the problem. After suffering for almost 18 months I went to Dr. Ankesh Sahetya, he listened to the problem really well instead of jumping to writing prescriptions and did extra research on his own for my problem. Finally after around 25 days of medication and minimal tests, my infection is down by 90%. There was only one follow up after the first visit, and that was enough. Instead of going to some new doctor multiple times and spending thousands in visitation charges and medications, I would really recommend trusting Dr. Ankesh once and going through his treatment. He is an honest man and wants the best for his patients.",

He checked on me through the night and made sure I had a natural delivery by morning. Doc and his entire staff were deeply disturbed and concerned by what had happened and took sensitive care of me and my entire family especially my mother. I met him about a year ago for conception and it has been a journey led by him with compassion, professionalism, expertise and patience. He works step by step and does not push to put one\u2019s body through extreme measures straightaway. I always felt I was meeting my own brother, the warmth and kindness along with the time he gives to understand the entire background and address all my concerns with explaining exactly what we were doing is remarkable. He went out of his way and organised an HSG for me under anaesthesia, for which I\u2019m very grateful. He\u2019s carrying on and building on his father\u2019s legacy standing out in his profession and making everyone proud. I would more than recommend doc and his staff, trust him blindly, it\u2019s going to be a beautiful experience. ",

My medical consultations have predominantly been confined within the confines of my family. However, when I visited Dr. Ankesh Sahetya today for a gynecological examination, the entire experience proved to be exceptional. His ability to elucidate every detail and address all my queries stood out. His composed demeanor was a constant source of reassurance throughout the entire process. His affable and warm nature, coupled with his willingness to invest considerable time in attentively listening to the patient's concerns and accurately diagnosing the issue, is truly commendable. Dr. Ankesh\u2019s infectious smile and positive outlook significantly alleviate apprehensions. His profound knowledge and adeptness in his field are unquestionable, instilling a strong sense of security. I am unequivocally confident that I am under the care of exceedingly capable hands. My heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Ankesh for his outstanding care and expertise.",

What I appreciated most though was his insistence that \u201cif you\u2019re not happy, it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d That meant a lot to me as a patient because it validated my experiences and reminded me what my priorities should be.

His outreach towards his patients has throughly moved me because I felt at ease with him as my doctor. \nNurse Vrinda was a very motherly figure around the clinic, she was so caring and helpful, whether it's with pre/ post-op care or just talking to you and making you feel better.\nDr.Dilip was my anesthesiologist and he made sure I kept talking and distracting myself till I was put under.\nI will be recommending Dr.Ankesh to any one who needs it as I have never had a better experience with any doctor , as he really cares about his patients and will actually empathize with them as well, which makes him a very personable doctor. As I said earlier, I am glad I chose to go to Dr.Ankesh, my life has become a whole lot better.",

It was my first time with a male gynecologist and meeting him not only resolved my queries but it was the best visit I ever had. He made me feel so comfortable and at ease that I felt like I was talking to a friend. The \"stigma\" about being treated was resolved within the second I walked into his cabin. He takes his time to explain you theory in the most simplest manner and not once did i felt that i was being rushed into the diagnosis. I have been to 3 other gynecologist in the last 3 years and I was always felt that my PCOD is my fault and it was a huge mountain to climb. But Dr Ankesh kept assuring me that this is all treatable and instill confidence in me that he is with me during this process. For the first time I felt like we both were on the same side. His knowledge, expertise, warmth and process for treatment is why you should visit him. I highly recommend him to everyone. Trust me once you meet him, you know that your problem is going to be treated and not just shoved aside. He has always been available to answer my slightest to silliest queries. He's not just a doctor but he's an experience which you would want to keep revisiting. ",

As I bled beyond the menopausal deadline, Doctor did an internal examination to discover my endometrial lining was thicker than the healthy marker. He suggested a D&C and hysterectoscopy to rule out abnormalities. The biopsy report came and Doctor called me in to explain my options - wait and watch or get a preventative laparoscopic hysterectomy done.\n\nHe explained to me the pros and cons of both the options. My husband and I decided to take the \u201cprevention is better than cure\u201d course.\n\nDr Ankesh called us in for a Counselling session to explain the entire procedure and answer every one of our questions. We felt safe and secure going through the procedure with him.\n\nFrom pre-operative to post-operative care, Dr Ankesh & his entire team have scaled heights of caring and healing, including his Anaesthetologist who kept a check on my blood glucose levels till discharge.\n\nI feel blessed to be treated by the best. \n\nDespite my kind of nervous disposition caused by 31 years of type 1 diabetes, I actually felt relaxed and confident that I will emerge healed from this procedure. \n\nAnd, yes Dr. Ankesh you are not just a Doctor who treats and cures, but also a healer who understands and you brought me back strong and smiling.",

Ironically, the chosen one happened to be myself. All of a sudden late evening, I started having severe cramps in my pelvic region with severe pain radiating to my back. The first thing which came to my mind was either it is an ovarian cyst or a kidney stone as I happened to be diagnosed with them sometime back but was in clear till now. Tried connecting with all the doctors known to me but somehow did not get the revert and did not know how to go about as the agony was unbearable. Tried self-medicating as had previously too had incidents similar to these but it just seemed to worsen. And, then, I recollected my best friends doctor and thought of contacting him. He was like a Messiah, a saviour. A prompt reply, prescription and also papers so that we could go for diagnosis and not only that he ensured that he spoke to the sonologist. After confirmation, that an ovarian cyst had burst, he asked us to come to the clinic so that he could explain the line of treatment.\nI, really appreciate that at the time when everyone's safety is at stake, he was true to his profession, met us, guided and explained and was ever so courteous to even ask us to inform him the very next day about my well-being.\nVery rarely one comes across someone who takes his \"Hippocrates oath\" so seriously. Gratitude always. Satwinder Nair ",

This was my first visit to a gynaecologist ever. I was noticeably apprehensive and shy about the visit. Catching on to this fear, Dr. Ankesh made me comfortable with the entire consultation. He took a thorough interest in learning about my lifestyle and habits and more importantly what made that consultation necessary for me. Throughout the consultation, our interaction was without fear of judgment which, in my opinion, is very important. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism a year back. When informed about the diagnosis, Dr. Ankesh asked questions related to the symptoms that led to the diagnosis, the medical reports and the treatment thereafter which left no stone unturned in terms of knowing previous medical history. At the end of this briefing, Dr. Ankesh frankly and openly said that he was unwilling to order tests and medicines that are unwarranted which was much to my surprise because I was expecting a long list of blood tests and examinations. \n\nTwo major practises of Dr. Ankesh that makes me want to follow his advice to the letter are: (1) Dr. Ankesh explains the cause/problem without using any heavy medical jargon or words that may cause some anxiety or stress. He uses plastic organ models and drawings in his explanation and how the course of action recommended by him would address the problem. (2) The lifestyle modifications recommended by him are doable and gradual and does not give an impression of a \u2018do or die\u2019 situation. \n\nDr. Ankesh does not hurry through a consultation. He is calm, patient and definitely not a doctor who is just trying to empty his waiting room \ud83d\ude0a\n\n",

I have done one consultation visit and one follow up with him so far. \n\nA little about me: I am 29 years old, married. My presenting concerns were irregular periods, multiple small follicles in the ovaries, acne, some weight gain on and off, hairfall, stress, elevated Insulin and Blood Sugar levels and extremely high Prolactin despite not being pregnant. \n\nHere's why my experience with him was a positive one and why I'd highly recommend him to any of my friends: \n\n1. He built a good rapport with me and made me feel comfortable. \n2. I was given all the information that I needed, to my satisfaction. All my follow up questions were answered patiently and in a way that I would understand better. He performed an ultrasound for me in his clinic itself which gave us the most recent and new information about my uterus- we discovered a few cysts on both ovaries. He also calmly went through a checklist related to PCOS for me and also explained specifically what the severity of my case looks like. I learned that it wasn't as severe as I was assuming. \n3. His prescription was spot on- he prescribed a medicine for reducing the cyst and a supplement for regulating Insulin processing. In just 16-17 days, my Insulin and blood sugar levels reduced (this was also along with an meal plan I was following from a different nutrition expert), I got my period and was able to get further hormone tests done. \n4. The follow up has been good- he checked on all the things he had prescribed earlier to me and also told me what the test results meant and prescribed a medication as needed. \n5. I did not think that I was made to do unnecessary procedures or take unnecessary medication. I worry a lot and therefore I look these things up a lot and I have been satisfied with his process. \n6. His availability- I was given an appointment both times as per my convenience, and he is also easily approachable and responsive on WhatsApp. \n7. The facilities are quite decent and the nurses and he also made me feel physically comfortable in all the procedures that they carried out. \n\nI am very glad my Husband found him when he was looking up good Doctors for PCOS and his search results suggested that Dr Ankesh Sahetya is the best person to go to. I am very happy with my experience and would want to continue consulting him in the future. I wish him the best of health and success in his endeavors!\n",

Moreover, apart from medical counseling he suggested many lifestyle related changes to help in our overall betterment.  I finally found a very good gynaecologist with an in-depth knowledge on his subject who goes into the root of the issue. We would definitely recommend Dr. Ankesh to everyone for any gynaecological concerns. Thank you Dr. Ankesh!!",

I was of the notion that I\u2019ve polycystic ovaries but his scan and the explanation thereof made my misconceptions very clear. \nI would definitely recommend his consultation to females who have myths abt the PCOS/D or anything related to female health.

Highly recommend him, he will make you feel comfortable at once and will patiently listen to all your queries. Also, the staff is very cooperative and helpful, and the surroundings are clean and hygienic which is something that is of utmost importance to me. Anyone who has any kind of gynaec issues, please don\u2019t hesitate to visit him, you won\u2019t be disappointed :) ",

My journey of 09 month pregnancy under supervision of Dr Ankesh was just phenomenal. During our first i was informed to do few test in which it was found that I had very low AMH , hence chances of natural conception was very less. However under Dr Ankesh guidance and supervision this was possible and i conceived naturally in a month. From my 1st scan till my delivery Dr ankesh has been a great support. He was easily available for any of my queries. At each scan he use to explain us the progress of the pregnancy in detail. He is a very positive person and this vibe had helped us successfully complete my 09 months journey.  I am very thankful to him for all his time and efforts. Additionally he has a wonderful team of nurses who have been a great help during my delivery.  The staff and nurses are highly attentive. I highly recommend Dr ankesh for any pregnancy related issue .",

He explained about the test he's going to conduct, what kind of precautions should I be taking and gave me some really helpful advise on vaccination for my cervical health. The support staff is also super jolly and humourous. It was a very relaxing and pleasant experience tbh; didn't feel like I'm in a clinic. So I am totally going to recommend Dr. Ankesh to everyone for their gynaecology or sexual issues :)",

I had never visited a male doctor before and i was reluctant but he made it seem like iv known him for years and i was so comfortable. He remembers his patients, and responds to every query with a smile. It is so rare. I cannot emphasize enough on how important it is to have doctors who are approachable and basically amazing at what they do. I have just started my journey and i am super positive!",

He is super calm, friendly,down to earth and not judgmental and listens,answers and explains everything patiently. My Sonography was done at the clinic itself by him and he explained the findings to me. He also gave me a PCOS diet chart to be followed along with the medication. He is also active on WhatsApp and answers my queries promptly.\n\nI'm so glad I consulted him and look forward for my next visit and would definitely recommend him to others.\n\nSpecial mention to the Sister at the reception, she's sweet and friendly and made me so at ease and calmed my nerves throughout.",

It's great how there is absolute professionalism and a sense of ease in how he handles his patience and makes them comfortable. And the kind of knowledge that he gives is very practical nothing too extraordinary that would go beyond my understanding. Dr. Ankesh's treatment so far has worked well for me.

I looked out for a specialist on Google and Practo, I was amazed by the reviews Dr. Sahetya had and I immediately called him with my issue. He was so prompt in his response. I got a video call from him within 5mins and he knew exactly what that disorder is and the consequences of it. He calmly explained it to me and my husband about it and asked us to go ahead with the test. He is a very knowledgeable doctor. I have consulted doctors in India and they were completely unaware of the condition I was carrying as these reports vare very rare in India. I recommend you to visit him at least once. ",

He has helped me get solutions for all my problems, finally i was just not put on meds but knew the reason what my body is dealing with. I recently had a minor surgery with him the staff was so good at the hospital, very helpful and kind. Overall my experience with pushpaa hospital was amazing. I have even shared his contact to so many people suffering from different reasons. For every patient it is important his/ her doctor listens and dr.Ankesh definitely listens and understands all your problems. A must recommend visit to him if you are facing any problems related to your pcod, endometriosis or personal life problems etc. Thankyou so much team pushpa!! ",

I always opted for a same gender doctor however I couldn\u2019t be more happier to have found Dr.Ankesh. So glad he offers online consultation as well.  I can\u2019t wait to beat PCOS with his positive approach and motivation and my hard work! ",

I visited Dr Ankesh because he had great reviews, abundant services and a promising profile. I've visited more than 4-5 different gynaecologists in last couple years so I wasn't sure what to expect with him. But when I met him, he was great to talk to, respectful, informative and really good at his job. But what I found the most endearing was his ability to sympathise with me and not feel like I am exaggerating my period pain. He pointed out and covered for lacks in data or discovery in my case which should have already been done. We did an ultrasound in the clinic itself which I found very convenient. We discovered a cyst, his correct and timely decisions  for USG allowed for it. I will be on treatment for it now and I'm confident in his abilities to help me. He is a very promising individual who will surely keep growing infinitely.",

Dr. Ankesh was very polite, friendly and made me feel at ease. My sonography was done in the clinic itself. After explaining the report, he prescribed certain medicines and provided a diet chart as well. He patiently answered all the queries and doubts I had regarding pcod and did not rush me through the process. Throughout the interaction, Dr. Ankesh was courteous and kind. After consulting him, I felt motivated and confident that I would be able to get rid of pcod. I was extremely satisfied with the consultation. ",

I have troubled him at odd hours asking him all kinds of silly questions about everything that struck my mind & he on the other hand was always very patient & calm n sweetly answered all my queries  , well i still do that :)) i would recommend him to all my friends , cos there cant be any other good doctor than them for me atleast , have been to many gynecologist but they were not half as good as them. My husband Navin is also a fan of them n keeps praising about how cool they are. Dr Ankesh thank you so much for everything and sorry for the trouble \nYou are a rockstar \nLove \nMehek Navin Zayn & Veer ",

My daughter and I were on the look out of a good gynaec who would be non judgmental make you feel comfortable. The quest stopped with Dr Ankesh. Responses to messages were very prompt. Quite surprised there was hardly any wait time. What struck me was that he gave us his time. We were not rushed. He was very current in his outlook toward sexual health rather than only going by the book or conditioning.  Easy to chat with and explained all our queries with clarity. Extremely empathetic to what women\u2019s sexual health issues. Lovely experience.  Highly recommended. \ud83d\ude03   ",

He is very friendly and a great human being. Dr. Ankesh throws away positivity around you and helps you with immense Perseverance and determination. Hez more of a friend than a doctor for sure....2) Dr. Divya is super smart, kind and most importantly leaves no stone unturned to give you the best chances for conceiving. Her analysis is detailed and thoughtful and that makes her my go-to gynaec. I have harassed her, with a lot of silly questions and each time she explains everything very patiently....Super grateful to have these lovely docs, in my journey towards motherhood.",

The treatment provided by him was very effective and i was able to do speedy recovery.  \nDr Ankesh is caring and he did keep following us on my health. Even the staff at his nursing home is extremely caring and attentive. I wish Dr Ankesh and his team good luck and would definitely recommend him. THANK YOU DOCTOR :)",

Both are doing a very grateful job seems like god showers blessing via them on us. One can rather say he is the best friend, mentor which explained things very nicely, minutely with all its pros & cons. Best Doctor ever I met. Highly recommend it to anyone who is facing any kind of  Gyno Problem. The Staff of the Hospital is also very friendly & helpful always. Feels Like now I'm in the right hands.

Finally after months of struggle I managed to go to him and yes it has helped me a lot. I Am posting this after a month of of my treatment and honestly I am glad I went to him n started my treatment. I can already see the difference in my health. Moreover, he\u2019s calm, polite, explains you everything from the illness to the medications he\u2019s prescribing you. So the anxiety is bare minimum and which is really great for me. I would honestly suggest to everyone I know. Thanks Dr Ankesh.",

You will be heard and treated with utmost care and respect. He will check out every concern you have - giving you holistic treatment! \n\nThe place is also extremely hygienic and the staff is friendly too! \n\nI feel safe in the hands of Dr. Ankesh.

I randomly scrolled through his Instagram stories on PCOS and immediately rushed to see him. I have been fighting PCOS since the last 18 years and have tried and tested everything but nothing really has helped. I was very impressed with his positive vibe, polite behaviour and deep rooted passion to treat every woman that walks into his clinic naturally with a few lifestyle and diet changes. He is not just a Doctor but a personal coach! I am excited to begin this new journey with Dr Ankesh and knock out PCOS from my life completely! ",

He suggested surgery/meds without pushing it. It was so refreshing.\n3. Extremely comfortable and easy to talk to. Very reassuring.\n4. Most important, he is non judgemental. Very kind and open to your thoughts and issues. Even when I'd did not agree to a few things he suggested he was understanding about it and open to discussing. Amazing!\n\nPlease visit him. I have gone to many doctors since a decade and not found someone who shows kindness to patients and believes them. I recommend fully!",

They attend to any of my queries. And Staff and nurses are all smiles and friendly and it feels really good. The facility of the hospital is nice n clean. There are no long hours of waiting.

He guided me through my options and each step of the all procedures with kindness and care. He took the time to explain everything thoroughly, ensuring that I fully understood what to expect. His willingness to answer my questions and address any concerns was truly reassuring. He is always available on whatsapp to answer any questions or concerns.\nDr. Ankesh's expertise and professionalism were evident throughout our interactions. I genuinely appreciated his commitment to providing the highest standard of care while maintaining a compassionate and respectful approach.\nI highly recommend Dr. Ankesh to anyone in need of gynecological care.

In all my past experiences, I always consulted lady doctors as I felt they would understand me better and make me feel more comfortable but I was very wrong in my thinking . Scheduling an in-person  appointment with Dr Ankesh was one of the best decisions of my life.\nHe takes his time to listen to you and answers every single question in detail. He provides the best advice and  will never suggest anything that might be risky or not right for you. I felt extremely comfortable at each appointment. \nI was very scared to get certain examinations due to my low tolerance of pain but he gave me confidence and assured me everything was going to be ok. He and the nurses are extremely patient and kind.  I felt like family members were taking care of me. He also provided counselling to my husband and I to prepare us for the future and for family planning. The entire experience was extremely comfortable and positive. \nThis is a family run practice and there is a lot of love and care shown towards the patients. I would recommend Dr Ankesh and Pushpa Hospital to women of all ages, whether you have questions in your mind regarding your health, general check up  or if you are thinking of family planning-  this is a one stop destination with the best people to take care of you",

However I got myself checked after reading alot about the subject, and turned out that there are cysts in my Ovaries. I came Across Dr. Ankesh Sahetya on Practo and honestly this was the best Doctor I could have found. He listens very patiently to the history, explains the issue in depth along with a practical model and provides effective solutions. Meeting a Doctor who is so positive and motivating instantly made me feel positive about the entire situation. I walked into the clinic feeling anxious and low and walked out with the calmest mind - the one that I haven't had in a long time. He also provides a complete diet chart and gives a life mantra - a way of leading a good life.\nHe explains, motivates and makes one feel so confident in such a way, that it ignites the inner spirit within to just get up, live a healthy lifestyle and just fight the disorders.\n\nHe is very prompt with answering all queries on WhatsApp even on Sundays (something which is very rare) . Finding a Doctor who genuinely cares so much about the health of his patients is really a blessing. With the treatment, Diet and a healthy lifestyle prescribed by Dr, I know for sure that I'm gonna kick off Pcod from my life for good! I'm so positive about it! Thanks to Dr. Ankesh Sahetya!",

After attending a lot of his online seminars, I gauged that Dr. Ankesh will definitely be extremely patient and positive and I was correct!\n\nAs the clinic is almost 3 hours from my place during peak hours, I was late for my appointment. But Dr. Ankesh was sweet enough to wait for us. Though there were patients before my appointment, the wait time was minimal, reception area is pretty neat & the staff extremely humble. \n\nEven though it was my first appointment & I was very nervous, his positivity is infectious! He ensures that you and your partner are extremely comfortable. The sonography was done in-house(super convenient) and by the doctor himself. He explains every bit of the diagnosis(what I never received from most doctors) & is an excellent counsellor. Dr. Ankesh has been my 4th overall, 3rd gynac for treatment of PCOS, and 1st ever male doctor. And I was mindblown to have found a doctor who doesn't make you feel - conscious, stressed or unheard. \n\nI finally see a ray of hope, hoping to heal under this holistic guidance!\n\n\n",

Dr. Ankesh sensed our nervousness immediately and put us at ease by making sure we knew that this is an unfamiliar, yet a common procedure. \n\nHe explained to us in detail the implications of going through with the procedure (we chose suction aspiration), both physically and emotionally. He also busted some popular myths about future conception, without mincing his words he educated us about the reproductive system and it\u2019s nature, a space that we all could gain more knowledge in. \n\nThe process overall was smooth, quick, transparent and pain free. We were made very comfortable by the hospital staff.\n\nWe would also like to add, that in a society like ours Dr. Ankesh and his staff\u2019s approach was free of judgement ehich put my husband and I at ease. Dr. Ankesh was extremely sensitive through the whole process and that helped build trust which will now last a lifetime. We will definitely continue being patrons of Dr. Ankesh\u2019s clinic and would very strongly recommend him. Thank you! ",

He first  understands  everything  before  suggesting the right treatment  suitably pertaining to my situation at that time. He keep in touch with the paintent through out and ensures all that was directed is completed properly Irrelevant to the time of day He complets, his duties with finesse and professionalism.He instructs u thought out the way and makes sure u are in good health and if something go wrong u can contact him and he is more then accommodative to sort what eva problems you might be face when u are doing the MPT procedure. As it is a tedious  and painful process but knowing u have ur doc as worried and concerned as you are  currently and ur doc right there making this much easier and safe to complete on your own. I am very happy  with him will keep him as my regular gynaecologist for future appointments and treatment for the years to come. For all of u reading this relax u can trust him and the discretion in sensitive matter like I did. good luck.... ",

The treatment he gave for the infection started showing results within a couple of days itself and it has already decreased considerably.Not only did he treat the infection but also gave tips on how to maintain hygiene to decrease the possibility of recurrence.He explained the problems in detail, with the help of simple diagrams so that I could understand my body and what was happening to it, which was very informative.He suggested I get a pap smear and a urine test done to ensure that there was no other underlying problem.He sent the soft copies of the test reports to me, which was very helpful since I couldn't collect them. He very kindly even checked up on me to ensure the medication was working and if I was feeling better.Overall, it was a very satisfactory experience. I recommend Dr. Sahetya to all, who are looking for a non judgmental doctor who pushed for patients comfort.",

I had visited a gynecologist earlier but the treatment recommended by her didn't solve the issue completely.  I came across Dr. Ankesh's profile via Practo and thus decided to visit him . To be very honest I was really nervous since this was the 1st time that I would be visiting any Male gynac. But Dr. Ankesh was so friendly and made me feel really comfortable . He advised and guided me just like a friend would do. He treats all his patients like someone would treat their own family members and makes  the patient feel very secure.  I would surely recommend him for all type of gynecological issues.  Thank you again Dr. Ankesh. ",

The facilities provided by the clinic were top class  and truly excellent. What impressed me the most was how absolutely nobody in the clinic was judgmental and were very kind and friendly towards me. As a young girl, alone, that mattered a lot to me. I would recommend Dr. Ankesh to any women who may be facing any gynecological issues. You will be in safe hands with him.",

While my symptoms stemmed from stopping prolonged use of hormone pills, the emotional turmoil was much more severe for me. Dr. Ankesh was very patient in hearing out the entire history without any judgment. I've lost hope on medication due to some experiences in the past. But Dr. Ankesh's sincere attempt at helping me regain balance has ignited a new ray of hope in me. He's very approachable and has treated the entire matter (and me) very sensitively. Thank you, Dr. Ankesh! Here's hoping that you're the magic wand I was looking for \ud83d\ude07",

He was so friendly that it didn\u2019t feel like it was my first time. From the time we entered, he made me super comfortable & at ease. He listened to me patiently about my pcod issues & told me the 3 life style modifications to make on an immediate basis for long term benefits as that would help me to sustain & make my life better with the pcos issue. The best part was that he didn\u2019t immediately put me on hormonal medicines without checking up my hormonal tests & told me to make certain changes before that. He also counselled me well & shared his guidance wrt dealing with anxiety/ mood swings & tld me to follow certain steps & routine which would reduce my stress levels & inturn my pcod. My mom & I were left extremely satisfied & positive at the end. Highly recommend  to go & visit him atleast once facing any pcod issue.",

They were extremely helpful in our emergency and made all the accommodations necessary for her treatment. The nurses and other staff were very attentive and took great care for her recovery. A special shout out to Dr. Ankesh - his approach especially when dealing with an aged patient, knowledge, expertise, detail oriented nature, medications, empathy and calm demeanor helped put us at ease...we were in really good hands at all times! We were pleasantly surprised when he stayed in touch after the discharge to check on her progress. Needless to say, the treatment worked very well, and my mom is cured. \nThank you Dr. Ankesh!",

Literally took a year to decide whether I should consult him or not but he turned out to be the best.\n\nReally looking forward to the treatment with him with a positive attitude.\n\nKudos to the Pushaa Hospital team as well, all are really friendly just like their doctor.",

If you're looking for a gynaecologist who is extremely understanding and talks through the entire process to you like a friend and is patient and kind enough to listen to you be indecisive, going back and forth your options and clarify every silly doubt that crosses your mind, Dr. Ankesh Sahetya is the gynaec for you. He is hands down the friendliest and nicest gynaec I've been to, he is super responsive on calls and texts (even during clinic hours) and I'd heartily reccomend him to anyone. In all honesty, a consultation with him felt like I was speaking to a friend who knew what I should be doing and he has made the entire treatment/process a gazillion times smoother for me. I am absolutely certain that after your very first consultation you'll be walking out writing an extremely kind review too. I'd strongly recommend him.",

We never felt like we were rushed into anything. \n\nDoctor Ankesh expained us about the do's and don'ts afterwards. We are so relieved that we finally did it! It wouldn't have been possible without doctor's guidance and support. \n\nThank you doc!",

In addition to this, he explained the entire treatment process in detail and also shared a diet plan (which is rarely shared by doctors). I would recommend doctor for his experience and treatment procedure, specially for teenage or millennials who feel quite uncomfortable or are hesitant visiting gynacs for period related issues. ",

We booked an appointment and immediately felt comfortable about going ahead . All was done in 2hours . \n\nDay one was very uncomfortable with cramps ,but day two felt like I had done nothing . So I think that my body has accepted the copper T well. Hoping it goes well in the coming few months with the flow  . \nVery happy with my experience and would highly recommend him.\n\n",

He was open to answering any question I had, as well as providing me with sound advice. The entire staff at the hospital were kind and comforting. I was very much at ease. It is doctor's like him that create a safe space for us to go to when we have such issues. I won't think twice before seeing him again, if the need arises. Highly recommended.",

He assured me that there's no reason to worry about the ovarian cyst found and it's just a matter of two months, with medicines, I will be completely alright. I am very happy to meet a very caring soul and, a lovely human being, Dr Ankesh Sahetya. I would highly recommend this doctor in Andheri for all gynaec problems and menstruation issues.

Ankesh made me feel so comfortable with his friendly approch that I did not hesitate to explain my problems to him and he assured me, with the right guidance, treatment and medicines I will feel much better. He did not rush and listened to my probs and his explanation was spot on. I even called Dr on his mobile phone as I wanted to check with him about few medicines and he was there to explain it to me over the phone and also recommend another doc for my other issue..Thank you Dr. Ankesh.",

Dr Ankesh was extremely patient and answered all my doubts . He gave me time and did not rush thru the process at all and gave me the comfort and support as needed . \nI feel confident that I am in good hands and don\u2019t have to look for another gynac ! Thank u doctor and look forward to a healthy next 9 months ! Cheers !!! ",

He is very detail-oriented and listens to your problems very patiently. The entire appointment was an eye-opener and I learned a lot as to what changes I need to make to improve my health.

He\u2019s super funny and chatty but also very smart as he customised my medical plan according to my body type and needs. Lastly honestly I was expecting someone to be very judgemental about my situation but he came in with an open mind and made me feel safe and comfortable throughout the whole process. Would highly recommend to anyone and everyone.  Thanks doc ",

I would rate the Dr. 10/10 according to his tenurety, hard work, dedication to work, presence of mind, kind nature, motivational spirit, down to earth and so called Mr. Perfectionist. I recommend Dr. Ankesh for the ones who is not having a child even after doing many treatments for years. Kindly contact Pushpaa Hospital, Lokhandwala Complex, Andheri (W).",

He also gave me important information about my reproductive health during the consultation that was unrelated to the issue I had come to him with, but has been helpful in my own understanding. I would highly recommend Dr. Sahetya to anyone seeking a doctor who consults without judgement, and gives all valid information, but leaves the decision entirely up to the patient. ",

Dr Ankesh is very polite and assures discretion wrt to such procedures especially for unmarried women like me. He's also very meticulous in explaining the situation and how he's going to go about with the treatment. Not even for once was I skeptical about anything or even remotely unsure of the whole process.\nHe's also very professional and was right on time for the procedure as well. I highly recommend anyone to definitely visit Dr Ankesh for any gynaecology related issues. ",

He will not leave you unexplained about your health issues as he strongly believes if you know your body problems well then only you will be able to tackle and fight it. He took out time to explain each and everything about pcos. He motivates you a lot.

He was so easy to talk to, took his time evaluating all possibilities and sharing them with me candidly. I went to check if I still have the ability to get pregnant post 40. He took all the necessary tests and scans to come up with a comprehensive treatment plan. His reassurance makes one hopeful. All my fears took a back seat thanks to his positivity.  Would highly recommend him to everyone. ",
