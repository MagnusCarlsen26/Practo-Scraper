I was diagnosed with secondary amenorrhea and had stopped menstruating, saw Dr. Hrishikesh pai as I was trying for conceiving since last 2 years with always a failure in my lap. He and his his team, my favourite Dr. Meenu handa came to my rescue. Not only she explained me so well in terms of what\u2019s been happening to my body, she always told me to keep hope that I can be a mother. After going to numerous doctors, spending lacs, I met this amazing doctor who in 2nd IVF cycle, miraculously made me pregnant and to my surprise with twins. I now have 2 beautiful daughters, who are healthy and happy babies. All thanks to Dr. Hrishikesh pai and Dr. Meenu handa. Love you guys.",
