My husband called her and mentioned about the problem and Dr Nanda helped us by constantly providing necessary medication over phone even though she was occupied with other work. Not to forget is Mrs Maria.  She is like a mother who constantly provides encouraging words and all the necessary tips. We were consulting with the doctor for 5 months and since we were planning for delivery at our hometown, we would miss Dr. Nanda's guidance and Maria aunty's encouraging words.

Facts when told to patient , u feel rude and arrogance.\n   \nThats your take .i have to be straight forward.

U both are super impatient, impulsive. \n      After jus paying 1 visit to Dr in clinic 15 days back, when Dr totally counselled about treatment protocol to understand first your normal physical response advised to complete your follicular study and visit. \n        Every now and then u just can't disturb Dr for your simple queries  when she is busy 'operating' some other patient in OT, treating some pt ,delivering baby or in some other important meeting or webinars etc.\n\n        Inspite of being in surgery mid I attended your call twice. First considering \"some emergency might b there\" .immediately after 5 mins u still called back even after knowing I'm in OT. \nIt's very obvious any Dr or anybody will say \" how many times u call \"for jus simple information when some important thing surgery is going on for some other pt. It's their \"valuable life\" we r attending and u keep on disturbing when it's not worth attending. U jus can simply drop a msg for such intimation,it will b reviewed later definitely. \n         Your simple queries had already been  answered by my assistant Dr many times before and not by receptionist. \n     Dr's no. is already there on file for real emergency services when pt needs she will be there in any hospital 100%, at any point of time but definitely not for very simple queries.U can ask ur queries and they will b solved by assistant Dr. \n\nU jus can't threaten / blackmail Dr and team  member. \n\n        In fact such negative reviews are most welcome as it gives us an opportunity to explain us better to understand us and to serve pts in more better ways.

She made us understand that its always not about medicine but positive thinking and perseverance. She gave us magic medicine also \ud83d\ude00, yes you read that right. After following healthy routine with proper diet and exercise my wife finally concieved within 2 months. \nPlease remember, donot loose patience. Good news is round the corner, just work for it with complete dedication. Me and wife reccomend Dr. Nanda Kumar, 100 out of 100 times.

Not to forget is Mrs Maria.  She is like a mother who constantly provides encouraging words and all the necessary tips. We were consulting with the doctor for 5 months and since we were planning for delivery at our hometown, we would miss Dr. Nanda's guidance and Maria aunty's encouraging words.

Facts when told to patient , u feel rude and arrogance.\n   \nThats your take .i have to be straight forward. I cant hide anything from you..\n\nYou have to accept facts and work towards it.\nNeed whole investigations related to pcod / pcos  and assessment which is never done in your case.\n\nPlease take care .

First considering \"some emergency might b there\" .immediately after 5 mins u still called back even after knowing I'm in OT. \nIt's very obvious any Dr or anybody will say \" how many times u call \"for jus simple information when some important thing surgery is going on for some other pt. It's their \"valuable life\" we r attending and u keep on disturbing when it's not worth attending. U jus can simply drop a msg for such intimation,it will b reviewed later definitely. \n         Your simple queries had already been  answered by my assistant Dr many times before and not by receptionist. \n     Dr's no. is already there on file for real emergency services when pt needs she will be there in any hospital 100%, at any point of time but definitely not for very simple queries.U can ask ur queries and they will b solved by assistant Dr. \n\nU jus can't threaten / blackmail Dr and team  member. \n\n        In fact such negative reviews are most welcome as it gives us an opportunity to explain us better to understand us and to serve pts in more better ways.

She had to conduct a biopsy also on me which went very smoothly and helped understand my health condition better. I would definitely recommend Dr. Kumar to everyone.",

After the consultation and tests, I got to know that I had pcod and thyroid disorder, both of which were contributing to weight gain as well. Dr. Nanda gave medication for regularisation of hormones as well as told me to reduce my weight. I took charge of my diet and lifestyle, along with the medicines. As on date, I am cleared of pcod and thyroid, and have also got normal periods without medicines. One thing I really liked about the doctor was that she gives medicine only when it is absolutely required. She also has a very warm approach to her patients. I am really thankful to her for getting my health back in order.",
