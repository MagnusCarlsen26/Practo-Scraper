I have a very rare uterus abnormality which he diagnosed in the frst go and he made it possible for me. I have given birth to my miracle baby 10 months back and I shall always always (I mean it from the bottom of my heart) be grateful to him. \nAlso to add here, his clinic\u2019s staff is THE BEST. ",
