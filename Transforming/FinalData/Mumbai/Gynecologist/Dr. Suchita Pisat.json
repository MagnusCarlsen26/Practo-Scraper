Nusring staff was very helpful. Dr. Suchita Pisat (our gynaecologist) special thanks to her - very supportive and positive in each and every stage of complete pregnancy. Highly recommended for all. Very good service by the hospital.\nThank you for the wonderful care taken by Aakansha metering hospital  and whole team....\n\n\n#Sandesh / Shalaka Bovne",
