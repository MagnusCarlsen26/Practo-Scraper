The journey was about to see new roads, feel excitement and get to know the best Doctor ever that one can have.I had several issues in the earlier months which were severe but the smile, positive energy, treatment and guidance by Vibha Ma'am helped me overcome all obstacles during these crucial times. She is a doctor who is at the patient's service 24x7.She has called me herself, reminding me of what needs to be done from time to time, checking on my health which I could never expect any doctor to do.To me she has become just not my Doctor but her behaviour has made me think of her as someone from my own family.That is how she takes care of her patients.At the end of my pregnancy, when it was an extremely critical situation, such that I could have lost my baby forever,due to sudden internal complications, Ma'am took the right decision at the right time, even when the reports couldn't detect the issue. She saved my baby's life by her prompt decision and action and has blessed my life with a bundle of joy.Even after the delivery, Vibha Ma'am has taken such good care of me all the time.She has always placed my life and best interest before anything else. I am blessed to have Vibha Arora in my life .She is my God send Angel.Can never thank her enough and Thank you can never suffice for what she has done for me.",

Well, Dr. Vibha made it so easy for us to trust with her simplicity and clarity of explanation from the very first visit. \nI had been ailing for almost 3 years with a menopausal condition (endometriosis and fibroids and else). I had delayed further cos of the pandemic. \nDr. Vibha Arora put our fears at ease as she specified the path of treatment I needed to take. She ensured I was mentally, emotionally and physically prepped for the  initial DNC and then later the lap-hysterectomy and for all the tests in between. \nI have paid up for the surgery and procedures but I shall always be in her debt for the kindness showed ~ she replied to my every call and even whatsapp and was very meticulous and gentle yet confident in her approach. She is extremely patient with her patients (I've overheard her talking with others in the hospital) \nMy surgery was challenging and complicated and yet I am healing and free. \nI would definitely recommend Dr. Vibha to anyone with a gyanec situation along with a piece of advice - Ladies, please do not delay. Give yourself priority and make time for self care.",

Dr Vibha always listened and answered our questions with warmth, patience and the scientific details that we were looking for.\n\nDr Vibha was approachable and available in emergency, which was especially important as my office work required me to travel between cities almost every week. Once during my 2nd trimester while I was out for shopping I had an emergency - debilitating chest and back pain, sweating and chills due to hypotension. Dr Vibha guided my husband on phone on how to alleviate my condition which helped me get back to normal. Despite it being a Sunday and me having returned to normal, Dr Vibha travelled to hospital so that she could see me. On another occasion when I was out of Mumbai for work I had similar problem. Yet again Dr Vibha was constantly in touch over phone until my situation came back to normal.\n\nIn last two weeks of pregnancy one of my placental metric was abnormally high. During this time as well Dr Vibha provided great care. I had a very good delivery experience with her. We feel blessed to have had such a capable and good natured doctor in our pregnancy journey. ",

At Cloudnine we began our consulting journey with Dr. Vibha Arora who is extremely sharp and goes the extra mile to ensure her patient has the most informed pregnancy. Dr . Vibha is an angel of sorts and has been our biggest pillar of support away from our family in Mumbai . Our pregnancy journey was not the smoothest but Dr. Vibha managed each and every exigency with elan and with the kind warmth which is her most remarkable aspect . We would be forever grateful to her and the hospital for the ultimate care and ensuring the well being of our newborn daughter . ",

The journey was about to see new roads, feel excitement and get to know the best Doctor ever that one can have.I had several issues in the earlier months which were severe but the smile, positive energy, treatment and guidance by Vibha Ma'am helped me overcome all obstacles during these crucial times. She is a doctor who is at the patient's service 24x7.She has called me herself, reminding me of what needs to be done from time to time, checking on my health which I could never expect any doctor to do.To me she has become just not my Doctor but her behaviour has made me think of her as someone from my own family.That is how she takes care of her patients.At the end of my pregnancy, when it was an extremely critical situation, such that I could have lost my baby forever,due to sudden internal complications, Ma'am took the right decision at the right time, even when the reports couldn't detect the issue. She saved my baby's life by her prompt decision and action and has blessed my life with a bundle of joy.Even after the delivery, Vibha Ma'am has taken such good care of me all the time.She has always placed my life and best interest before anything else. I am blessed to have Vibha Arora in my life .She is my God send Angel.Can never thank her enough and Thank you can never suffice for what she has done for me.",

I had delayed further cos of the pandemic. \nDr. Vibha Arora put our fears at ease as she specified the path of treatment I needed to take. She ensured I was mentally, emotionally and physically prepped for the  initial DNC and then later the lap-hysterectomy and for all the tests in between. \nI have paid up for the surgery and procedures but I shall always be in her debt for the kindness showed ~ she replied to my every call and even whatsapp and was very meticulous and gentle yet confident in her approach. She is extremely patient with her patients (I've overheard her talking with others in the hospital) \nMy surgery was challenging and complicated and yet I am healing and free. \nI would definitely recommend Dr. Vibha to anyone with a gyanec situation along with a piece of advice - Ladies, please do not delay. Give yourself priority and make time for self care.",

Dr Vibha always listened and answered our questions with warmth, patience and the scientific details that we were looking for.\n\nDr Vibha was approachable and available in emergency, which was especially important as my office work required me to travel between cities almost every week. Once during my 2nd trimester while I was out for shopping I had an emergency - debilitating chest and back pain, sweating and chills due to hypotension. Dr Vibha guided my husband on phone on how to alleviate my condition which helped me get back to normal. Despite it being a Sunday and me having returned to normal, Dr Vibha travelled to hospital so that she could see me. On another occasion when I was out of Mumbai for work I had similar problem. Yet again Dr Vibha was constantly in touch over phone until my situation came back to normal.\n\nIn last two weeks of pregnancy one of my placental metric was abnormally high. During this time as well Dr Vibha provided great care. I had a very good delivery experience with her. We feel blessed to have had such a capable and good natured doctor in our pregnancy journey. ",

We initially thought of going to a multispecialty hospital but experiencing the service there we decided against it . At Cloudnine we began our consulting journey with Dr. Vibha Arora who is extremely sharp and goes the extra mile to ensure her patient has the most informed pregnancy. Dr . Vibha is an angel of sorts and has been our biggest pillar of support away from our family in Mumbai . Our pregnancy journey was not the smoothest but Dr. Vibha managed each and every exigency with elan and with the kind warmth which is her most remarkable aspect . We would be forever grateful to her and the hospital for the ultimate care and ensuring the well being of our newborn daughter . ",

She was extremely hands-on when finding out we were expecting twins, always available to take our queries any time of the day. An experience we will never forget! She guided me in my pregnancy nutrition and mental well being throughout with lots of patience.Thank you for making sure me and the twins were constantly being monitored with non-stress tests and ultrasounds- it was all worth it! The twins are beautiful and they are very healthy! I have had a very comfortable pregnancy, labour and delivery with my Doctor right by my side throughout. This was surely a memorable experience due to your care and expertise. ",
