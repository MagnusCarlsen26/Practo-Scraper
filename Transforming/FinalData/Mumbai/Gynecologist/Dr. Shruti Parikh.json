Through out the course of treatment she kept us informed about the whole process and always offered us the right treatment. She is professional in her approach and really a very honest human being. Most of times, Couples like us do not understand such treatments and are very nervous about the way ahead. But Dr. Shruti explained to us in very detail about the whole treatment, explaining all the terminologies. She is Calm Composed and has a natural knack in lowering your worries. I called her many times during our treatment and she was available each and every time and explained to us all our queries. Even she went out of the way in arranging the right medicines for us. She has a positive vibe which install confidence in you every time you talk to her. She gives lot of attention to details. She could have easily asked us to go for IVF directly and we would have even agreed. But she went through proper process. \n\nThank you Madam for all your help. We would always be grateful to you because it is only because of you, we are on our way to have our first Baby. No words will be enough to explain the joy you bought us in our life. \n\nWe recommend Dr. Shruti to every Couple who have difficulty in conceiving. *** ** *** **** ****** ** ****** * We are very grateful to her.",

After ineffective line of treatments and disappointments in the past, Dr. Shruti gave us a new ray of hope. She counselled us thoroughly in our first meeting and explained all options which made us feel secured and hopeful in this otherwise stressful journey of TTC with infertility. Dr. Shruti is passionate and ensures she gives you the right amount of information and logical reasoning for every step taken in the treatment process. There were no unnecessary medicines or tests suggested, she was methodical and reassuring throughout and also ensure I am comfortable with the process. She was also available on WhatsApp to resolve doubts/queries without hesitation despite her busy schedule. I feel blessed to have been treated by her and most important of all thanks to her patience and positive approach to any roadblocks along the way and that today under her guidance we are finally pregnant with our first child. I would highly recommend Dr. Shruti to all the couple struggling to conceive or even those who want expert advice on family planning and future options. Heartfelt thanks Dr. Shruti, wishing you abundant success in your profession.",

                "review_text": "This is the review I am writing after our one-year journey with Dr. Shruti ma'am.\n\nWe were planning our second child, and during that time, my wife had two spontaneous miscarriages with pregnancies of less than two months. After the last miscarriage, it was almost 1.5 years; she could not even conceive. We were getting impatient. In between, we changed our gynecologist and moved to a second one who suggested she has PCOS. After a few months of PCOS treatment and seeing no improvement, we thought of taking a second opinion.\n\nI had seen the board of Shruti ma'am clinic on link road earlier but was hesitant then. As it was COVID time,  we consulted online Shruti ma'am on our first call. During that call, she ruled out PCOS. She logically explained that the AMH level of my wife is small, so it can't be PCOS. It was a big realization for us that we were on the wrong track, and we immediately switched to ma'am.\n\nDuring this one-year journey, we have seen her closely putting tremendous efforts for us to see the result. She will constantly carry out some improvements in medicines and herself will do the follicular scan. Instead of just believing in ultrasound reports, she will present there to see if everything is fine. She will follow the path methodically and logically.\n\nShe is a confident and amazing doctor. She is available round the clock for you to handle any emergency or query. She will make the patient feel at ease and will provide moral support. Her presence gives very positive vibes and makes you believe you will see your baby one day. In the beginning, I was skeptical seeing all the 5 star reviews, but I now realize the reason for them.\n\nDue to her efforts, my wife has now conceived and is now in 3rd month. We have got some wisdom during this time. For those struggling to conceive for more than a year, better see a fertility specialist as a regular gynecologist won't be of much help. If you are with Shruti ma'am, just follow her guidance regarding medicines, injections, tests, etc., and trust her instincts. Believe me; you will reach your goal timely with that.\n\nJust as ma'am is wonderful, her staff at the clinic also deserves the same praise. They are cooperative and ready to help you out with small small things.\n\nLastly, ma'am, thank you is a very small word to say for what you have given us. Throughout our life, we will be grateful to you for the joy you have brought in our life.",

She is a perfect Doctor you can find. She is Compassionate, Knowledgeable, Understanding and Kind. Through out the course of treatment she kept us informed about the whole process and always offered us the right treatment. She is professional in her approach and really a very honest human being. Most of times, Couples like us do not understand such treatments and are very nervous about the way ahead. But Dr. Shruti explained to us in very detail about the whole treatment, explaining all the terminologies. She is Calm Composed and has a natural knack in lowering your worries. I called her many times during our treatment and she was available each and every time and explained to us all our queries. Even she went out of the way in arranging the right medicines for us. She has a positive vibe which install confidence in you every time you talk to her. She gives lot of attention to details. She could have easily asked us to go for IVF directly and we would have even agreed. But she went through proper process. \n\nThank you Madam for all your help. We would always be grateful to you because it is only because of you, we are on our way to have our first Baby. No words will be enough to explain the joy you bought us in our life. \n\nWe recommend Dr. Shruti to every Couple who have difficulty in conceiving. *** ** *** **** ****** ** ****** * We are very grateful to her.",

She counselled us thoroughly in our first meeting and explained all options which made us feel secured and hopeful in this otherwise stressful journey of TTC with infertility. Dr. Shruti is passionate and ensures she gives you the right amount of information and logical reasoning for every step taken in the treatment process. There were no unnecessary medicines or tests suggested, she was methodical and reassuring throughout and also ensure I am comfortable with the process. She was also available on WhatsApp to resolve doubts/queries without hesitation despite her busy schedule. I feel blessed to have been treated by her and most important of all thanks to her patience and positive approach to any roadblocks along the way and that today under her guidance we are finally pregnant with our first child. I would highly recommend Dr. Shruti to all the couple struggling to conceive or even those who want expert advice on family planning and future options. Heartfelt thanks Dr. Shruti, wishing you abundant success in your profession.",

                "review_text": "This is the review I am writing after our one-year journey with Dr. Shruti ma'am.\n\nWe were planning our second child, and during that time, my wife had two spontaneous miscarriages with pregnancies of less than two months. After the last miscarriage, it was almost 1.5 years; she could not even conceive. We were getting impatient. In between, we changed our gynecologist and moved to a second one who suggested she has PCOS. After a few months of PCOS treatment and seeing no improvement, we thought of taking a second opinion.\n\nI had seen the board of Shruti ma'am clinic on link road earlier but was hesitant then. As it was COVID time,  we consulted online Shruti ma'am on our first call. During that call, she ruled out PCOS. She logically explained that the AMH level of my wife is small, so it can't be PCOS. It was a big realization for us that we were on the wrong track, and we immediately switched to ma'am.\n\nDuring this one-year journey, we have seen her closely putting tremendous efforts for us to see the result. She will constantly carry out some improvements in medicines and herself will do the follicular scan. Instead of just believing in ultrasound reports, she will present there to see if everything is fine. She will follow the path methodically and logically.\n\nShe is a confident and amazing doctor. She is available round the clock for you to handle any emergency or query. She will make the patient feel at ease and will provide moral support. Her presence gives very positive vibes and makes you believe you will see your baby one day. In the beginning, I was skeptical seeing all the 5 star reviews, but I now realize the reason for them.\n\nDue to her efforts, my wife has now conceived and is now in 3rd month. We have got some wisdom during this time. For those struggling to conceive for more than a year, better see a fertility specialist as a regular gynecologist won't be of much help. If you are with Shruti ma'am, just follow her guidance regarding medicines, injections, tests, etc., and trust her instincts. Believe me; you will reach your goal timely with that.\n\nJust as ma'am is wonderful, her staff at the clinic also deserves the same praise. They are cooperative and ready to help you out with small small things.\n\nLastly, ma'am, thank you is a very small word to say for what you have given us. Throughout our life, we will be grateful to you for the joy you have brought in our life.",

Knocked the doors of top notch doctors yet failed in figuring out the issue. Consulted Dr Shruti as our last hope. She was calm and gave all her ears to our queries throughout the visits. She explained every reports in layman\u2019s terms which gave us comfort in trusting her knowledge. During the treatment she found out the root cause of the issue and due to her exceptional medical knowledge we are blessed with a baby girl. Our lives are filled with joy. We highly recommend and encourage all those couples who are undergoing infertility to consult Dr Shruti for the best result. ",

During this examination, I was diagnosed with multiple fibroids and she suggested me to go through Myomectomy to ensure it does not create any issues while conceiving. \nEntire procedure was taken by her and I did not face any challenges. Through out the course of treatment she kept us informed about the whole process and always offered us the right treatment. \nI messaged her many times during our treatment and she was available each and every time and responded to all our queries.  She gave us ample time and resolved all our questions and queries without rushing during face to face consultation as well. I am grateful that I made decision to choose Dr Shruti who brought happiness in our Life.\nI will recommend all couples to visit Dr Shruti for consultations.",

During our entire time with her there were no unnecessary medicines or tests suggested, she knew exactly what she was doing  and was methodical and reassuring throughout and also ensured that I was comfortable with the process.

Now is the stage where I know if she is around, I am okay and in safe hands. I know when it is her, things will be more than okay and she can possibly do anything and everything possible in her hands to make it happen for you. I am saying this because I have witnessed it myself with me in life as I write this. It\u2019s like truly having an older sister around with so much warmth and friendliness, it is easy to share, open up with your matters, discuss in a healthy way  with complete logic and rational and make it happen.

The doctor will not try to put you on unnecessary medication or treatments until all the natural ways to conceive do not seem to materialize. She will listen to all your queries & concerns and answer all of them. I was really nervous due to my last pregnancy, but the doctor was very patient and makes you feel comfortable to share your doubts. After 3 months, I was able to conceive naturally! All thanks to Dr. Shruti! ",
