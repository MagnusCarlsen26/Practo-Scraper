Many other doctors had suggested for open surgery but Dr Sanket was confident of removing by\u00a0 lapro method. He explained us entire procedure and all possible options so we were totally at ease before the surgery!\nAlso gave us a wide choice of hospitals... being on a narrow budget we could choose a low cost alternative, but it was still done fully cashless. Thanks Dr Pisat God Bless!",

When he saw the MRI reports he said that there might be chances of open surgery if any complications comes during the laproscopic procedure, as she was already operated in 2014 for uterus removal with open surgery the doctor was trying his level best that this should be done with laproscopic procedure.\nThe operation was successful and we are so happy that it was done through laproscopic procedure only.\nThanks to Dr. Sanket Pisat my mom is fine now and she is recovering well.\nDr. Sanket is so kind and helpful and he alway encourages his patients thats makes him different from all.\nThanks a lot Sir.
