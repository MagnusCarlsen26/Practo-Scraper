"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Adenomyosis Treatment,",0,0,YES,"We consulted Doctor Sunayana for the gynelogical problems faced by my wife especially the side effects of growing fibroids. The USG and MRI also indicated Adenomyosis and cysts and we were quite worried. The doctor explained to us about the issue, the treatment, risks and side effects. She also explained about the technicalities of the harmonic laproscopy and the short discharge and recovery time. She came across as quite professional, confident, calm amd empathetic. She assured us of an effective treatment. The operation went through successfully and we are quite happy with recovery. I would recommend her given our experience.",2022-03-25 16:48:23,False,True,Akash Shrivastava,Thank you,2022-03-26T13:11:43+0000,Dr. Sunayana Dubey
,,0,0,YES,"I have been consulting Dr. Sunayna since last 10 years. She has been instrumental in solving my gynecological related issues and thereby facilitating  the birth of my son who is now 9 years old healthy baby.
Just few days back she has treated me for fibroids; I used to feel severe stomach pain during my periods since last 2 years, had consulted other doctors prior to finally reaching out to Dr.Sunayna. After meeting Dr.Sunayna, I received the proper guidance consultation and most importantly cleared all the my doubts and removed whatever fear and myths I had about Fibroids. I took the treatment, being operated through laser treatment and now I am back to my normal best within few days..

Strongly recommend her for any gynecological related treatment. ",2022-01-31 18:22:25,False,True,Nisha zende,Thank you,2022-03-14T05:45:17+0000,Dr. Sunayana Dubey
