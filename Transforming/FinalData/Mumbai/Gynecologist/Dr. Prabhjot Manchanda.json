We ended up with Prabhjot. \n\nTrust me, At the end of my second trimester i forced my parents to come to Mumbai because i felt more comfortable and safe with Prabhjot.\n\nFirst of all she is the best doctor i met till now, Why?\n1. She is good listener, and explains everything in detail.\n2. She treated me like a friend with in 2-3 visits, and she remembered all my records. Every time we felt like we are going to meet a friend.\n3. Best thing is, She responded for all my messages and calls with smile. Trust me i had hundreds of silly doubts, but i got answers for all with smile.\n4. Available all the time. She use to ask my permission to go on vacation. One can never expect this from a doc.\n5.  It was normal delivery!!. no one in my family believed it because i was considered as unfit for normal delivery :).\n6. Delivery counselling was very helpful. Being a biology/pharmacy student i could understand lot of it. \n\nMy baby is 4 months old now. He is doing great.\n\nI am very thankful to Prabhjot for her help in my most memorable pregnancy period. I recommend her!!\n\nAlekhya & Chandra ",

We ended up with Prabhjot. \n\nTrust me, At the end of my second trimester i forced my parents to come to Mumbai because i felt more comfortable and safe with Prabhjot.\n\nFirst of all she is the best doctor i met till now, Why?\n1. She is good listener, and explains everything in detail.\n2. She treated me like a friend with in 2-3 visits, and she remembered all my records. Every time we felt like we are going to meet a friend.\n3. Best thing is, She responded for all my messages and calls with smile. Trust me i had hundreds of silly doubts, but i got answers for all with smile.\n4. Available all the time. She use to ask my permission to go on vacation. One can never expect this from a doc.\n5.  It was normal delivery!!. no one in my family believed it because i was considered as unfit for normal delivery :).\n6. Delivery counselling was very helpful. Being a biology/pharmacy student i could understand lot of it. \n\nMy baby is 4 months old now. He is doing great.\n\nI am very thankful to Prabhjot for her help in my most memorable pregnancy period. I recommend her!!\n\nAlekhya & Chandra ",
