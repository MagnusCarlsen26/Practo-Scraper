"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"If you are in Mumbai !!! There can be no better choice then Dr.Anita Mohan!!!
When I got pregnant I was in Banglore for first 3 months and in Calicut for 2nd Trimester reached Mumbai for my 3rd Trimester as my parents are in Mumbai.
Due to pandemic I was really concerned on travelling but I am glad I did and happened to visit Dr. Anita !!! Looks like gods plan to give the bestüòç! Since I experienced 3 doctors from 3 states, without any doubt I recommend her for Pregnancy. Following are the that are super impressive about her ( but not limited to üòé) 
1) She is punctual to the minute. You don‚Äôt have to wait to meet her at all( wherein I have waited minimum 45 mins at other hospitals) .
2) You don‚Äôt feel you are rushed for consultation at all. She explains you minute of the details.3)You are helped not only with physical issues but you get supported emotionally as well.4)She is very organised with everything(which you see missing in a lot of hospitals) 5)I had a C - section and procedure went so smooth.6) She will make sure you get the best experience.
Her work is her passion!!",2021-04-10 10:40:29,False,True,Sajina sasidharan,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Obstetrics / Antenatal Care,",0,0,YES,"I visited Dr. Anitha while she was with Fortis BG Road Bangalore back in 2016. Like a God sent, we had just moved to Bangalore and I found out I was pregnant. All through my 3 trimesters and post natal she had been amazing. She is so kind and patient specially in explaining the procedures, tests and all queries you have as a patient/ to-be parents/new parents. Can never forget, the day I got into labour she was scheduled for an event on Breastfeeding but she chose to be with me and conduct my delivery leaving the event.... So yes, she will be my first and only recommendation. ",2022-12-16 06:30:11,False,True,Mahima Atishaya,,,
