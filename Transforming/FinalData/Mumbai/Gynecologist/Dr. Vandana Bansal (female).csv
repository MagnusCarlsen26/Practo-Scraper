,,0,0,YES,"Dr Vandana is an excellent professional. As a foreign citizen from the very beginning of my pregnancy I was stuck in India because of the pandemic, she guided me perfectly throughout such a complex period and under difficult circumstances. She is the most meticulous doctor I have ever met. She pays attention to every tiny detail, she follows up the patients very closely and she works out a solution to any problem no matter what it is. She is very communicative and even compassionate; she explains everything to the patients and she informs the patients about all the options and processes. Occasionally, waiting time can be too long for a regular visit but it is definitely worth it because she gives the time they require to all the patients. A medical problem related to pregnancy is a very sensitive subject. As a foreigner and as a Phd I was very doubtful and picky yet I felt very comfortable after I met her. I have complete trust in her expertise and experience. I completely rely upon her advice and I feel very luck to have her as my doctor.",2020-09-28 06:30:58,False,True,Isil Ã§elik,,,
,"Maternal Fetal Medicine,",0,0,YES,"*** * ****** ******* ** ****** ******* *** ************** I had CVS done with her .procedure was smooth.Explains options , advice is good and practical.no doubt about her expertise

Cons:
1)Expect delay of 1hour every time
2) There is bit of  gossiping amongst assistant doctor and her around patient's ignorance and decision making behind their back in the clinic, overheard it quite a few times for previous patients while I was waiting-found thus against professional ethics .Could be more sensitive to patient's emotional state .Overheard things like ""she calls me for small things like spotting"" talking abt a pregnant patient with assistant.
