"Wait time,","Vaginal Infection Treatment,",0,0,NO,"Doctor was unavailable for more than 45 minutes from appointment time. The Staff was not clear and misguided on wait time. We could not meet the doctor at all.

My mother 73 years old could not wait for an seemingly long time due to COVID related risks prevailing in our area.

I would recommend the staff and the doctor maintain some transparency and proactive communication with patients who are waiting for consultation.

If the staff could have informed us yesterday via a phone call to come later as doctor was unavailable it would have saved us a lot of inconvenience.
