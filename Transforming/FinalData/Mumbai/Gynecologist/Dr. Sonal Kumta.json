My case was a high-risk pregnancy, so all the necessary tests were done on time. In the third trimester, my platelets went severely down and I had been asked to get admitted; however, with the help of Fortis Hematologist right treatments were given to increase the platelet count. Dr. Sonal was fully prepared for all scenarios and we were explained all possibilities in detail for delivery. Very safe delivery was done considering all risks for my health and also for the baby's health. We are very thankful to meet such an amazing doctor.",

My case was a high-risk pregnancy, so all the necessary tests were done on time. In the third trimester, my platelets went severely down and I had been asked to get admitted; however, with the help of Fortis Hematologist right treatments were given to increase the platelet count. Dr. Sonal was fully prepared for all scenarios and we were explained all possibilities in detail for delivery. Very safe delivery was done considering all risks for my health and also for the baby's health. We are very thankful to meet such an amazing doctor.",

A doctor you can trust and have faith in!\n\nI had seen the doc for my entire period starting from pre-conception checkups to the delivery and Dr sonal handled all test/checkup very well. She won't ask for any test that are not required and don't unnecessarily burden you with checkups and  test. She goes with the normal flow and do as per the need.  \n\nA humble person, soft-spoken and a very patient person who answered all the queries well. ",
