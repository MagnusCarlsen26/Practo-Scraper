We were in a very confused state during the pandemic times as every report  of mine was showing different things. But she helped us by efficiency taking all the steps needed as per her clinical findings and finally I had a normal delivery in May 2020. She was very helpful during the tough lockdown times and was always available when needed. I am very thankful to her and would strongly recommend to approach her for consulation.",
