"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnant,Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"We had been trying for pregnancy for last 1 and had half year. Had met various gynecologists' on the way but it didn’t help.. had almost lost our hope and confidence.
We came to know about Dr. Sonal Katwala thru one of our close friend who had recently became pregnant under her guidance. So we thought of meeting her.
We had great experience as a first timer.
I especially loved how Dr. Sonal really took her time to explain my conditions with me as well as my treatment options.
Knowledgeable, sensitive, informative… I immediately felt at ease – and felt confident in my receiving expert medical care.
Under her guidance I too became pregnant and was one of my happiest day of my life.
Treatment under Dr. Sonal was great during my whole pregnancy period, but one tragedy struck just 15 days before my delivery date. I became Covid positive.
We as a to be parents for the first time got  scared and all negative thoughts surrounded us.
But Dr. Sonal was calm and positive in that situation. She immediately suggested for C-section delivery and we immediately got hospitalized.
She was physically present during whole surgery with other covid specialists doctors. Surgery was successful and we were happy Parents.
We really appreciate her for all the effort taken by her during Covid period.
Dr. Sonal Katwala is incredible. Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment.
I highly recommend becoming her patient!",2021-07-18 14:01:38,False,True,Akshata,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy care and management,",0,0,YES,"2 months after I had had a missed abortion (no heart beat was detected till the 8th week & therefore the pregnancy had to be clinically terminated), when I was scouting for a doctor closer home to save on the travelling I found Dr. Sonal’s profile on Practo with some really positive reviews & booked an appointment with her – This, I now believe was the single most important step I took towards having my baby! Given my earlier failed attempt at having a baby, I was pretty low on confidence & had a very cautious & negative approach towards my prospects at becoming a mother. The detection of a fibroid & chocolate cyst in my pre-pregnancy scans made it only worse. However, Dr. Sonal remained positive & asked us to try naturally for 6 months before we consider other options. As luck would have it we achieved success early & step by step in each appointment, Dr. Sonal managed to increase our confidence with her calm & positive approach. 
The thing I liked most about her is that she has no frills – She gives you the facts as they are, doesn’t panic * **** *** ** ** *********** ****** patiently answers your questions (however silly they may be) & explains her prescriptions – i.e, what purpose each of the medicines she’s prescribing serves – This helps a great deal! Especially since most women begin taking medicines as a routine for the first time in their lives when pregnant & knowing what each medicine is for, helps commit to the routine! – at least it worked wonders for me
Lastly, I was always fixated at having a ‘Normal Delivery’, she asked me to be mentally prepared for both & I did, considering my history & the fact that I was delivering a baby at a ‘not so favourable’ age of 32yrs. But when the time came, she ensured that she does everything in her hand to facilitate a Normal delivery for me & my baby! In the OT too, it was her calm & clear instructions that guided me through the pain & helped me get done with the delivery in under 10mins! Just trust her to do the right thing & you will be through!! That’s what I did!",2020-01-09 05:41:43,False,True,Reshma Vaidya,,,

After my PCOS treatment we decided to plan a baby under her guidance. She suggested follicular study of ovulation as i had irregular period cycle of sometimes 45days to 60days. In 3rd follicular cycle i conceived. Right from pre pregnancy guidance to through the pregnancy and post that, the experience has been very satisfactory and wonderful. She has been extremely honest, always gave us clear instructions and advice. She was always available a phone call away during any urgent situation. The every 15 days follow ups helped to judge any complications in the pregnancy. Sterling hospital that she suggested was also extremely good in terms of ventilation, cleanliness and service.  I aimed for a normal delivery, however, it looked difficult as even after 24hrs of labour journey i wasn't dilated as needed. I had an emergency C-section but it went extremely smooth.
