Silently & smoothly she practiced as very popular Gynec Surgeon mainly for lower & middle class of this area. Thus fulfilling the dream of professional career with social service. Her hospital earns excellent reputation of honesty & a place of economical treatment.  Apart from routine Gynecologist and Obstetrician practice, she kept pace with various technological advances necessary for excellent care of patients - Endoscopy surgeries, Sonography, high risk pregnancy etc. Ultra modern high-tech Operation Theater is an integral part of her setup. Good ventilated A/C rooms with facilities like T.V., Fridge, and intercom are some added services in this 15-beded hospital.

Her private practice focuses on quality care with affordable cost. Added to this is her personal care & very supportive relationship to help poor & needy patients.

This philosophy is very much explained to the staff so that a pregnant woman is treated differently   She has successfully carried out more than 9000 Procedures including Minor & High Risk Surgeries in her hospital.
