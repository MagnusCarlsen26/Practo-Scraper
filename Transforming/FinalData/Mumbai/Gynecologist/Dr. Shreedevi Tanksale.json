She is really friendly, makes you feel comfortable, pays attention and is extra careful when you're anxious. The consultation process is also pretty convenient as she herself does the scan so you don't have to run between clinic and diagnostic centre for routine scans/sonography . She recommends to get only certain scans done through diagnostic centre which is again completely monitored by her. Also, she is actively there to respond to any of your queries/concerns over whatsapp which again helped us a lot. We were able to conceive naturally under her guidance. I highly recommend her. ",

She has briefed me everything so well about how to conceive & what are other options if person is unable to conceive naturally. She never forced us for any other treatment always insisted us to try naturally. She recommended us to eat homemade food & completely avoid junk food. During my treatment, once she was not available in city, under her guidance we have tried to conceive naturally & the result is i am 3 months pregnant. During my 1 Trimester I have faced morning sickness & leg ache so I have asked her to give some medicines but she never gave any supplements for vitamins & proteins but insisted me to intake from Leafy vegetables, fruits etc.. All credit goes to her.  Very friendly doctor i have ever met. I would recommend her.",

The consultation process is also pretty convenient as she herself does the scan so you don't have to run between clinic and diagnostic centre for routine scans/sonography . She recommends to get only certain scans done through diagnostic centre which is again completely monitored by her. Also, she is actively there to respond to any of your queries/concerns over whatsapp which again helped us a lot. We were able to conceive naturally under her guidance. I highly recommend her. ",

She has briefed me everything so well about how to conceive & what are other options if person is unable to conceive naturally. She never forced us for any other treatment always insisted us to try naturally. She recommended us to eat homemade food & completely avoid junk food. During my treatment, once she was not available in city, under her guidance we have tried to conceive naturally & the result is i am 3 months pregnant. During my 1 Trimester I have faced morning sickness & leg ache so I have asked her to give some medicines but she never gave any supplements for vitamins & proteins but insisted me to intake from Leafy vegetables, fruits etc.. All credit goes to her.  Very friendly doctor i have ever met. I would recommend her.",

While searching some doctors on Practo I found DR. Shreedevi's profile and saw the reviews which were relatively successful. I just took a chance and went to her. She explained everything in detailed  and started my  treatment. By God's grace with her treatment, injections and medications I have conceived and now I am 1month pregnant.
