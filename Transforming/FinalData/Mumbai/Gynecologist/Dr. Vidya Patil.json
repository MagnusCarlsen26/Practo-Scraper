Entire staff of the hospital is very good. Doctor treated patient very nicely. ****** ****** * ***** ********* ** ***** ****** They always speak politely with their patient. They always inform about the medicines. ***** ********* *** **** ****** ********** They are having a weekly lecture for pregnant women. In that lecture they speak on different topics on pregnancy and they also inform about the different exercises for pregnant women. They are having every equipment with them so you no need to go here and there for test and all. Also like to share that after a birth of my second child they celebrate my daughter's birthday which comes a day after my second child. So, doctor and entire staff is very friendly with their patient and their family too.\nThank you for your support and treatment given to my wife. We are very happy after visiting the clinic.\nWe are wishing you all the best wishes from our end and all the best for the work.\nThank you once again.",

Dr. Vidya kept us informed of our progress all through. With her by our side, we like to think that ours was indeed a normal (caesarean) delivery!\nShe also served as rock-solid support for us, with her crystal clear inputs and logical advice. Our support system on Arya Womens Hospital  was completed by several other special people, including the wonderful nurses; in particular, Sisters Aarti,Jansi, and Pooja.\nOverall, Arya Womens Hospital was a fantastic experience. The fact that all the medical facilities were housed under one roof, right from the pharmacy to the pathology lab, made every consultation smooth. Memorable gestures that will forever be etched in our hearts and minds will be the way she arranged a beautiful decorated cake for us the day after our baby\u2019s birth.\nThank you, Dr.Vidya for running this chain so professionally, yet so personally.Priyanka Verma!!",

They always inform about the medicines. ***** ********* *** **** ****** ********** They are having a weekly lecture for pregnant women. In that lecture they speak on different topics on pregnancy and they also inform about the different exercises for pregnant women. They are having every equipment with them so you no need to go here and there for test and all. Also like to share that after a birth of my second child they celebrate my daughter's birthday which comes a day after my second child. So, doctor and entire staff is very friendly with their patient and their family too.\nThank you for your support and treatment given to my wife. We are very happy after visiting the clinic.\nWe are wishing you all the best wishes from our end and all the best for the work.\nThank you once again.",

Dr. Vidya kept us informed of our progress all through. With her by our side, we like to think that ours was indeed a normal (caesarean) delivery!\nShe also served as rock-solid support for us, with her crystal clear inputs and logical advice. Our support system on Arya Womens Hospital  was completed by several other special people, including the wonderful nurses; in particular, Sisters Aarti,Jansi, and Pooja.\nOverall, Arya Womens Hospital was a fantastic experience. The fact that all the medical facilities were housed under one roof, right from the pharmacy to the pathology lab, made every consultation smooth. Memorable gestures that will forever be etched in our hearts and minds will be the way she arranged a beautiful decorated cake for us the day after our baby\u2019s birth.\nThank you, Dr.Vidya for running this chain so professionally, yet so personally.Priyanka Verma!!",

The paed associated with the dr is great too and I still refer to her. This time I visited for a follow up on the cervical cancer preventive vaccination which was taken care of by the staff. Dr Patil and her staff are excellent at what they do and I highly recommend them ",

If a proper bland diet which was adviced is not followed can cause gastritis which is common and happened to you, since medicines work differently on each individual.\n\nUnfortunately, you did not Followed Up and reverted back for the same even when we asked you to follow up. \n\nPelvic Infection can also cause abseces hydrasalphinx and adhesions in the pelvic which are diagnosed on sonography. This was required to rule out other conditions apart from PID causing pain abdomen.\nAntibiotic induced dirrahorea can happen, for  which you should have shared for follow up.\n \nI feel sad with the type of feedback you have given without following up with  me and I feel you have been instigated unfortunately.\n\n-Dr. Vidya",
