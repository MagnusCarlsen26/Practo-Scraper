I visited Dr Tejaswi on a family doctors suggestion, she was extremely friendly she asked to change my diet and lifestyle and prescribed medicines for three months and it really worked wonders. also the most amazing thing is as I wanted to conceive she was very open in suggesting the ways that will have more chances of me getting pregnant. Exactly after three months I got pregnant and I have been going to her for regular visits but unlike others she doesn\u2019t insist on coming to hospital for everything, she asked me to send my medical reports over Whatsapp and would reply everything as normal. She is affordable and is available over phone whenever I needed her suggestions. Once while my first trimester I had blood clots and she suggested to take Hormonal injections by weekly and prescribed medicines which will keep my progesterone levels balanced which helped me to complete my trimester safely. She gave a lot of info on what to eat what to avoid and how travelling by bus, bikes and auto will be harmful to fetus at early stages. As I live in with my husband alone without parents around her suggestions helped me a lot. I am extremely happy to have her as my doctor during my pregnancy.",

I visited Dr Tejaswi on a family doctors suggestion, she was extremely friendly she asked to change my diet and lifestyle and prescribed medicines for three months and it really worked wonders. also the most amazing thing is as I wanted to conceive she was very open in suggesting the ways that will have more chances of me getting pregnant. Exactly after three months I got pregnant and I have been going to her for regular visits but unlike others she doesn\u2019t insist on coming to hospital for everything, she asked me to send my medical reports over Whatsapp and would reply everything as normal. She is affordable and is available over phone whenever I needed her suggestions. Once while my first trimester I had blood clots and she suggested to take Hormonal injections by weekly and prescribed medicines which will keep my progesterone levels balanced which helped me to complete my trimester safely. She gave a lot of info on what to eat what to avoid and how travelling by bus, bikes and auto will be harmful to fetus at early stages. As I live in with my husband alone without parents around her suggestions helped me a lot. I am extremely happy to have her as my doctor during my pregnancy.",
