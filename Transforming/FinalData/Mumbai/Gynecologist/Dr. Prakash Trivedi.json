He explained the procedure in detail, answered all my questions, and made me feel at ease throughout the entire process. His expertise and calm demeanor were truly reassuring.\n\nThe nursing and support staff were equally commendable. They were attentive, caring, and always available to assist with any needs or concerns. Their dedication to patient care was evident in every interaction, and they went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and well-being.\n\nOne pleasant surprise was the quality of the food. Hospital food often has a poor reputation, but at Trivedi Hospital, the meals were nutritious, well-prepared, and surprisingly delicious. It was clear that thought and care were put into providing balanced and appetizing options for patients.\n\nOverall, my experience at Trivedi Hospital was outstanding. I am grateful for the exceptional care provided by Dr. Prakash Trivedi and the entire staff. I highly recommend this hospital to anyone in need of medical care.",

His expert hands led to safe surgery and completely uneventful post-operative period. Every interaction and discussion was clear and increased our confidence. Besides his professional competency, there was personal touch and involvement, which made the whole experience extremely pleasant. Last, but not the least, the whole staff under him gave timely care to mother and child. My deep regards to Dr Trivedi and his team.",

From the time of my consultation to my surgery and post care recovery stay at the hospital, I was taken care of well by their staff and medical care. Dr. Prakash Trivedi's ********* ********* **** counselling helped me understand the procedure without leaving any doubt on my mind. I'm immensely grateful to Dr. Prakash Trivedi, who is one of the few doctors who make their patients instantly feel relaxed with humble and caring attitude. I can't express enough as to how grateful I am to have come across Dr. Trivedi and Dr. Aditi.\n\n\nI\u00a0would\u00a0also like to thank Dr. Aditi for being available whenever I needed her and answering all my questions patiently with a smiling face during post surgery care. Dr aditi is gem of a person and this can be judged by the way she cares for her patient.\n\n\nI had travelled to Mumbai alone without my parents due to covid19. *** * *** **** ******* ** * **** * *** *** **** ****** ** *****. He made me feel so comfortable and checked on my health throughout my procedure and hospital care.\u00a0\n\n\nI am grateful to Dr. Prakash and his entire team for making it so easy for me to recover. Indeed I truly believe doctors like him with humble and genuine care, and expertise which truly help patients recover\u00a0from their health complications. Under the guidance and care of Dr. Prakash Trivedi and Dr. Aditi and nursing by hospital nursing staff, I have recovered in a very short time, which may not have been possible elsewhere.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nMy earnest review to reflect my medical\u00a0 journey and experience for which I am extremely grateful after having come across Total Care Centre Clinic and the safe hands of Dr Prakash Trivedi. I would highly recommend to family, friends and for all the females who struggle to find the right doctor for correct diagnosis and perfect care. This is\u00a0 one clinic in Mumbai one can trust without any second doubt to go and consult one's medical issues.\u00a0\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Prakash and Dr. Aditi, Hemal and the entire team, and of course the reliable and humble staff who took care of me so well.\u00a0\n\n\nOverall I'm forever grateful and for my best of health in future and concerns Total Women's Health Care Centre is the place to go for.\u00a0\n\n",

He explained the procedure in detail, answered all my questions, and made me feel at ease throughout the entire process. His expertise and calm demeanor were truly reassuring.\n\nThe nursing and support staff were equally commendable. They were attentive, caring, and always available to assist with any needs or concerns. Their dedication to patient care was evident in every interaction, and they went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and well-being.\n\nOne pleasant surprise was the quality of the food. Hospital food often has a poor reputation, but at Trivedi Hospital, the meals were nutritious, well-prepared, and surprisingly delicious. It was clear that thought and care were put into providing balanced and appetizing options for patients.\n\nOverall, my experience at Trivedi Hospital was outstanding. I am grateful for the exceptional care provided by Dr. Prakash Trivedi and the entire staff. I highly recommend this hospital to anyone in need of medical care.",

From the time of my consultation to my surgery and post care recovery stay at the hospital, I was taken care of well by their staff and medical care. Dr. Prakash Trivedi's ********* ********* **** counselling helped me understand the procedure without leaving any doubt on my mind. I'm immensely grateful to Dr. Prakash Trivedi, who is one of the few doctors who make their patients instantly feel relaxed with humble and caring attitude. I can't express enough as to how grateful I am to have come across Dr. Trivedi and Dr. Aditi.\n\n\nI\u00a0would\u00a0also like to thank Dr. Aditi for being available whenever I needed her and answering all my questions patiently with a smiling face during post surgery care. Dr aditi is gem of a person and this can be judged by the way she cares for her patient.\n\n\nI had travelled to Mumbai alone without my parents due to covid19. *** * *** **** ******* ** * **** * *** *** **** ****** ** *****. He made me feel so comfortable and checked on my health throughout my procedure and hospital care.\u00a0\n\n\nI am grateful to Dr. Prakash and his entire team for making it so easy for me to recover. Indeed I truly believe doctors like him with humble and genuine care, and expertise which truly help patients recover\u00a0from their health complications. Under the guidance and care of Dr. Prakash Trivedi and Dr. Aditi and nursing by hospital nursing staff, I have recovered in a very short time, which may not have been possible elsewhere.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nMy earnest review to reflect my medical\u00a0 journey and experience for which I am extremely grateful after having come across Total Care Centre Clinic and the safe hands of Dr Prakash Trivedi. I would highly recommend to family, friends and for all the females who struggle to find the right doctor for correct diagnosis and perfect care. This is\u00a0 one clinic in Mumbai one can trust without any second doubt to go and consult one's medical issues.\u00a0\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Prakash and Dr. Aditi, Hemal and the entire team, and of course the reliable and humble staff who took care of me so well.\u00a0\n\n\nOverall I'm forever grateful and for my best of health in future and concerns Total Women's Health Care Centre is the place to go for.\u00a0\n\n",

Dr. Prakash Trivedi who is a very well know & celebrated Doctor/ Surgeon performed this surgery. Inspite of being so well know, reputed and celebrated doctor, he is a very humble, down to earth, very knowledgeable and a very good listener. Dr. Aditi who was attending to me post operation is also a very knowledgeable and humble person.\n\nHowever, the very first person that we came in contact at the reception was Sonali Nikam. She made us feel completely relaxed and home as soon as we entered the clinic. She is a very helpful, knowledgeable and a person who is willing to go an extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction. Also, another person we met was Hemal who also had the same qualities.\n\nIt would be unfair if I don't mention about the hospital staff - i.e. the  Sisters, Mawshi's and other hospital staff. They all were very attentive, supportive and helpful all the time I stayed at the hospital.\n\nThe food... how can I forget this. Right from morning tea, breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner...It was the most sattvic, delicious , filling and homemade food that I ever had. The attendant who accompanies the patient also is served the same food. We were given to understand that this food comes from doctors home and is the same food what is served to them at their residence.\n\nAll-in-all, a very memorable experience and whenever required, I would highly recommend Dr. Trivedi's Total Health Care to all the Women who are in need for the best doctor and medical care.",

On january 2020 i.had a plan to come to trivedi's total health care for my uterine septum operation but could not do so beacuse of my sudden pregnency. It discontinued very soon. After the lockdown of covid 19 Pandamic, i finally came to.bombay from.Bangladesh to resect my septum. It was around 8.5cm and totally incised it. I also have pco problems. During my lapa\u09e6roscopic surgery, they also drilled on some of the parts of   my overy so that insuline, testtosterone can be produced less and thus my weight can be reduced. I also have to follow a diet routine which has given by them to make it successful. All i want to say that i am very much happy for all the things dr.prakash trivedi and his team have done for me.  I also went to Singapore for  same the issue.  They  did only my vegina septum resection. They could not  do the uterine one because of the complexity of the resection surgery. But sir prakash trivedi has done it \nFully.Thank you to my almighty ALLAH for leading  me the way to dr.prakash trivedi who has a pure soul , amiable behaviour and make my treatement there.",

Everybody around ; right from Dr. Prakash to Dr. Aditi to Hemal at the front desk ; are very helpful. Always approachable and friendly . My mom had to undergo hysterectomy and she was initially a bit concerned. But then on the first visit itself , the way doctors spoke to mom , explained her the problem and the next steps , she felt super confident .  In such cases of surgeries and hospitalization , it is actually the patients confidence and relationship with doctors that helps them recover sooner. And that is something everyone at the clinic ensures. From all the way top to every worker on the ground. Friendly staff , good food and most importantly expert and highly talented  doctors who know their stuff well. Their patience before , during and after the surgery is appreciable. My mom will never forget how doctors took time out to show her and explain to her the post-surgery video. The only drawback is the clinic being a bit old but I was told they are looking to revamp and set-out in to a new hospital soon. That will be great.. Good luck Dr. Trivedi .",

After consulting with Dr. Prakash Trivedi I gained the confidence to go ahead with the laproscopic myomectomy surgery. He gave me a very detailed explanation of the procedure beforehand. I was able to easily fix an appointment date for the surgery with Dr. Prakash Trivedi and within couple of days was back home from the hospital. It is rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for their patient. Would really like to thank Dr. Prakash Trivedi and Dr. Aditi Trivedi for this. \nBoth doctors were very kind and always there to clear any worries of mine. The hospital staff were also very caring and attentive towards me.",

His friendly nature and positivity made me take the decision to get my surgery done only by him.\nWithin 2-3 days we got the surgery done. I stayed for 2 nights at the hospital. The nurses were so helpful and always smiling, didn't feel like i wasn't home. Constant checkups were done by the doctor after the surgery which shows how much they care for their patients. I would definitely recommend Dr.Trivedi for any kind of surgery. Also i would like to add that the food provided within the hospital was very tasty. Lol ! THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH ! ",

I had my hysterectomy done during Covid-19 lockdown and I am extremely grateful to the hospital for the special care they took in such difficult times.\nThe procedure was explained very well and my husband was allowed inside the operation theatre for some time .After the surgery we were shown the video recording of the surgery with detailed  explanations about the procedure thus ensuring total transparency.\n The junior doctors ,especially Dr. Aditi are also very co-operative and cordial. The staff and nurses make you feel at home and are very helpful.A big thank you to the receptionist Mrs Hemal for always accomodating my last minute requests for appointments .  I highly recommend Dr.Trivedi. \nHats off to Dr.Trivedi and his team!",

My meeting with Dr Prakash Trivedi sir, with a ray of hope that I will be back my home within 5 days, fulfilling his commitment and performing the duties with always a cheerful smile on his face.Dr Saumil who had been keen on explaining to me the complete surgery videos, also frequently allowing my family to visit and showing the live surgery is really what my family till date appreciates.\nPre and Post surgery explainations using upgraded technology to the patient,in simple language is the reflection of pure professionalism.\nDr Aditi is always available and her dutiful nature is always visible to everyone.\nAll the staff members are ground to earth, humble in talk including mavshis  and house keeping staff. Quality of food is really nice and they ensure that patient feel like home.Had visited the clinic in terrible pain and was returning home with a smiley face.\nOnce again a big thanks to all the family members of Dr Trivedi's Clinic.",

Thank you is too small a word to describe this family and when I talk about family I include Sister Smita, all the mausis and the warmest receptionist Sonali cannot be missed.\n\nIn this hour of Covid terror we were too scared to come to Mumbai.. but wanted the best treatment for my daughter and as recommended by Dr. Sushila & Dr. Rakesh Khuteta from Jaipur we had come to Mumbai.\n\nI am so happy we made the right decision. The surgery was a bit more complicated than expected but the TEAM has done a flawless, painless & fantastic job.\n\nI can so clearly say this cos 1st time I have ever seen a hospital so open & clear that they showed my daughter & me the video of the complete procedure & explained every detail. Also I was allowed in the operation theatre to see parts of the surgery being done on the 3D Screen.\n\nI can go on writing but truly we feel blessed to be in this TEMPLE as I can call it.\n\nTHANK YOU..LOVE YOU ALL",
