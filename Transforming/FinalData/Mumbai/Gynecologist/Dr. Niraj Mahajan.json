After reading about the medical speciality of Uro-Gynaecology, I consulted Uro-Gynaecologist Dr. Niraj Mahajan. It was indeed a lucky choice! \n       Dr. Mahajan gave me sound medical advice and I finally gained relief. Throughout my interaction with him, he was sensitive, friendly and prompt, always encouraging me to contact him for any query. So positive was my experience that Dr. Mahajan will be my first choice for any uro-gynaec problem hereafter and I can warmly recommend him to friends.",
