I was a bit scared that I might have a C-Sec, but never once did the doctor scared us for a C-Sec. In fact, she always encouraged that it's perfectly normal to have a normal delivery at this age.\nI had a normal delivery mostly because Dr. Sita was so supportive and never during the course of my labour she insisted on a C-Sec. I will strongly recommend Dr. Sita and Godrej Hospital if you are pregnant and looking for a non-fussy pregnancy.\n",

I didn't expected this kind of negative words ...that too during my first visit of pregnancy and instead of trans vaginal sonography she prescribed me blood test where the hcg rise is not up-to the mark and again she terrified me by telling that it might be an ectopic pregnancy because of that I was depressed very much atleast she could have uttered some positive words or she could have not told me the negative things which made me to get depressed at this time of pregnancy. At last i changed doctor done trans vaginal sonography and fetus was inside uterus. ",

I was a bit scared that I might have a C-Sec, but never once did the doctor scared us for a C-Sec. In fact, she always encouraged that it's perfectly normal to have a normal delivery at this age.\nI had a normal delivery mostly because Dr. Sita was so supportive and never during the course of my labour she insisted on a C-Sec. I will strongly recommend Dr. Sita and Godrej Hospital if you are pregnant and looking for a non-fussy pregnancy.\n",

I didn't expected this kind of negative words ...that too during my first visit of pregnancy and instead of trans vaginal sonography she prescribed me blood test where the hcg rise is not up-to the mark and again she terrified me by telling that it might be an ectopic pregnancy because of that I was depressed very much atleast she could have uttered some positive words or she could have not told me the negative things which made me to get depressed at this time of pregnancy. At last i changed doctor done trans vaginal sonography and fetus was inside uterus. ",
