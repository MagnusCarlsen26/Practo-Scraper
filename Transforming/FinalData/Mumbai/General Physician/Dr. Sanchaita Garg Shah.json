Despite that she was insistent that I had gallstones and put me on a strict liquid diet. Coming from a small town the medical facilities are questionable. A week later when things started to feel better I happened to travel to Ahmedabad and ate some regular food. By doing so the pain in my stomach was aggravated and thus she asked me to get another ultrasound. This time the reports were clear as day. I had gallstones along with a collapsed gallbladder and needed surgery immediately. The surgical team was also shocked that I wasn\u2019t in as much pain as expected. It was only due to her constant guidance and care that I survived so many days. She also managed all the communication with the surgical team and kept updated throughout the treatment. Her medical knowledge, bedside manner and diagnosis are par excellence. ",

A week later when things started to feel better I happened to travel to Ahmedabad and ate some regular food. By doing so the pain in my stomach was aggravated and thus she asked me to get another ultrasound. This time the reports were clear as day. I had gallstones along with a collapsed gallbladder and needed surgery immediately. The surgical team was also shocked that I wasn\u2019t in as much pain as expected. It was only due to her constant guidance and care that I survived so many days. She also managed all the communication with the surgical team and kept updated throughout the treatment. Her medical knowledge, bedside manner and diagnosis are par excellence. ",
