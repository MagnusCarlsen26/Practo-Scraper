And along with medicine she gave me lot of comfort with whole lot of conviction that it will get healed in next few days. Her smiling face, her compassion and her ability to make the patient feel comfortable and at home is commendable. I did recover in 5 days as diagnosis was absolutely right!

I struggled first 3 days as doctors couldn\u2019t diagnose the problem until I met Dr Vaijayanti Mahajan who examined me thorough and at the first instance diagnosed it to be Herpeas Zoster and gave me anti viral medication for 5 days. And along with medicine she gave me lot of comfort with whole lot of conviction that it will get healed in next few days. Her smiling face, her compassion and her ability to make the patient feel comfortable and at home is commendable. I did recover in 5 days as diagnosis was absolutely right! Thank you Dr Vaijayanti for such amazing care and cure! More power to you ",
