,,0,0,NO,"Hey, 
I visited the doctor on wednesday, he heard me, he recommended tests. I paid 1200. I got the tests done for about 5500, i showed him the report on friday. Thankfully there was nothing in my report. He saw me for 5 mins and for 5 min checkin 2 days after he charged me 800. I feel the doctor is extremely wrong to do this. Also is kind of rude and impatient. Not recommended. ***** *** **** ****** ******* **********",2022-08-19 15:33:07,False,False,Vibhanshu Jain,,,

,,0,0,NO,Yesterday visited to Dr ravindra hodalkar. I heard about his experience so i went there as i am suffering from kidney stone and need surgery.

Hardly 4questions asked did not told anything. I was not clear wjat i need to do ahead. I would not recommend to this doctor anymore.,2022-05-03 09:50:25,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
,,0,0,NO,Yesterday visited Dr. Hodarkar as recommended by one of our known Doctors. During consultation found this doctor very rude and sarcastic. Agreed he is quite senior but suggestion to him that a polite and friendly behaviour cures a patient faster and builds a confidence within themselves. I don't recommend this doctor to anybody. Let him shine within his wooden cabin with every bit of his arrogance,2021-09-17 11:14:55,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
