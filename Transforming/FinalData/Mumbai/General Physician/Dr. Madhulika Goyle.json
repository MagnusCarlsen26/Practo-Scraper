After learning that it was her fault she told me to cancel Practo booking else Practo will charge as both (I am expecting that I am not been charged for cancellation by Practo) , she insisted & I cancelled my practo booking.\n\n**** **** ****** ******* **** * ******* **** ******* ** ** ******** **** ****** *** **** **************** * ******** **** * ********* ****** ********* *** ***** **** *** ** ******** ** ***** ***** ******* * ******** ** ** **** **** *** ***** *** *** ******** ** *** ***** *** ********* ** **** **** ******* * **** ** *** *** ***** ***** **** * *** ******* *** ******* ** *** *********** ****** ****** * ****** **** * **** ** ****** ** ** *** * **** **** *** **** I have seen no doctor treating their patient this way.
