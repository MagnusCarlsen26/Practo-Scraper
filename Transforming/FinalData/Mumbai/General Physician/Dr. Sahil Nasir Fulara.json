Just six months ago, her weight was around 90 kg, and today, it stands at approximately 66 kg\u2014an impressive testament to her significant improvement.

His diagnosis and treatment has tremendously improved my father\u2019s health.\nUsually conversations with a doc is one sided where the patient listens and follows instructions (sometimes without understanding) but NOT with Dr.Sahil. His patience, warm and jovial nature along with a positive attitude made it very easy to interact with him.\nEven though we have a doctor/patient relationship with him, it\u2019s become a very close one and his periodic follow ups show that he has utmost regard and care for his patients.\nVery rarely do you come across someone like Dr.Sahil and I highly recommend him to everyone.",

Just six months ago, her weight was around 90 kg, and today, it stands at approximately 66 kg\u2014an impressive testament to her significant improvement.

His diagnosis and treatment has tremendously improved my father\u2019s health.\nUsually conversations with a doc is one sided where the patient listens and follows instructions (sometimes without understanding) but NOT with Dr.Sahil. His patience, warm and jovial nature along with a positive attitude made it very easy to interact with him.\nEven though we have a doctor/patient relationship with him, it\u2019s become a very close one and his periodic follow ups show that he has utmost regard and care for his patients.\nVery rarely do you come across someone like Dr.Sahil and I highly recommend him to everyone.",

He started the treatment right on day one. The medicines and the treatment course that he prescribes takes care of the issues very soon. He often speaks to my mom during video consultations and makes her laugh this melts our hearts.  I have consulted top most doctors in Mumbai and Bangalore and can proudly say that he is the best of all.  We are so fortunate that we found him. God bless!",

In order to avoid medication, i self controlled my diet and sugar intake for couple of months. However, i realized that just diet is not the solution, hence consulted Dr Sahil Fulara. Due to lockdown, i opted for video consultancy. Dr Sahil first reviewed all my reports and explained me in details what all issues i was facing which was not restricted to Diabetes. He spent enough time without any hurry and answered all my queries unless i was satisfied. He helped me settle my panic state. \n\nAnd mere 10 days into treatment, my readings are just above normal and im expecting it to be in complete control within a week. ",

I am in the United States now and because of lockdown was not able to make it in time to my India visit and get me medications. He was super supportive and contacted me if I needed the meds couriered. I would highly recommend anyone who is suffering from endocrinological issues etc. to consult with Dr. Fulara. ",

So in November 2019, he arranged a conference call and got me to get an appointment, I told him I am traveling on that particular day when he was having consultations, he insisted and said what time is your flight and arranged a consultation even before his normal timing, and keepin my flight timing in mind. I was so taken a back by this concern, that I made it with all my test and reports etc, only to find out that I really needed to start the treatment, and had I to just postpone it again, I would have made a lot of damage to my thyroid gland, heart and body... Amazing Doctor, I pray and certainly it was Gods will to have a doctor so concerned to come to Goa, all the way from mumbai and take care of his patients.  ",
