The staff members are very very cooperative specially thnx to Jyoti in the OPD section which was on 5th floor. She checked my BP, SPO2, PULSE and ask about my illness. Dr Kiran Mhatre Sir, MBBS, MD came on time and a very polite and calm and ask everything about me. He treated me very well. I was suffering from high fever with cold, CRP Level was too high but he adviced me less medicine and to take exercise. Its a nice pleasure to meet him. I am satisfied with the all team of Shushrut Hospital. I think this hospital doesn't need any recommendations. Already recommended by al of us. ",

Dr Kiran Mhatre Sir, MBBS, MD came on time and a very polite and calm and ask everything about me. He treated me very well.
