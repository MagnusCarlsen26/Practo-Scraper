Apart from his commendable medical expertise and professionalism; he is a great human being who is genuinely concerned with his patient's well being.
Some of his major attributes which most medical fraternity is lacking nowadays;
He is very compassionate and understanding about his patient's condition
He pays individual attention and time for patient's queries and concerns and is extremely kind especially dealing with elderly patients
He keeps in touch through calls and WhatsApp and is extremely prompt in his replies in case of emergency situations (he has taken calls at odd hours multiple times for both my parents)
He has gone out of his way and helped us in finding an ICU bed when it was very difficult to get one.
We wish to thank him for his kind help and may Almighty bless him always.
