,"Heart Conditions,",0,0,NO,"I consulted Doctor Atul Limaye at Fortis Mulund in Sept 22 for the medical treatment for my wife due to chest pain and chest heaviness. The doctor recommended Angiography and refused to prescribe any medicine unless the Angiography was done. Even after requesting him  to prescribe the medicine till the angiography is planned ,he refused to prescribe the medicine and insisted first to do the Angiography in Fortis Mulund and then only he will prescribe the medicine. He is recommending angiography because he is aware that the patient's condition is serious. ** ** *** *** ************** ** ********* *** ********* ********* ** *** ******** **** *** *********** ** ******** * The patient is severely diabitic, ** *** **** ** *********** *** *********** ******* ******** *** ***** ****** He left the patient in such a critical condition without any medication. Does it mean that there is no First Aid medicine till the angiography is planned? ****** *** ********** **** *** ********* ****** **** ***********",2022-09-22 12:23:11,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
