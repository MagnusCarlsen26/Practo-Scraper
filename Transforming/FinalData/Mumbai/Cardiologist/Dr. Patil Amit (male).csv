,"Coronary Angioplasty / Bypass Surgery,Cardiac Diseases,Cardiac Rehabilitation,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Amit Patil is incredible. Not only he has taken great care of my mother in law (Mis. Kausar Jahan Altaf Qureshi) health, but also he is polite to speak with at every appointment. 
He explained everything to me and my family in a very clear manner about my mother in law cardiac issues. *** ********* ********** curiosity, investigative mind and ability to connect, you know where you stand immediately and what next steps look like. Itâ€™s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend.

,,0,0,YES,I had excellent experience with Dr Amit Patil recently when he willingly came over to examine my 92 year old father at his residence as he was unable to walk.  During these Corona virus times this in itself is a great service. Dr Patil responded immediately and spent good amount of time to understand patient's situation.
