"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",,0,0,YES,"I am a senior physiotherapist who has practiced for 43 years in several hospitals across South Mumbai. In this review I would like to summarize my excellent experience with cardiologist, Dr. Ankur Phatarphekar. I have had two consultations with him at his clinic for preoperative consultation on 2D-Echo and ECG tests. The first one was before my laser ablation procedure earlier this year, and for the second time, more recently, prior to my upcoming carpal tunnel surgery.
 
We often hear about fears of patients undergoing cardiac procedures like angioplasty and angiography. I too was apprehensive about my tests, and worried about a dire outcome. Throughout the assessment, the doctor assured me and explained in detail on what to expect. My assessment was thorough and I have been declared fit for surgery next week! Assuring the patient and explaining regarding the conditions, without exaggerating the problems is a critical part of patient care. Dr. Ankur was meticulous in his assessment, with attention to detail and clarity of assessment/ explanation.
 
In spite of having a heavy load of patients, Dr. Ankur was able to give adequate attention to patients, without the quality of treatment being compromised. He is a humble doctor and possesses a calm temperament. My years of experience as a physiotherapist is able to give me a unique perspective in patient care, and I was thoroughly satisfied as a patient at Dr. Ankur’s cardiology clinic. In Mumbai, we surely need cardiologists like Dr. Ankur who keep our hearts healthy and excel in patient care thus leaving a patient feeling assured.
 
To summarize, I give Dr. Ankur P. an “Excellent” in patient care, detailed assessment, perfect diagnosis, correct advice, and a great attitude. I express my gratitude and thankfulness for his time. I wish him all the best in his flourishing career!

"Treatment satisfaction,","Angioplasty and Stenting,",0,0,YES,"I recently had the privilege of having Dr. Ankur Phatarpekar perform an angioplasty on my grandfather, and I must say that I am beyond impressed with his work. My grandfather had three blockages in his heart, and two of them were over 90%, with the other at 80%. He also suffered from kidney failure and was a dialysis patient, which added to the complexity of the situation.Dr. Ankur Phatarpekar was able to manage my grandfather's complicated medical condition and perform a successful angioplasty. He utilized advanced tools that allowed him to use the same thickness of dye for angioplasty as used in angiography. This was remarkable, as it minimized the risk of complications during the procedure while effectively treating my grandfather's condition.Dr. Ankur also took the time to communicate with us clearly and explain the complications of my grandfather beforehand. But it was reassuring to know that he was doing everything he could to ensure that the procedure went smoothly and that my grandfather was comfortable throughout.Overall, I would highly recommend Dr. Ankur to anyone seeking exceptional care and expertise in handling complex cases. He is a exceptional doctor who takes pride in his work, and my family and I are extremely grateful for his help. Thank you, Dr. Ankur Phatarpekar!",2023-04-08 15:05:50,False,True,Manoj rapelli,,,

We researched in detail about hospitals & centres performing TAVI in Mumbai.

However we realised there are only a few Cardiac Sugeons who actually specialize / perform non-invasive heart surgeries, and was most satisfied with the expertise, dedication, care and value of Dr Ankur and his team.

The Valve Clinic at Symbiosis Hospital is a world class set-up with the latest TAVI technology currently available.

I would highly recommend the expertise & care of Dr Ankur & his team to anyone looking at undergoing a TAVI procedure.
