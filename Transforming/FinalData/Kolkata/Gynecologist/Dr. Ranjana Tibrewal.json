Her advice and medication has been extremely beneficial through out the period. Any words of appreciation will be less for the kind of advice, strength and support that she has provided us in all these months. Not only is she an expert in her area but is also very approachable, friendly and patient. She has always been available and responded to all our queries even in the wee hours. She goes an extra mile to understand the problems of her patients and provides the best solution. Our pregnancy wasn't a very smooth one but Dr. Ranjana ensured we were calmed down every time we panicked. Even during the delivery process she was available at all times and ensured that the baby was delivered safely without causing any risk to the mother or the baby. On 16th of October 2020 we were blessed with a baby boy and we are thankful to Dr. Ranjana as it wouldn't have been possible without her support. we would definitely recommend Dr. Ranjana to all the future parents to be.",

Her advice and medication has been extremely beneficial through out the period. Any words of appreciation will be less for the kind of advice, strength and support that she has provided us in all these months. Not only is she an expert in her area but is also very approachable, friendly and patient. She has always been available and responded to all our queries even in the wee hours. She goes an extra mile to understand the problems of her patients and provides the best solution. Our pregnancy wasn't a very smooth one but Dr. Ranjana ensured we were calmed down every time we panicked. Even during the delivery process she was available at all times and ensured that the baby was delivered safely without causing any risk to the mother or the baby. On 16th of October 2020 we were blessed with a baby boy and we are thankful to Dr. Ranjana as it wouldn't have been possible without her support. we would definitely recommend Dr. Ranjana to all the future parents to be.",
