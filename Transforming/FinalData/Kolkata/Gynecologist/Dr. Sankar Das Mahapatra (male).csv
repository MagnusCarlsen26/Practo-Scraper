"Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"He never charges any extra money. I submitted only hospital fees and doctor fees at Neotia Newtown . Everything I submitted in the hospital only. On the other hand, in the year 2021 for my elder daughter delivery   I was under other doctor at Parkstreet neotia He took from me almost 1 lakh separate then sudden  2 days before admission for delivery, they checked and I was covid  positive. As He delivered under covid situation he charged again 1lakh and 20k for covid prevention like  gloves during operation.  These money I didn't paid in the hospital. These all I gave separate to him. Thankfully, in my second issue I changed my doctor to Mahapatra sir and I was really saved. He is so nice doctor and he had saved me! I recommend everyone. He is the best doctor. Surely you will be cured and he never charged any extra money. Even within 15days if you go for checkup after last checkup, he don't charge any fees.",2024-02-11 03:37:45,False,True,Mayurika ,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Maternal Care/ Checkup,",0,0,YES,"Had a wonderful experience with SDM Sir.
To be precise , I had a very complicated pregnancy.
I was under another doctor initially . My reports were not that great and I was told to proceed with termination. I came across SDM Sir and then he guided me with several advance tests which led to confirmation of my pregnancy by 6th month.
His calm and poised nature along with immense patience toward his patients is really commendable. Always available over phone and WhatsApp for any queries during my pregnancy .
I can‚Äôt thank him enough for my delivery of my baby boy.
He is next to God. Highly skilled , super experienced and one of the top senior gynaecologist !!!

Highly highly recommend..",2024-02-11 03:22:37,False,True,Sarina Maitra,,,
