Also after paying Rs1200 for each session of hard earned money it really gives disappointment and dissatisfaction when Doctor does not explain matter clearly rather she feels patient knows the terminologies and it's rootcauses. If we tend to ask more info she feels irritated and shows us her frustration on our face keep telling that so many patients visit her so she cant give time , is this acceptable??My question is if we knew everything, why would we pay to visit you?? Also to highlight she gives extremely less time to discuss with patients on the issues even when you are paying more than 1000 INR of your hard earned money. Feels so wasted !! Utterly disappointed !!",

Also after paying Rs1200 for each session of hard earned money it really gives disappointment and dissatisfaction when Doctor does not explain matter clearly rather she feels patient knows the terminologies and it's rootcauses. If we tend to ask more info she feels irritated and shows us her frustration on our face keep telling that so many patients visit her so she cant give time , is this acceptable??My question is if we knew everything, why would we pay to visit you?? Also to highlight she gives extremely less time to discuss with patients on the issues even when you are paying more than 1000 INR of your hard earned money. Feels so wasted !! Utterly disappointed !!",
