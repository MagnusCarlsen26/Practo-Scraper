The first two trimesters had gone well and baby\"s overall growth was good. From the late 2nd trimester I was diagnosed with elevated liver enzymes and high blood pressure. The doctor himself arranged  consultation with a gastroenterologist . In 32 weeks I was diagnosed with chicken pox. After that the doctor had himself contacted for emergency admission to AMRI Mukundapur hospital and with his and the team\"s frequent effort I was able to deliver a baby boy . After the C section , I was facing many problems like vomiting , pain . Dr Guha had given importance to each and every problem and tried to solve as soon as possible. Now after 1 week of delivery I am completely healthy and I am not facing any health issues. The early recovery was only possible for Dr Guha\"s valuable advice and prompt action . ",

He is fully cooperative all the time during pregnancy and he is very soft spoken and he hears all the problems very minutely and solve those in a very ease way like as he also does in delivery time. So we must say that his cooperation is greatly solicited. I must say may God gift him a long life so that he can save others like us. Thank you. ",

The doctor himself arranged  consultation with a gastroenterologist . In 32 weeks I was diagnosed with chicken pox. After that the doctor had himself contacted for emergency admission to AMRI Mukundapur hospital and with his and the team\"s frequent effort I was able to deliver a baby boy . After the C section , I was facing many problems like vomiting , pain . Dr Guha had given importance to each and every problem and tried to solve as soon as possible. Now after 1 week of delivery I am completely healthy and I am not facing any health issues. The early recovery was only possible for Dr Guha\"s valuable advice and prompt action . ",
