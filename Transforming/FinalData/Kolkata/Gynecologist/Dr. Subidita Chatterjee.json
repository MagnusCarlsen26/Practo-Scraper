We were facing difficulties for the same, and contacted a few other doctors before her, though nothing fruitful happened. Then someone suggested her name and we visited her clinic in Salt Lake. It was a wonderful journey and experience throughout the process. She is very humble and polite throughout the process. She explained every major and minor issues we faced with proper reasoning. She takes more time to observe or see a patient than others (own experiences only). Always gave hope during the process. Even her support staffs are extremely helpful and organised. They will help you a lot during the process too. I would say it's a blessing from God almighty and Mrs. Chatterjee towards me and my wife that we came across to her during our tough times, and were blessed with a baby girl in November 2022. She's more than a doctor for us and we will always be grateful  towards her throughout our lifetime.God Bless Everyone \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\ude4f",

She never entertain any call even in case of emergency also. On last occasion when my husband went to the clinic to show my test report, they have asked him to give consultation fee. When he asked them why they are asking for consultation fee as he only went to show my test reports within four days of our last consultation, they were saying as Dr. has given her consultation time thus he need to pay. Although initially they have told us that we don't have to pay anything if we come for any revisit within 7 days. Later doctor message me that I need not to come again and suggest me to go to govt hospital where I will get treatment for free. I was forced to change the doctor although I was 3-4 month pregnant that time. I will suggest everyone please think twice ****** *** ****** **** ****** *** **** ***** ****  ",

Doctor mam thoroughly and patiently listened to all the issues that my mother had to share. She gave adequate time to diagnose my mother. Checked for all possibilities to find the root cause of the pain. She explained each and everything in a very detailed manner to me and my mother.But unfortunately, the root cause of the suffering that my mother is experiencing has not yet been detected. Both the Gynaecologist and the Urologist have been trying their best and have conducted various tests and surprisingly the reports of all the tests appear cent percent normal making it even more difficult to address the issue.Above all, I'm very thankful to Doctor mam for her expertise and experience which she shared with us and we also highly appreciate her and thank her for not misguiding us with any false treatment and etc. Thank You Doctor Mam !!!

However, after consulting her, I was relieved and happy.\nThere are so many things, which I appreciate about her and her clinic. First, I've visited some big hospitals also in the recent past, but I must say, at her clinic, the safety protocols against Covid were much better than some very reputed hospitals. From sanitization to masks, they followed all protocols. I felt safe the moment I stepped in.\nSecond, her clinic has all equipment and so unlike hospitals, you don't need to rush from one counter to other for reports. She instantly diagnoses your problem.\nThird, she never pushes you with extra medicines, tests or procedures. She does what is deemed best. \nLast, she gives ample time, doesn't judge or discriminate.\nI've recently started her treatment and hope the meds will do its work.\nSo please don't suffer in silence and visit her if you have some issues.  \n",

And then there are doctors who not only are adept at the technicalities of the medical profession, but also know how to operate from the heart and can heal a patient solely via compassion and empathy... Dr. Subidita is a prime example of that... She is very well blessed with the art of listening to a patient, and that is where half the problem gets solved at the very outset... I feel extremely grateful and lucky to have found her, and to have gotten rid of a gynaecological problem that had been plaguing me for the last 20 odd years... I will not go into the details of my suffering, but would simply say that it was a complicated one, and that no other doctor had been able to either diagnose it correctly, leave apart getting a remedy to it... But Subidita didi did so, *** * **** **** ***** ***** ** *** ******* ****** I would very strongly recommend her to all the women out there who want their sensitivity and dignity to be respected while getting cured at the same time...",

The staffs are also very good.there is a smooth process before meeting the doctor.  your weight, pressure everything is taken down. i just had one problem. i was asked to do a blood test. A woman in her fifties came to take the blood. she was not gentle and it hurt quite a bit. when i asked her to be a little gentle, she said that she is doing all these for quite a long time. I went back home and a bruise formed in that area, a big one in fact. i was scared to death. i thought she might have used a syringe which has been used before. After that  i remember her carrying a new packet of syringe while she was entering and also my husband googled, probably the vein was hurt while taking out the blood.  Please ask her to be a little more gentle, she claimed that she had many experience but it didnt seem so. Also, the place is bit too expensive, which is justified by the services provided.\nApart from this little thing, everything is just perfect. the Doctor is too good and the best part is she listens the whole thing before jumping into conclusions unlike many other doctors. I have visited many gynae before in kolkata, *** *** ** *** ** *** ***** ** ****** if you are having problems and thinking about taking an appointment with her, please do. worth the money. She is really very good. And ma'am i would request you to kindly convey my message to that lady. Sorry for giving a late review.\n",

We were facing difficulties for the same, and contacted a few other doctors before her, though nothing fruitful happened. Then someone suggested her name and we visited her clinic in Salt Lake. It was a wonderful journey and experience throughout the process. She is very humble and polite throughout the process. She explained every major and minor issues we faced with proper reasoning. She takes more time to observe or see a patient than others (own experiences only). Always gave hope during the process. Even her support staffs are extremely helpful and organised. They will help you a lot during the process too. I would say it's a blessing from God almighty and Mrs. Chatterjee towards me and my wife that we came across to her during our tough times, and were blessed with a baby girl in November 2022. She's more than a doctor for us and we will always be grateful  towards her throughout our lifetime.God Bless Everyone \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\ude4f",

We only charge 50 % if the report shows a problem and  I have to spend a lot of time on explaining and the patient needs a new prescription. I always answer whatsapp messages and always hold emergency calls even in the middle of the night.We would have loved to see patients for free and done all reporting for free if we had a subsidy but unfortunately we are private sector. So please understand our situation.  In the future we are about to start a low cost service at our hospital.\nGod bless you Mousumi.

She never entertain any call even in case of emergency also. On last occasion when my husband went to the clinic to show my test report, they have asked him to give consultation fee. When he asked them why they are asking for consultation fee as he only went to show my test reports within four days of our last consultation, they were saying as Dr. has given her consultation time thus he need to pay. Although initially they have told us that we don't have to pay anything if we come for any revisit within 7 days. Later doctor message me that I need not to come again and suggest me to go to govt hospital where I will get treatment for free. I was forced to change the doctor although I was 3-4 month pregnant that time. I will suggest everyone please think twice ****** *** ****** **** ****** *** **** ***** ****  ",

Doctor mam thoroughly and patiently listened to all the issues that my mother had to share. She gave adequate time to diagnose my mother. Checked for all possibilities to find the root cause of the pain. She explained each and everything in a very detailed manner to me and my mother.But unfortunately, the root cause of the suffering that my mother is experiencing has not yet been detected. Both the Gynaecologist and the Urologist have been trying their best and have conducted various tests and surprisingly the reports of all the tests appear cent percent normal making it even more difficult to address the issue.Above all, I'm very thankful to Doctor mam for her expertise and experience which she shared with us and we also highly appreciate her and thank her for not misguiding us with any false treatment and etc. Thank You Doctor Mam !!!

First, I've visited some big hospitals also in the recent past, but I must say, at her clinic, the safety protocols against Covid were much better than some very reputed hospitals. From sanitization to masks, they followed all protocols. I felt safe the moment I stepped in.\nSecond, her clinic has all equipment and so unlike hospitals, you don't need to rush from one counter to other for reports. She instantly diagnoses your problem.\nThird, she never pushes you with extra medicines, tests or procedures. She does what is deemed best. \nLast, she gives ample time, doesn't judge or discriminate.\nI've recently started her treatment and hope the meds will do its work.\nSo please don't suffer in silence and visit her if you have some issues.  \n",

Dr. Subidita is a prime example of that... She is very well blessed with the art of listening to a patient, and that is where half the problem gets solved at the very outset... I feel extremely grateful and lucky to have found her, and to have gotten rid of a gynaecological problem that had been plaguing me for the last 20 odd years... I will not go into the details of my suffering, but would simply say that it was a complicated one, and that no other doctor had been able to either diagnose it correctly, leave apart getting a remedy to it...

The staffs are also very good.there is a smooth process before meeting the doctor.  your weight, pressure everything is taken down. i just had one problem. i was asked to do a blood test. A woman in her fifties came to take the blood. she was not gentle and it hurt quite a bit. when i asked her to be a little gentle, she said that she is doing all these for quite a long time. I went back home and a bruise formed in that area, a big one in fact. i was scared to death. i thought she might have used a syringe which has been used before. After that  i remember her carrying a new packet of syringe while she was entering and also my husband googled, probably the vein was hurt while taking out the blood.  Please ask her to be a little more gentle, she claimed that she had many experience but it didnt seem so. Also, the place is bit too expensive, which is justified by the services provided.\nApart from this little thing, everything is just perfect. the Doctor is too good and the best part is she listens the whole thing before jumping into conclusions unlike many other doctors. I have visited many gynae before in kolkata, *** *** ** *** ** *** ***** ** ****** if you are having problems and thinking about taking an appointment with her, please do. worth the money. She is really very good. And ma'am i would request you to kindly convey my message to that lady. Sorry for giving a late review.\n",

So I might have appeared rushed but I love my patients and most of them trust me and love me back. I thought you were one of them too.... you are welcome to come back if you realize...\nI asked my staff about what you said about them.

I don\u2019t think I will go back to her because of this cold behaviour I got from her today. I will have to go and visit someone else after wasting 1 week.",

As I conceived in some other country, getting a doctor at the last moment after my relocation in India was a worry. However the video consultation went so good that We had no doubts that we found our doctor. She was extremely patient with all kinds of questions. After coming back to India, our first face to face consultation went equally well. She gives time to her patients and thats the quality we loved the most! We tried for a normal delivery till the last and never once was she negative regarding our wish. However because of the child\u2019s position till 39 weeks we had to opt for c-section and that too, went extremely well. I have a healthy baby with me and all thanks to her for consulting me at the last moment and for being so patient.",

My husband and I feel very comfortable talking to her, just like we would with an elder sister/mother. Thank you for always being patient with us and providing us the right treatment, dear doctor.

Maybe I was trying to exclude a serious condition. This is private sector so anything we do costs money you know. Also cysts are of many types. There is something called physiological cyst which goes away without treatment but of course treatment helps. Then there are hemorrhagic cysts and so may other types exist. Please do not demean a good and serious doctor. This attitude will constrict us in treating our best. Anyways stay blessed. I just feel sad thats all.",

She is a motherly figure to me always. I could always get in touch with her over phone or whatsapp. Another very important thing, she refrained from doing USG as less as possible and did it only when necessary. \nAll the members of Body N Clinic are always very helpful and very approachable.

So what can I say? i checked my notes. I also gave the necessary medicines  to combat this problem on whatsapp. Your partner called me almost everyday. in the end we resolved the issue as i see from my records. Please learn to trust a qualified doctor. I do hope and trust eventually you will be fine. Take care.

Every thing can be done within just one visit.i was really impressed with that. \n Before divulging into the next part, it's better if I clear up a few things. I suffer from hyper anxiety and I get panic attacks quite frequently.  This morning I also went through one. I did a transvaginal ultrasound, and she did it very meticulously with proper protection and everything. Somewhere, today ,I read an article about cross contamination through TVS and immediately I had a panic attack. I called her up. She listened patiently. She assured me that it is impossible to contract any infection because the instrument there is properly sterilized after each examination. And she had used all sorts of protection, taken my consent before going through with the examination. She assured me that everything is fine. What I found so thoughtful was she even asked me that if I am having any infection or not,  which I am NOT ,nothing. It was just my anxiety. I am so pleased that she paid heed to my paranoia which any other doctor would have found bothering and I was assured that the procedure was completely safe and there is no risk of such cross contamination. I feel much better now...I highly reccomend her. And I am glad that such caring doctors exist in our city. Thanks a lot ma'am.you are the best.\u2764",

Unlike other doctors who  are very professional and spend only few mins for your check up,she takes time to discuss about your health concerns. Quite Cooperative, Interactive and friendly by nature to make patients comfortable and open -up.Best part is to get online appointment where you can choose your slot as per your ease and you don't have to wait long in the queue. Also in case of need, you can communicate with her via call,mail,Skype and even WhatsApp. And last but not the least,her set up 'Body n Mind' is really good and a single step solution for a healthy body and happy mind with facilities like gym,health cafe,body massage ,hobby centre and library.\r\n\r\n",

But then we ask the patients to do a beta HCG blood test which can detect pregnancy even at 2 or 3 weeks.\nSo it is unlikely that I did not ask you to do the blood test or even ask you to come after 2 weeks to confirm.\nI would have said that if it is confirmed only them your take the medicine.\nto get your periods.\nYou dont listen to the doctor and then blame them, This is unfair.\nAnyways stay blessed and hope you understand how compassionate a doctor I am  in due course.\nTake care and stay blessed.",

Her behaviour is very polite, very decent. She listen my each and every word very carefully and advice what to do not only as a doctor, but also as a careing mother. Till date I have not found any professional attitude by her. Few days back I felt some problems regarding my pregnancy, I called her, she immediately attained my call and told me to immediately visit the clinic. Though there were many pre appointed patients, she called me first and have done everything whatever was necessary for me, even she has not charged a single rupee as her consultation fees or USG fees. I am really thankful to her. Not even the doctor, the behaviour of the other members of the clinic are also very polite and helpful.",
