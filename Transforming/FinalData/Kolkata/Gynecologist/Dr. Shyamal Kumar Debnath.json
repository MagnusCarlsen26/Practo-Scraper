Through his treatment over a few months I had conceived with my twin baby boys. My pregnancy was also a roller coaster journey with a couple of emergency visits and a hospitalisation prior to delivery. Dr. Debnath was always available on phone to listen to the issues and provides immediate remedies. Finally he did my c-section surgery with best possible care and visited me a couple times after the delivery to make sure I am healing well and babies are doing well too. Myself and my husband are ever indebted to him and we recommend him strongly for any gynaecological consultancies.",

Lastly sir called me and told me that now I think I would like to do the laproscopy to see the falopian tube bcz of any problem in it. I Was scared  and ran into the shymal sir's room and told him that plz sir I don't want to do this plz do something. Then he adviced me to take one medicine name OVARIES plus. And it is fortunately worked. And the 2nd month when I was going for a test and the report was  I m pregnant. I am really very grateful to him and thank him all the time not only for it but also he is a very very good surgeon. His way of surgery is also very good. I will always refer him.

Dr. Debnath was always available on phone to listen to the issues and provides immediate remedies. Finally he did my c-section surgery with best possible care and visited me a couple times after the delivery to make sure I am healing well and babies are doing well too. Myself and my husband are ever indebted to him and we recommend him strongly for any gynaecological consultancies.",
