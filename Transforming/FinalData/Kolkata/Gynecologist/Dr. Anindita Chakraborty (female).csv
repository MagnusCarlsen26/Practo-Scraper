"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,**** **** ****** *** very good behaviour. During the whole pregnancy period of my wife she guided us like a senior family member and till end time provided her support. Whenever we called her over phone she picked up and replied. Over whatsapp also she responded to our all queries. Whatever we can say in her appreciation will be very less. Just speechless in her treatment and overall very nice. At a scale of 10 will provide 10. Would also recommend others to visit her and whatever issue you have just ask the doctor she will show you the correct path.
