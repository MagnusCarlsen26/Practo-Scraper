We were in helpless then. Suddenly one of my colleague has advised me that I may visit Dr. Irina Dey. I was not sure, but the very first time we visited her, the way she has advised, taken away all our tension. We have followed her advice completely. \nHowever with the final scan on 33rd week, some complications were observed and that was the second bump. We were into mental trauma but again, Dr. Dey has taken more than half an hour to speak to us and helped us with all the necessary advice, which has boosted our experience. She gave best of the medicines and clarified all our doubts. In next 4 weeks, the complication has disappeared and I became a proud father of a healthy baby.\n\nI would be always thankful to Dr. Dey for her extraordinary support.",

We were planning for a baby & Doc started the treatment in that direction. The journey of last 1 year (almost) was fabulous to say the least. The doc was too much caring & precautious in each & every step. She is confident, very friendly, has complete foresight of what she is doing & why she is doing. She communicates & explains each & everything to us. She would earn some extra brownie points for her protectiveness. She is so much caring that sometimes you feel like you are consulting your friend /relative who's also a doctor. That is very rare in today's time. We are blessed with a baby girl under her supervision at AMRI Dhakuria last week in these hard times of Covid pandemic. However, the consultation doesn't end here. She is doing the follow up checkups that would last for one more year. Let me tell you once again that, Doc. Dey is the best doctor you can consult. Meeting her was possibly the second best thing that happened to us (the birth of our child being the obvious first) during the pregnancy planning. I would recommend everyone to consult the Doc. Be rest assured you'd be in safe hands.",

Doctor had been very supportive and cooperative with patient and family throughout the process, both pre and post operative care.

I was not sure, but the very first time we visited her, the way she has advised, taken away all our tension. We have followed her advice completely. \nHowever with the final scan on 33rd week, some complications were observed and that was the second bump. We were into mental trauma but again, Dr. Dey has taken more than half an hour to speak to us and helped us with all the necessary advice, which has boosted our experience. She gave best of the medicines and clarified all our doubts. In next 4 weeks, the complication has disappeared and I became a proud father of a healthy baby.\n\nI would be always thankful to Dr. Dey for her extraordinary support.",

We were planning for a baby & Doc started the treatment in that direction. The journey of last 1 year (almost) was fabulous to say the least. The doc was too much caring & precautious in each & every step. She is confident, very friendly, has complete foresight of what she is doing & why she is doing. She communicates & explains each & everything to us. She would earn some extra brownie points for her protectiveness. She is so much caring that sometimes you feel like you are consulting your friend /relative who's also a doctor. That is very rare in today's time. We are blessed with a baby girl under her supervision at AMRI Dhakuria last week in these hard times of Covid pandemic. However, the consultation doesn't end here. She is doing the follow up checkups that would last for one more year. Let me tell you once again that, Doc. Dey is the best doctor you can consult. Meeting her was possibly the second best thing that happened to us (the birth of our child being the obvious first) during the pregnancy planning. I would recommend everyone to consult the Doc.

In the meantime I was diagnosed with ovarian cyst and she suggested me for the immediate OT. I was very scared because of the post complications and about recovery duration but trust me after exactly 1 week of OT I'm writing this, here I am with very mild pain in my stomach and facing zero problems in walking and doing almost any activity.  It doesn't seem like I underwent a surgery few days back.  I am so happy with her overall treatment, even after post treatment the way she kept the record of my health is so overwhelming.  I would highly recommend her to anybody for any gynecological treatment. ",

And on top of it ,if you need a friend whom you can openly talk at the time of pregnancy/any gynaecology issue, you can go to her. \nI\u2019ve visited for pregnancy planning. Doctor is extremely well spoken and listens to the problem and gives solution. She is very positive which helps the me to be confident. She is always reachable over phone for any queries. I delivered a baby boy under her treatment.\nAlso she support me for my postpartum journey still under her observation for a healthy future.\nPeople can reach her @ AMRI Dhakuria and Serum Analysis Center Gariahat.",

                "review_text": "Well! To start with, we had an accident in 2017.\nAnd then, we got a positive slide, and we were confused where to go as the last Doctor was a total mistake. Then we Googled, and found her. We read the reviews, and took a chance, A BIG chance with Dr. Irina Dey. And to our surprise, we were blessed to get a Doctor like her. Every step, every confusion, every anxiety, she worked like a God and we were sure after 2 visits that, we chose the right one. Today our Baby Girl is 21 days old, and I can bet my career that without her involvement, guidance and meticulous approach things would have gone awry. She not just guides her patients but takes double precaution and stress to ensure the mother and baby both are fine. During our pregnancy, she was always available, text, call and she\u2019s there to respond. We were stressed at times, but her confidence of operating the issues were so calm that we had a blind faith on her and her prescriptions. We are blessed today, not just with our daughter but also because we had Dr. Irina Dey with us, all the way. She\u2019s more like your friend, from whom you can always seek advice without hesitation.\nWe would rate her 15/10 if that\u2019s possible. God has shown us the right path, and she was the medium.\nI don\u2019t know if there are far better doctors here in Kolkata, but she\u2019s one you can always reach out to. Thumbs up & Kudos to her.",
