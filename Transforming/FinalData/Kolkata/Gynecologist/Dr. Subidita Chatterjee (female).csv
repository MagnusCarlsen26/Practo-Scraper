Please do come back and help me change your opinion of me and understand what I do. I never make patients pay unnecessarily. Maybe I was trying to exclude a serious condition. This is private sector so anything we do costs money you know. Also cysts are of many types. There is something called physiological cyst which goes away without treatment but of course treatment helps. Then there are hemorrhagic cysts and so may other types exist.

I did a transvaginal ultrasound, and she did it very meticulously with proper protection and everything. Somewhere, today ,I read an article about cross contamination through TVS and immediately I had a panic attack. I called her up. She listened patiently. She assured me that it is impossible to contract any infection because the instrument there is properly sterilized after each examination. And she had used all sorts of protection, taken my consent before going through with the examination. She assured me that everything is fine. What I found so thoughtful was she even asked me that if I am having any infection or not,  which I am NOT ,nothing. It was just my anxiety. I am so pleased that she paid heed to my paranoia which any other doctor would have found bothering and I was assured that the procedure was completely safe and there is no risk of such cross contamination.

So it is unlikely that I did not ask you to do the blood test or even ask you to come after 2 weeks to confirm.
