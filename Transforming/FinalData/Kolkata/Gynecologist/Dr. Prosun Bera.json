More than a doctor he went ahead and supported us and we were blessed with a baby daughter. I really have no words to thank Dr. Bera. If you are facing any issues with fertility please visit Sir and I am sure you will echo the same. While the center can have their corporate culture, doctor plays a very crucial part in your treatment, empathizing you and also guiding you on the financial side. ** ** *** **** ** *** *** ******* Thank you Sir for helping us with this wonderful gift.... Parenting! ",
