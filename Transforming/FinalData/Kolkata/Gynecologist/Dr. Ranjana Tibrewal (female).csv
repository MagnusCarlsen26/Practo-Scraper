Not only is she an expert in her area but is also very approachable, friendly and patient. She has always been available and responded to all our queries even in the wee hours. She goes an extra mile to understand the problems of her patients and provides the best solution. Our pregnancy wasn't a very smooth one but Dr. Ranjana ensured we were calmed down every time we panicked. Even during the delivery process she was available at all times and ensured that the baby was delivered safely without causing any risk to the mother or the baby.

With inconsistent symptoms  which are open to many causes, blind prescription of medication online is NOT allowed. 
Patients need to understand that Online Consultation is NOT  SUBSTITUTE to chamber consultation and clinical examination  is  sometimes an essential prerequisite to  prescribing medicines. Moreover, prescribing any ointment based on vague symptoms is NOT GOOD OR ETHICAL PRACTICE. 
Hence the patient comment on a doctor's experience or confidence without proper knowledge of the subject shows her immaturity.
