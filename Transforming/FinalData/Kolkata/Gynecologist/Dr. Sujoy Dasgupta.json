We tried for IVF-ICSI which failed for the first time, but we never lost hope on the doctor. We attempted for IVF again under him and on 6th Nov 2023, we were blessed with a baby boy.\n\nWe started the treatment under Dr. Dasgupta during the starting of 2022. He shared the pros and cons of all treatment procedures and presented us the choices for IUI and IVF. His detailed information, especially considering my advanced maternal age, helped us to opt for IVF. He also shared a book authored by him regarding details of IVF pregnancy during the visit which clarified almost all the doubts and any questions that we had.\n\nThe second IVF attempt was progressing smoothly till ovum pickup. We were planning to freeze the embryo and plan for pregnancy later, but doctor suggested for immediate Embryo Transfer within 3 days of pickup, considering the quality of the embryo and the history of the failure of embryo formation during the first attempt. Despite the sudden pregnancy decision was hard to take still we decided to trust him. The pregnancy progressed smoothly till 3rd trimester, although low PAPP-A was detected in NT scan (signifying the growth restriction of placenta). The baby was detected with late onset IUGR in the early 3rd trimester. My son was even not required to be admitted in NICU and stayed with me throughout the hospitalization.\n\nHe is a patient centric doctor who also considers the financial aspects of his patients, which proved to be more helpful to us as we are from a middle class background. Throughout the journey, he explained the pros and cons of most of the medicines and the treatment transparently, never hiding any facts.\n\nThank you sir for your priceless consultations and guidances. Our dream has come true after long years of struggle.",

Nobody can understand the level of stress an Infertile Couple is going through, especially after repeated attempts of treatment and failure. Unfortunately no treatment can give guarantee of success. But following proper steps and understanding the problem, majority conceive eventually. \nWe believe that it's only the couple who can decide the mode of treatment- natural conception, IUI or IVF. Our duty is to discuss with them different options with merits, demerits, success rates, risks, cost of each option. This is very much pertinent because the struggling couples are fully relying on us. \nThank you for giving us the opportunity to treat you and make you smile after a long run battle. ",

After the the first visit we came back with a new hope and our depressions left aside after his counselling regarding infertility. Then we started treatment under his supervision and we realised that things are getting better for us day by day and our depression converted in to a positive energy which was only due to his positive counselling and proper treatment to exact root cause. He is patience enough and also kept us patient throughout the treatment. He is expert enough to diagnose infertility issues and propose right treatment to get results. This how we were continuing under his treatment and to our utter surprise one fine morning we got the good news in a very natural way (without any artificial procedures) and we broke in to tears that time and immediately shared the good news with him and then after my wife's entire pregnancy term was strictly and carefully managed by him and on 11thMay2019 we became a proud and happy parent of beautiful baby girl \ud83d\udc67 and started our journey of parenthood. One more thing I would like to share that I haven't seen such expert doctor with such simplicity friendly, understanding and carring behaviour never in my life. Also telephonic support any time if required. \n\nMany thanks to Dr. Sujoy Dasgupta for everything we wish you success for all your endeavours and keep bringing smiles to couples suffering infertility issues. May God bless you and keep you in good health for keeping up the good work. ",

He does not prescribe useless medicines and never asks for unnecessary testings. We were married for 3 years but never enjoyed our conjugal life due to erectile dysfunction of my hubby. He consulted many doctors but all were in vain. Finally when we planned to have a baby, it was found that I had PCOS problems. Many doctors prescribed numerous tests and medicines but nothing worked. Even somebody advised us test tube baby. Nobody addressed our issue properly. So we lost all hopes to conceive naturally. We consulted Dr Dasgupta at his Garia chamber as a last chance. On first consultation he discussed many issues giving us almost 45 minutes time. He prescribed drugs and some exercises to my husband, which worked like magic within few days. His performance improved a lot. He advised me few tests and gave much emphasis on weight loss (which nobody advised before). He said \"I am not God. I cannot give you guarantee. But I can try my level best to make you smile. But I do not give false assurance\". He kept his promises. By God's grace we conceived naturally within 3 months of his consultation. That time he was also beside us. Throughout my pregnancy, whenever I felt any problem I gave his a ring, even if it was midnight. he never felt disturbed and talked to me in gentle way. Even he checked me out of his chamber timing. Finally my baby boy was delivered by him on January 2016 in a midnight (that was also an emergency).... I can never pay his debts. We are now enjoying parenthood as well as conjugal life, only because of him.",

Impressed with such positive reviews and academic excellence of the doctor, we visited him with the intent to conceive. First visit was highly satisfying. Doctor explained everything beautifully and suggested to see him after a few months. On trying for 6-8 months without result, he made necessary prognosis, diagnosis, lab tests and everything came all right. He prescribed a medicine (Ovulation Induction method) and we conceived within 2-3 months. We became joyous at this and without a second thought we kept consulting him throughout the pregnancy period. Sir was extremely patient friendly, and caring. Interaction with Sir has always removed our stress/ worries and filled with positivity and confidence. He never prescribed excess medicines or tests. We followed his advices meticulously throughout the period. He never bothered to reply to our messages whenever we needed to discuss. \nThe best thing we found in Sir is his paying sincere attention to his patients, and explaining the potential risks, possible benefits and remedies. We had some complications like Hypothyroidism, Obstetrics Cholestasis during the period. However, those were medically managed by Sir and everything came out to our expectations. We are blessed with a healthy baby boy two days back at RSV hospital in the ****** ******* *** seasoned hands of Doctor Dasgupta. We are extremely indebted to you Sir for giving the best gift (lifeline) of our lives. Not only the surgery was really painless as felt by my wife, the entire journey has been hassle-free. The goodness and bounty seen in Sir is really rare nowadays and we are extremely fortunate to have received the same. We once again profusely thank you sir for everything. Pray you reach to the zenith of success. My sincere thanks also to the folks who shared their beautiful experiences about Sir and helped us to know about him. From our experience, we can proclaim without hesitations that *** ** *** ** *** **** obstetricians & gynaecologists & infertility experts whom one can rely upon blindly.

Moreover, scientifically, a single semen analysis is not at all reliable and no treatment can be done based on a single semen analysis. Therefore, it is always advisable to do semen analysis from infertility laboratory to confirm whether it is actually good or bad. Many times we have seen the second semen analysis report is completely different. \nIn any infertility clinic of the World, both husband and wife need to come together. Even if there is problem in husband's sperm only, the wife need to be seen by the infertility specialist who will discuss the treatment ONLY after seeing reports of both. In our centre, the charge Rs 1200 includes \n1. Consultation charges for both husband and wife \n2. Psychological counseling, which is mandatory for any infertility clinic as per Govt of India \n3. TVS ultrasound for wife.\nYou paid the charge and we offered you all these but you refused treatment and any test for your wife.\nYou wanted to act very smart and you thought only your report will be checked. Medicine practice has its rule and you can NOT change the way of treatment. We requested you to do evaluation of your wife which would have been done without spending anything extra. But you refused that. You repeatedly insisted on medicines. Before giving any medicine we need to see whether medicine is actually needed. But you were very much stubborn and you thought you know everything of infertility treatment. \nWe are thankful that our patients rely completely on us when they come to our clinic. \nI will advise you to write a book on infertility treatment where you can dictate how treatment should be done. Good luck.",

Nobody can judge the prescription of another doctor. We can not comment on tests advised by other doctors.\nEven finally he requested that he was having an emergency (because we cannot endanger other patient's life when that patient requires URGENT medical attention). But you repeatedly asked to know the SPELLING OF EACH TEST advised by the doctor. The tests were clearly written in prescription and it did not require the doctor to spell the name of each test.\nTherefore in future when you visit any doctor, please remember,\n1) all patients may not get equal time in consultation. The time depends on the severity of the problem patient is suffering.\n2) don't compete with other patients regarding time\n3) don't ask the doctor to judge the prescription of another doctor. (You purposefully avoided explanation of this).\n4) the spelling of the tests can be asked from the laboratory.\nGood luck.",

We believe that the patients have the right to take decision about their treatment and therefore, they should be fully informed about the details of their condition, reports and treatment options. Thank you for your unconditional faith on us from the very beginning.\nRegarding Covid 19 pandemic, it was totally unexpected. We never anticipated such things. That's why we have not been able to provide the care according to our standard protocol. We have to omit many check up, tests and medicines just to avoid spreading the infection according to the Govt policy. We feel this is very tough time, especially for those who are pregnant and their family members. We are trying our best to support them via phone and Whatsapp.\nThank you again for your kind words of appreciation.",

Since my husband used to work out of West Bengal,  we could not start the treatment immediately and visited Dr after few months with the results of the tests once my husband shifted to Kolkata exclusively for the purpose of my treatment. \n\nBased on the reports of the tests advised by Dr Dasgupta, he suggested me the options of treatments suitable for me. I didnot have the willingness or courage to go through IVF once again hence I requested him for alternative treatment with the help of medicines/injections only.According to my preference Dr started ovulation induction treatment which was planned for 6 months at least. Initially  I was not responding to the OI medicines but with God's blessings and Dr Dasgupta's expertise the treatment started to work out and miraculously I conceived in the first month of treatment only. It was totally unexpected for me because conceiving naturslly after failure in Ivf was totally unimaginable!\n\nIt was then when I realised Dr Sujoy Dasgupta was God Sent for me. \n\nBut my struggle didnot end there. In fact it became more difficult due to my age of 37 years  and other innumerable complications each day almost till last moment which increased my fear of losing my child once again through out the period !\n\nHowever, with God's Blessings and  dedication, knowledge, confidence and expertise of Dr Dasgupta I have given birth to my little angel, my dearest daughter last week.\n\nI must mention here, during this entire pregnancy period whenever  I contacted Dr Dasgupta he almost immediately responded to me through whatsapp everytime  and helped me get out of the complication arised in spite of his busy schedule . \n\nMy husband,  myself and my entire family shall be eternally greatful to Dr Sujoy Dasgupta.",

We tried for IVF-ICSI which failed for the first time, but we never lost hope on the doctor. We attempted for IVF again under him and on 6th Nov 2023, we were blessed with a baby boy.\n\nWe started the treatment under Dr. Dasgupta during the starting of 2022. He shared the pros and cons of all treatment procedures and presented us the choices for IUI and IVF. His detailed information, especially considering my advanced maternal age, helped us to opt for IVF. He also shared a book authored by him regarding details of IVF pregnancy during the visit which clarified almost all the doubts and any questions that we had.\n\nThe second IVF attempt was progressing smoothly till ovum pickup. We were planning to freeze the embryo and plan for pregnancy later, but doctor suggested for immediate Embryo Transfer within 3 days of pickup, considering the quality of the embryo and the history of the failure of embryo formation during the first attempt. Despite the sudden pregnancy decision was hard to take still we decided to trust him. The pregnancy progressed smoothly till 3rd trimester, although low PAPP-A was detected in NT scan (signifying the growth restriction of placenta). The baby was detected with late onset IUGR in the early 3rd trimester. My son was even not required to be admitted in NICU and stayed with me throughout the hospitalization.\n\nHe is a patient centric doctor who also considers the financial aspects of his patients, which proved to be more helpful to us as we are from a middle class background. Throughout the journey, he explained the pros and cons of most of the medicines and the treatment transparently, never hiding any facts.\n\nThank you sir for your priceless consultations and guidances. Our dream has come true after long years of struggle.",

After the the first visit we came back with a new hope and our depressions left aside after his counselling regarding infertility. Then we started treatment under his supervision and we realised that things are getting better for us day by day and our depression converted in to a positive energy which was only due to his positive counselling and proper treatment to exact root cause. He is patience enough and also kept us patient throughout the treatment. He is expert enough to diagnose infertility issues and propose right treatment to get results. This how we were continuing under his treatment and to our utter surprise one fine morning we got the good news in a very natural way (without any artificial procedures) and we broke in to tears that time and immediately shared the good news with him and then after my wife's entire pregnancy term was strictly and carefully managed by him and on 11thMay2019 we became a proud and happy parent of beautiful baby girl \ud83d\udc67 and started our journey of parenthood. One more thing I would like to share that I haven't seen such expert doctor with such simplicity friendly, understanding and carring behaviour never in my life. Also telephonic support any time if required. \n\nMany thanks to Dr. Sujoy Dasgupta for everything we wish you success for all your endeavours and keep bringing smiles to couples suffering infertility issues. May God bless you and keep you in good health for keeping up the good work. ",

He does not prescribe useless medicines and never asks for unnecessary testings. We were married for 3 years but never enjoyed our conjugal life due to erectile dysfunction of my hubby. He consulted many doctors but all were in vain. Finally when we planned to have a baby, it was found that I had PCOS problems. Many doctors prescribed numerous tests and medicines but nothing worked. Even somebody advised us test tube baby. Nobody addressed our issue properly. So we lost all hopes to conceive naturally. We consulted Dr Dasgupta at his Garia chamber as a last chance. On first consultation he discussed many issues giving us almost 45 minutes time. He prescribed drugs and some exercises to my husband, which worked like magic within few days. His performance improved a lot. He advised me few tests and gave much emphasis on weight loss (which nobody advised before). He said \"I am not God. I cannot give you guarantee. But I can try my level best to make you smile. But I do not give false assurance\". He kept his promises. By God's grace we conceived naturally within 3 months of his consultation. That time he was also beside us. Throughout my pregnancy, whenever I felt any problem I gave his a ring, even if it was midnight. he never felt disturbed and talked to me in gentle way. Even he checked me out of his chamber timing. Finally my baby boy was delivered by him on January 2016 in a midnight (that was also an emergency).... I can never pay his debts. We are now enjoying parenthood as well as conjugal life, only because of him.",

Impressed with such positive reviews and academic excellence of the doctor, we visited him with the intent to conceive. First visit was highly satisfying. Doctor explained everything beautifully and suggested to see him after a few months. On trying for 6-8 months without result, he made necessary prognosis, diagnosis, lab tests and everything came all right. He prescribed a medicine (Ovulation Induction method) and we conceived within 2-3 months. We became joyous at this and without a second thought we kept consulting him throughout the pregnancy period. Sir was extremely patient friendly, and caring. Interaction with Sir has always removed our stress/ worries and filled with positivity and confidence. He never prescribed excess medicines or tests. We followed his advices meticulously throughout the period. He never bothered to reply to our messages whenever we needed to discuss. \nThe best thing we found in Sir is his paying sincere attention to his patients, and explaining the potential risks, possible benefits and remedies. We had some complications like Hypothyroidism, Obstetrics Cholestasis during the period. However, those were medically managed by Sir and everything came out to our expectations. We are blessed with a healthy baby boy two days back at RSV hospital in the ****** ******* *** seasoned hands of Doctor Dasgupta. We are extremely indebted to you Sir for giving the best gift (lifeline) of our lives. Not only the surgery was really painless as felt by my wife, the entire journey has been hassle-free. The goodness and bounty seen in Sir is really rare nowadays and we are extremely fortunate to have received the same. We once again profusely thank you sir for everything. Pray you reach to the zenith of success. My sincere thanks also to the folks who shared their beautiful experiences about Sir and helped us to know about him. From our experience, we can proclaim without hesitations that *** ** *** ** *** **** obstetricians & gynaecologists & infertility experts whom one can rely upon blindly. Sir is very responsible and takes all round care of the patients. \n",

Moreover, scientifically, a single semen analysis is not at all reliable and no treatment can be done based on a single semen analysis. Therefore, it is always advisable to do semen analysis from infertility laboratory to confirm whether it is actually good or bad. Many times we have seen the second semen analysis report is completely different. \nIn any infertility clinic of the World, both husband and wife need to come together. Even if there is problem in husband's sperm only, the wife need to be seen by the infertility specialist who will discuss the treatment ONLY after seeing reports of both. In our centre, the charge Rs 1200 includes \n1. Consultation charges for both husband and wife \n2. Psychological counseling, which is mandatory for any infertility clinic as per Govt of India \n3. TVS ultrasound for wife.\nYou paid the charge and we offered you all these but you refused treatment and any test for your wife.\nYou wanted to act very smart and you thought only your report will be checked. Medicine practice has its rule and you can NOT change the way of treatment. We requested you to do evaluation of your wife which would have been done without spending anything extra. But you refused that. You repeatedly insisted on medicines. Before giving any medicine we need to see whether medicine is actually needed. But you were very much stubborn and you thought you know everything of infertility treatment. \nWe are thankful that our patients rely completely on us when they come to our clinic. \nI will advise you to write a book on infertility treatment where you can dictate how treatment should be done.

Still, there was no problem in it. I was given a time of 1 o'clock, but Dr. had to leave the house and he directly told me angrily that why have you come now, I cannot see now *** ***** **** **** **** ** * **** * **** *** ** **** ** *** ********* I had my semen test report,  which I had tested in *** ** **** semen analysis lab, kolkata, in which I had spent 1600 rupees, but till then I did not know that by going to a clinic, I would have to test again and spend money. The doctor neither saw that report nor gave any suggestions, didn't even ask anything and just wrote in his pad for a semen test in their lab only and will consult with both of husband and wife.And in just 5 minutes, without giving any suggestions, asked to leave. I took out my time from the office and came here just to spend 1200 without any benefit .*** ****** * ***** ** **** **** ** **** ******* ** ** ** *** ** *** * *** ******* *** ********* ** *** ** ****** ** ******* ** Anyway I have to do my test elsewhere but the behaviour of Dr. was not good. We are the patients and if you have no time to see your patients properly kindly tell your agents or receptionist not to allow any patient for consultant in your out time. 1200 rs gone for no reason..its a big amount for me ** ******* ***** ** ********* ****** ***** ** *** again you are told to do the same report. Thanks",

Some patients need extra time (even an hour) while in some other cases the consultation can be completed within 5 minutes.\nRegarding your problem our Dr already reassured you that you did not have any big problem and advised some tests.\nThen you showed tests and medicines advised by other doctors and asked for opinion on it. Nobody can judge the prescription of another doctor. We can not comment on tests advised by other doctors.\nEven finally he requested that he was having an emergency (because we cannot endanger other patient's life when that patient requires URGENT medical attention). But you repeatedly asked to know the SPELLING OF EACH TEST advised by the doctor. The tests were clearly written in prescription and it did not require the doctor to spell the name of each test.\nTherefore in future when you visit any doctor, please remember,\n1) all patients may not get equal time in consultation. The time depends on the severity of the problem patient is suffering.\n2) don't compete with other patients regarding time\n3) don't ask the doctor to judge the prescription of another doctor. (You purposefully avoided explanation of this).\n4) the spelling of the tests can be asked from the laboratory.\nGood luck.",

Thank you for your unconditional faith on us from the very beginning.\nRegarding Covid 19 pandemic, it was totally unexpected. We never anticipated such things. That's why we have not been able to provide the care according to our standard protocol. We have to omit many check up, tests and medicines just to avoid spreading the infection according to the Govt policy. We feel this is very tough time, especially for those who are pregnant and their family members. We are trying our best to support them via phone and Whatsapp.\nThank you again for your kind words of appreciation.",

Since my husband used to work out of West Bengal,  we could not start the treatment immediately and visited Dr after few months with the results of the tests once my husband shifted to Kolkata exclusively for the purpose of my treatment. \n\nBased on the reports of the tests advised by Dr Dasgupta, he suggested me the options of treatments suitable for me. I didnot have the willingness or courage to go through IVF once again hence I requested him for alternative treatment with the help of medicines/injections only.According to my preference Dr started ovulation induction treatment which was planned for 6 months at least. Initially  I was not responding to the OI medicines but with God's blessings and Dr Dasgupta's expertise the treatment started to work out and miraculously I conceived in the first month of treatment only. It was totally unexpected for me because conceiving naturslly after failure in Ivf was totally unimaginable!\n\nIt was then when I realised Dr Sujoy Dasgupta was God Sent for me. \n\nBut my struggle didnot end there. In fact it became more difficult due to my age of 37 years  and other innumerable complications each day almost till last moment which increased my fear of losing my child once again through out the period !\n\nHowever, with God's Blessings and  dedication, knowledge, confidence and expertise of Dr Dasgupta I have given birth to my little angel, my dearest daughter last week.\n\nI must mention here, during this entire pregnancy period whenever  I contacted Dr Dasgupta he almost immediately responded to me through whatsapp everytime  and helped me get out of the complication arised in spite of his busy schedule . \n\nMy husband,  myself and my entire family shall be eternally greatful to Dr Sujoy Dasgupta.",

All the reports of me and my husband were normal except abnormal \"TORCH IgG\". Some senior doctor advised us not to conceive until the report becomes normal. But we were desperate to conceive and so consulted Dr Dasgupta. He assured that TORCH tests means nothing and we can conceive without fear. He said he would put stitch to the mouth of my uterus after I conceive to prevent miscarriage. I conceived and he put stitch at 20 weeks. That small stitch appeared to change my life drastically. Finally my baby boy saw the light of this world in August, 2015 in hands of Dr Dasgupta. Thank you doctor for helping us to enjoy the parenthood. Not to mention how he entertained my disturbing call to him in odd times whenever I felt any problems. he never got angry.",

Fortunate ly I conceived naturally but it was a high risk pregnancy. I was already having high blood pressure and in pregnancy there was diabetes. I also had asthma. But my doctor took all my responsibility throughout my pregnancy. He himself talked to my other doctors before referring to me to them for pressure and sugar problems. Whenever any special tests were needed (as I was already 39- to see if my baby was normal inside uterus or not) he himself arranged for it so that we do not gave to rush. Even when I had delivery pain, my husband was out of station because of official wirk and my pain occurred much before time. When my mother took me to dr Dasgupta he assured that do not get afraid. I will try my best to save the mother and tgis precious baby. And it was emergency delivery done by him at midnight.... At that ti e also he arranged other doctors so that my pressure and sugar remained normal. My husband reached Kolkata by next day and found that I wad sitting with my baby. This is the day for which we both waited for ling time. I would recommend everyone to consult Dr Dasgupta who is knowledgeable and explains everything before prescription.

Thanks Dr. Sujoy Dasguptafor comforting us and taking way all our stress. It was a great privilege and an unforgettable experience to have met you 3 years ago, when we were gifted our 1st baby under your guidance. So we did not think twice to visit you again after getting the news of 2nd pregnancy. The littlest feet make the biggest footprints in our heart and you are the pacemaker wrapped with kindness and caring nature. It was the humanity and brotherly love rather than professionalism showed by you throughout this journey. You may not know what you did for us, because we are now one of the happiest families with 2 children born in your hands i.e. garden of humanity. May your days be full of good health just like you help all of us. We will be forever grateful to you. With lots of love and respect\u2026..\n                                   Mr. & Mrs. Mahanti\n",

But the Doctor gave us very little time in each seating and it seemed that the problem, whatever it is with me, remained unsolved after more than a year. Then a colleague of my husband suggested us about Dr Sujoy Dasgupta (from now on, I will address him as 'Sir'). We visited Sir at Garia, Friends Diagnostics. From the first day, Sir was very supportive and thorough, he consulted with us like a friend, giving all the possible options. The problem for which I was unable to conceive till that time, was identified by Sir within a week. After then, following his advice, I became pregnant which was an amazing experience. \nAs my hometown is Krishnanagar, we could not visit Sir after lockdown, but he was always there whenever we required advices. I am unfortunate that I was unable to have Sir beside me during the most important incident of my life, due to pandemic situation, but I know it is his blessings that leads us to our parenthood.\n******** * **** ******* ** **** *** ** ******** ***** *** ****** * **** *** *** ** ***** ***** Thank you very much Sir.",

Yes it was Dr. Dasgupta who explained me everything in details with love & care. It was not the first time he clarified, I visited him 8 times throughout my pregnancy & in every visit he discussed me the facts that the pregnancy is a normal event of my day to day life. The best part of my gynaecologist is his precise, particular & comprehensive advice regarding laboratory tests & medications; for eg. he advised me to take iron tablet at 11 am (fixed time) with lemon juice for better absorption etc. Finally the day came when I was sent to OT with tension but within few minutes he completed the operation **** *** ******** qualified hand & satisfied my lap with a baby princess who is now 1 month old.

He asked \"What we have thought about treatment\". He explained everything in details. Replied to phone and whatsapp quickly. I had severe PCOD, tried many medicines and injections and USG. Nothing worked. He gave options like IUI and IVF and explained them in details. We decided for 2 IUI and then IVF. first IUI failed. Again he supported us. We decided to give last try in IUI and then IVF. Fortunately we conceived. Today I am proud mother. Thanks a lot Dr Dasgupta",

As a doctor, its not possible for us to provide successful treatment for each and every condition. But its definitely possible for us to give detailed information about the problem and the disease, to give support and to help the patients making own decision. We respect patient's autonomy. That means, we do not want to put our decision on patients. We just discuss the all possible options and merits and demerits of each option, so that patients can take own decision. Pregnancy is not a disease, but its a process that turns a woman into a mother. It has huge impact for other persons in the family too. We understand that the couples feel excited about the pregnancy and at the same time there is justifiable anxiety regarding the unborn and the process of pregnancy and delivery. we know that its only the couple who have to travel through this path but we can guide them throughout, advise them what to do and what not to do, answer their all questions, (as it's quite natural for the women to ask some questions, which sometimes may seem like \"stupid\"- but these are rational for them). When a person is admitted to hospital, he or she feels nervous and lonely. We may not be there for long time but timely attendance can provide them reassurance and help them recover fast. This is more important for a pregnant woman, who need to take care of herself, as well as her baby. Thank you again for your kind words. With lots of blessings for your little prince....",

Unfortunately all do not have same story and many have to struggle a lot to fulfill their dreams. As a doctor, we understand their problems but often our treatment have limitations. All we can do it, is to give them support and scientific treatment. We believe that standing by those who need it, is more important than mere writing few advice in prescription. We pray to the almighty to give us the strength so that we can fulfill the unaccomplished dreams of all of our patients and stand beside them in need. Thank you very much for your kind words. best wishes for your little bundle of joy.",

We try to reduce the stress, at the same time we must be honest towards the patients and so we do not try to give any unrealistic hope. We always try to do minimum interventions so that the patients can go back to normal life as soon as possible after operation. It's really a pleasant feeling that the patient herself and your family are happy with our \"patient-centric approach\" as we believe in patient's autonomy, i.e., only patient can take her decision after proper explanation and provision of information.",

When we visited his chamber, he arranged for ultrasound in another centre, so that we did not have to wait much. But my baby was found not to grow well.

This is because they have not experienced it earlier and are very much concerned abut the unborn baby.  We strongly believe that patients have the right to take decision and so we try our best to explain everything so that patients can take their own decision weighing merits and demerits of a particular treatment, rather than forcing a treatment decision on patients.

He gave me reassurance and told that nothing will happen and there are tests to now whether there is any problems of the baby or not. I felt scared, still keeping faith on him, I continued pregnancy.

He arranged an ultrasound within the hour and when there was trouble, had me referred to the best clinic in the city the very next day. He followed us through significant problems. Sadly, we miscarried, and he was there for us too. I highly recommend Dr Dasgupta. He's knowledgeable, compassionate and went \"the extra mile\" for two foreigners who knew nothing about how the Indian medical system worked. Thanks, Dr Dasgupta. We will never forget your kindness and care for both of us",

Repeated Miscarriage is one of such conditions, where we need to explain the disease, the future aspect, facts and figures, so that the patient herself can understand her condition. Now regarding patient's view, we believe in patients' autonomy, i.e., we encourage our patients to take their decision after explaining pros and cons of all the options. Of course there are certain couples for whom IVF is needed. But for majority of the couples IVF is not the only way of treatment. Pregnancy is a journey towards uncertainty and all of a sudden an apparently uncomplicated pregnancy may take a different turn. That's why we need to be vigilant throughout. We are grateful to you that you completely relied on our way of treatment from pre-pregnancy period till delivery. We are really happy to see your smiling face on this Puja. Enjoy your parenthood. Thank you again for your time to write this review and recommendation.",

When I met him in person, I found him approachable and professional. He was patient enough to understand our case and explained us his treatment plan with pros and cons. He encouraged us to conceive naturally and we went ahead with his plan as we were convinced. He was always available on whatsapp or phone whenever we reached him even at odd hours during my pregnancy. \nToday, we are proud parent of our sweet angel. He and his team helped us to get the best gift of our life this Navaratri; we are indebted to him for fulfilling our long-cherished dream.\nI would say his medical expertise and dedication is unmatchable to any other gynaecologists we had consulted so far.",

Considering their previous experience, they always remain anxious. It's our duty to stand by them that time. \nFinally, it's really a great feeling to become part of your proud moment at the end of the struggle. \nThank you again for your valuable feedback. ",

Now, after marriage, I suddenly felt sexual problems, that I could not share with anybody. I felt difficult to maintain erection. I consulted many persons but all in vain. My wife, Brishti took me to Dr Dasgupta, almost forcefully. He gave me long time, addressed my all the issues and gave very effective and practical solution. After his advice, all of my doubts and problems are gone. Finally I am now able to have happy married life. He is genuinely a patient-friendly doctor. I want all such patients to be treated by him.",

He diagnosed our problems and suggested all the possible ways of treatment with their merits and demerits. He was always there to soothe our anxiety by receiving our calls and replying our texts.\n\nFinally with the bliss of Almighty and the efficient guidance and constant support of Dr. Sujoy Dasgupta we are blessed with the most cherished gift of our life, our baby boy Spandan.\n\nTo be very honest, \nOur hearts were distressed\nBut Sir has made it alive once again by restoring its Spandan.",

Also, I talked to him over the phone as my wife was having some problems in her 5 months of pregnancy and he listened to me carefully and gave his suggestions.

I've undergone a cesarean section under him. It took nearly 25 to 30 minutes for the whole procedure and the team inside the OT was very professional. They've explained the whole procedure one by one and made me very comfortable which helped me to stay calm and fear-free throughout the procedure. Now we are blessed with a baby boy and all the credit goes to Dr. Dasgupta. I highly recommend him so don't think twice to choose him. Another best part is he made sure that I live a normal life like a normal person during my pregnancy and soon after delivery. It is him who told me that I can resume my normal activities after a week of my delivery and touchwood I did the same. Now after a month, I'm writing this and by the grace of the universe, I'm completely alright and living a normal life. All thanks to Dr. Sujoy Dasgupta.",

There is no \"full-proof treatment\" for Infertility. Every Treatment has its pros and cons. That's why the couple should discuss in details with the doctor before taking the decision for a particular treatment. Majority of the couples actually conceive with proper treatment. But the decision must be taken by the couple, of course after consulting the doctor. \nSecondly any pregnancy leads to lots of anxiety for the couples. This is particularly true for those who conceive after Infertility Treatment. Our duty is to guide the women , to provide them proper medical care, to remove all misconceptions, to give them support and to give proper explanation. At the same time, we emphasize that \"Pregnancy is NOT a disease\", so we advise the women to remain as \"normal\" as possible.\nThanks a lot again for your kind appreciation in elaborative and detailed fashion.",

We should not only take care of the medicine and treatment, but also the social and especially the psychological aspects.  We know such unfortunate couples are in stress and in many troubles from social, personal and financial point of view. We believe in patient's autonomy and always encourage patient's own participation in decision making and treatment.  We know, no treatment is hundred percent guaranteed and so we must be honest towards the patients. And regarding pregnancy, we know its an important aspect in patient's life and the woman often feels very much tensed and concerned for the unborn baby. So its our moral duty to stand beside them in time. Thanks a lot.",

Now I am carrying 6 months. I never hesitate to give him a call every now and then because he pays proper attention to my problems. He advised me injection Lonopin which I could not afford fir its cost. He himself taljed to the manufacturer so that I can have the drugs at very liw price.

She was overweight from the beginning and was put under diet, further to this during pregnancy she developed some unpleasant challenges like pcod, fatty lever, stone etc. However, proper guidance of Dr Dasgupta helped us to normalise those effectively.

We are grateful to you for relying on our treatment from the beginning. Thanks a lot. Lots of blessings for your little bundle of joy. ",

Through out my pregnancy his guidance was more than satisfactory  in this  pandemic situation. As all time it was not possible to visit him, so he was fully available in social media. Whenever it was needed he was there to support in every possible way.My baby GIRL was born on 11th Aug 2020.  Thank you is a very small word for him.. Though i want to thank you sir for gifting us the most precious gift of our lives on the auspicious day of Janmastami.",

When a couple comes before pregnancy, our aim is to give them support as they are already stressed, start proper tests and treatment and at the same time to avoid unnecessary tests and treatment. So, you have seen that we did not want to do tests as you just tried only for few months when you came to me.\nNow regarding diabetes in pregnancy, Indian women are predisposed to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which can affect the health of mother and baby and may lead to long-standing diabetes in mother, even after pregnancy. As per international recommendations, we advise ALL PREGNANT WOMEN OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) using 75 gram glucose, because this is the ONLY RECOMMENDED TEST that can pick up diabetes in pregnancy (Not simple fasting or PP Sugar). If its diagnosed, mother needs proper monitoring including checking kidney, eye and regular ultrasound of baby and timely delivery.

I consulted so many doctors but all in vain but finally one of my doctor advised me to have laparoscopy to treat this disease as I had cysts in my ovaries. But both my husband and I was not ready for the operation. We consulted Dr Dasgupta for second opinion, he said \"we can operate at any time but why should not we try drug and then operate if the drug fails\"? This comment seemed to be very much convincing for me. So, as per his instruction, I took 3 injections once in a month each and at that time he said that I will not have pain but my periods will remain stopped. His words came true and when I repeated ultrasonography after 3 months, my cysts disappeared. Then Dr Dasgupta started to give drugs for my infertility problems and within 6 months I conceived. Now I am enjoying motherhood, avoiding unnecessary surgery only because of him. I will always remain grateful to him.",

Really we never faced any difficulties, all time we get proper and promt advice as well as full support all the way of this special journey. Finally the day has come. It was 5th October'2020, My Girl Baby was born in a safe hand so smoothly. My baby and myself are good now.  No statement will compare with his talent, experience, behaviour and knowledge.  Dr. Dasgupta is just awesome who gave us our 'Maa Dugga' with his Magic Hand.\nThank you very much Dr. Sujoy Dasgupta. We are overwhelmed.",

Medical treatment is often expensive because of use of ultramodern technologies, which are definitely benefitting the patients. At the same time, we take hard endeavour to reduce the costs as far as practicable. \nWe believe in \"Patient Centred care\" that means we do not want to insist our patients on a particular treatment, rather we love to give them options, discuss the merits and demerits of each, so that they can take their own \"Informed Decision\", exactly what is practised in the Western countries. \nWe think the patients coming to us are \"blindly\" relying on our words and treatment. That makes us feel more responsible towards them\n At the end of the day, what we all want, is the smiling face of the patients. Thankfully we have been able to do that in your case. \nWe are grateful to you for giving us the opportunity to treat you and the opportunity to prove that we are worth your faiths.

But certainly we can give our best efforts to optimise the outcome. At the same time we need to make the women feel that they are not alone in their Pregnancy and complications. We are always there. That's why we give emphasis on explanation on what can happen, why we are advising some tests and some treatment and our next plan of action. Thank you for your kind review",

He advised you the medicine named Norethosterone and explained you that it should be continued until further advice, because if the medicine is stopped Suddenly, bleeding can be heavy again. You, at that point of time, repeatedly asked for permanent cure. Our Doctor explained you that it will take time and advised you to follow the advice. There is nothing called \"Guarantee\" in medical science. If a patient, after several times of explanation, asks for guarantee, we are really helpless, because WE CANNOT GIVE ANY FALSE REASSURANCE.

But it was possible because both of you cooperated with us from the very beginning and relied on our words. Pregnancy is another journey. Unexpectedly this time we all were challenged with the pandemic, which we never anticipated. We feel it's difficult time for everyone but especially for pregnant women. We are trying our best by supporting them in phone and Whatsapp. However, we know we are not able to provide the ideal care at this moment.
