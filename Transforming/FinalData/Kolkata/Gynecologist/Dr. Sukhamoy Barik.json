The very first day of my meeting with the Dr. Barik I was simply impressed with his down to earth welcoming behaviour. After 30 weeks of pregnancy my case got complicated as the BP shoot up He guided me all through this difficult period of preterm and high BP to smooth delivery of my twin. His is a rare  combination of high skill and professionalism with amicable behaviour . In his extreme schedule he has enough time to  listen the patient\u2019s problem and quarries with a broad smile. It\u2019s a blessing to come across with  such a wonderful  Doctor as well as a person in a difficult time. May God bless him.  \n",

Post pregnancy too his advice and suggestions were very valuable to me .

Still you have used some offensive words against me without knowing the actual fact. No issue. That might be your nature. \nI think i should clarify few things. \n\nFirstly: My Consultation fees in my private chamber is not 700 (Too much), you should better ask your wife. Even i didn't take any fees from your wife during last visit . Don't you know that?\u00a0 \n\nSecond: Hospital authority has full right whether they will admit CGHS covid patient or not. Doctor has no right . They can only treat the patient. \n\nThird: Ask your wife, she know why i told her to get admitted. Opinion may vary from doctor to doctor. Nothing is universal. \n\nLastly:\u00a0 I don't know where you get the figure 6.5lacs. I do LSCS of Covid patient at Charnock Hospital regularly.\u00a0 Cost is maximum one fifth of your quoted amount. \n\n(N.B: Check any hospital bill. You will get the information how much a doctor get out the bill amount)\n\nIf you really want to criticize me , it is welcomed.\u00a0 But don't fabricate the truth.\nStay healthy \n",

Dr. sukhomoy barik  listened our case patiently ,guided and helped us in admission in 2 different hospitals ( one for fever and other for delivery) during the peak corona time. Today i am blessed with a lovely healthy child. I am really indebted by his efforts and deeds. Lastly , i would like to mention his  soft, helpful and approachable behaviour  which induces confidence in a patient's mind even in a overbearing complex situation. God bless you sir.",

The reviews and ratings were so good that we decide to book an appointment with him. I must say it\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. He is one of those few doctors who encourages his patients to give a try for NVD which is again very rare practice in West Bengal. At the last stage of my pregnancy I was diagnosed with Obstetric Cholestasis; My sgot sgpt levels were so high that I had to deliver my baby via c section. I was very nervous about the whole process because I always wanted to deliver my baby naturally. Dr. Barik explained the whole process and helped me to overcome my anxiety about the situation. \n\nFinally, I just want to say \u2014 \nDear Dr. Barik, Thank you for your guidance and help to bring our little bundle of joy to this world. Thank you for listening to all those queries and never being impatient answering any. That parting gift (a laminated photo of me and my baby soon after delivery) you gave us was a great gesture. God bless you and your family!",

After 30 weeks of pregnancy my case got complicated as the BP shoot up He guided me all through this difficult period of preterm and high BP to smooth delivery of my twin. His is a rare  combination of high skill and professionalism with amicable behaviour . In his extreme schedule he has enough time to  listen the patient\u2019s problem and quarries with a broad smile. It\u2019s a blessing to come across with  such a wonderful  Doctor as well as a person in a difficult time. May God bless him.  \n",

Still you have used some offensive words against me without knowing the actual fact. No issue. That might be your nature. \nI think i should clarify few things. \n\nFirstly: My Consultation fees in my private chamber is not 700 (Too much), you should better ask your wife. Even i didn't take any fees from your wife during last visit . Don't you know that?\u00a0 \n\nSecond: Hospital authority has full right whether they will admit CGHS covid patient or not. Doctor has no right . They can only treat the patient. \n\nThird: Ask your wife, she know why i told her to get admitted. Opinion may vary from doctor to doctor. Nothing is universal. \n\nLastly:\u00a0 I don't know where you get the figure 6.5lacs. I do LSCS of Covid patient at Charnock Hospital regularly.\u00a0 Cost is maximum one fifth of your quoted amount. \n\n(N.B: Check any hospital bill. You will get the information how much a doctor get out the bill amount)\n\nIf you really want to criticize me , it is welcomed.\u00a0 But don't fabricate the truth.\nStay healthy \n",

Today i am blessed with a lovely healthy child. I am really indebted by his efforts and deeds. Lastly , i would like to mention his  soft, helpful and approachable behaviour  which induces confidence in a patient's mind even in a overbearing complex situation. God bless you sir.",

The reviews and ratings were so good that we decide to book an appointment with him. I must say it\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. He is one of those few doctors who encourages his patients to give a try for NVD which is again very rare practice in West Bengal. At the last stage of my pregnancy I was diagnosed with Obstetric Cholestasis; My sgot sgpt levels were so high that I had to deliver my baby via c section. I was very nervous about the whole process because I always wanted to deliver my baby naturally. Dr. Barik explained the whole process and helped me to overcome my anxiety about the situation. \n\nFinally, I just want to say \u2014 \nDear Dr. Barik, Thank you for your guidance and help to bring our little bundle of joy to this world. Thank you for listening to all those queries and never being impatient answering any. That parting gift (a laminated photo of me and my baby soon after delivery) you gave us was a great gesture. God bless you and your family!",
