I am a patient of Dilated Cardiomyopathy and was referred to a Cardiologist by my family physician. Interestingly the Cardiologist I consulted was asking me to get 'n' number of tests done and changing medicines without no symptomatic improvement. I was completely frustrated with such a unyielding management technique.\r\nOne of my colleagues referred to Dr. Patra and I was astonished to know I was suffering from Resistant Heart Failure that was causing multiple hospitalisations. He suggested me to go for Implantation of ICD device . It was the latest discovery in the science of Cardiology and have prolonged life of patients like mine.\r\nI got the device implanted in the month of January this year and its almost 10 months I am practically free from any symptoms. This was a miraculous operation he had done on me. Even my friends and colleagues are surpised regarding my health as they had seen me most of the time getting admitted in ICU of different Hospitals of the city\r\nI would strongly recommend Dr. Patra to everyone seeking for Cardiological Advice.",

We had consulted 2 more cardiologists whi tried to get an ANGIOPLASTY done somehow or other and we were forced to do the angiography. There was heavy bleeding from the puncture site and she had to prolong her stay due such a mishap.\r\nOne of our friends recommended about Dr. Patra and when we consulted him we were astonished to find that the CD of the angiography done was previous doctor was partially done and the pictures were for only one artery. \r\nWe got an ANGIOGRAPHY done by him and that too through radial artery. It was an absolute painless process. He explained us the choice between ANGIOPLASTY and BY PASS Surgery. Over last 10 months my mother is under his treatment and we had never done any angioplasty. He regularly optimises the medicines my mother is taking and she is practically pain free. I have seen my mother breaking stairs upto 2 storey building without any pain or shoprtness of breath. \r\nThis consultation have saved us lakhs of rupees. If we had fallen prey to any of those malpractising cardiologists, my mother would have suffered and unwanted operation and debility.\r\nI will always remain thankful to Dr. Patra for his effort.",
