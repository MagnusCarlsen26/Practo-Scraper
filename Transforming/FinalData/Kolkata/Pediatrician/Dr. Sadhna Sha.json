We understood it was not a situation which warranted  ICU admission and decided to contact our family paediatrician the next morning. However the next morning our family paediatrician said she would not be able to see before the evening. It was then we googled and came across Dr Sha. One call and she immediately gave us an appointment for the morning. And helped us in getting admission to a normal ward in a hospital. Took good care of her for the next 3 days and came 2 times a day to check on her health.  It is said that doctors is another form of God and she is an very apt example for the same.\n",

This was for the first time that my baby recovered without antibiotics otherwise we always had to give him antibiotics for cough and cold. This was very frequent since my baby was 7 months old and I was used to giving antibiotics which was at the same time very painful for me. This got my faith on her after that. Next when my baby was 17 months he again got cough and cold and we continued the same medicine for 4 days but  his condition did not improve so we visited Dr Sadhna again. She told us to stop the medicine and let him recover on his own as his chest was clear. I was surprised to see that it worked. For the first time my baby recovered on his own from cough and cold. Last time we visited her for vaccination. It was also not very painful for my baby. A few more good things about her is that you don't have to wait with your baby for very long as she plans visit timing with accuracy. The sitting area has enough space for your baby to play. She also gives sufficient time to explain the details and monitor baby. Her clinic is v cosy and child friendly.Dr is v caring,impeccable with  v good communication and  I  strongly recommend Dr Sadhna ** *** ** *** ****** ***** * **** *** ** ****",

However the next morning our family paediatrician said she would not be able to see before the evening. It was then we googled and came across Dr Sha. One call and she immediately gave us an appointment for the morning. And helped us in getting admission to a normal ward in a hospital. Took good care of her for the next 3 days and came 2 times a day to check on her health.  It is said that doctors is another form of God and she is an very apt example for the same.\n",

This was for the first time that my baby recovered without antibiotics otherwise we always had to give him antibiotics for cough and cold. This was very frequent since my baby was 7 months old and I was used to giving antibiotics which was at the same time very painful for me. This got my faith on her after that. Next when my baby was 17 months he again got cough and cold and we continued the same medicine for 4 days but  his condition did not improve so we visited Dr Sadhna again. She told us to stop the medicine and let him recover on his own as his chest was clear. I was surprised to see that it worked. For the first time my baby recovered on his own from cough and cold. Last time we visited her for vaccination. It was also not very painful for my baby. A few more good things about her is that you don't have to wait with your baby for very long as she plans visit timing with accuracy. The sitting area has enough space for your baby to play. She also gives sufficient time to explain the details and monitor baby. Her clinic is v cosy and child friendly.Dr is v caring,impeccable with  v good communication and  I  strongly recommend Dr Sadhna ** *** ** *** ****** ***** * **** *** ** ****",
