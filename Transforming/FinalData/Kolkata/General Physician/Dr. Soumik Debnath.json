I consulted Dr Soumik after my phase1 treatment at home I. e. after one week of covid attack which is very crucial for every covid patient. Based on my CT scan reports doctor advised me to admit into hospital however in Vizag due to scarcity of beds with oxygen we couldn't find suitable hospital while oxygen levels are closing down to 92.   After listening to my health developments the doctor advised me an excellent prescription to continue treatment at home. Now, after a couple of days,I am fully out of danger. Thanks alot doctor for your valuable service. After that, I referred him to more than a half dozen patients of same kind. General advice to covid patients:Every covid patient better continue treatment at home after duly consulting doctor. Even don't panic about oxygen levels. use pulse oxymeter to check oxygen levels regularly and continue treatment at home with doctor's support. ",
