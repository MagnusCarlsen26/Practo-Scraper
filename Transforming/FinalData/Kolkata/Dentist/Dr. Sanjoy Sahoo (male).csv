"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Surgery,",0,0,YES,"My father has been Dr. Sahoo's patient for a while, so he came highly recommended. I needed an emergency tooth extraction and dental filling, along with scaling - he did all of these in only two sittings, with me spending less than an hour in total inside his chamber. He's quite understanding, offering his advice in a calm, friendly, and non-judgmental manner. 

His surgical skills are fantastic. Having heard from other friends about how much they bled during scaling, I was quite apprehensive. He spoke to me through the process and completed the entire thing in 10-12 minutes with no pain sensation and surprisingly minimal bleeding. 

I recommend him most enthusiastically. ",2021-06-28 18:45:37,False,True,AGNIDIPTO TARAFDER,,,
