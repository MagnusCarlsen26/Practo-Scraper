As I was having less time due to my marriage, he was able to treat me within short span of time. Happy with the treatment and writing this review post 10 days of treatment. Doctor is friendly, understand your issue and treated me with due care.  Good work by Dr. Akshay Khandelwal. They have a good practice to call the patients for their well-being post treatment. Kudos to the team. Good work by Dr. Ananya Mishra as she did good job for placement of caps.  She too understand the issue and explain them in detail to make sure that all the relevant information has been passed on to the patient. I would recommend this team for your dental issues.Only negative is that the fees for RCT and caps are little expensive than most.",

As I was having less time due to my marriage, he was able to treat me within short span of time. Happy with the treatment and writing this review post 10 days of treatment. Doctor is friendly, understand your issue and treated me with due care.  Good work by Dr. Akshay Khandelwal. They have a good practice to call the patients for their well-being post treatment. Kudos to the team. Good work by Dr. Ananya Mishra as she did good job for placement of caps.  She too understand the issue and explain them in detail to make sure that all the relevant information has been passed on to the patient. I would recommend this team for your dental issues.Only negative is that the fees for RCT and caps are little expensive than most.",
