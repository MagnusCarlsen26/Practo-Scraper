I am really satisfied since the treatment. The procedure was extremely smooth and it didn't even pain while he gave me the anesthesia injection which was one of my biggest fears. He also took necessary precautions like measuring the temperature and oxygen, gave me hand gloves and hairnet in this pandemic situation.Thank you sir for treating my problem so well.",

Nonetheless we payed, thought may be the quality must be good. But in two days the filling of two teeth came out. On 09th October we called the doctor and he gave us an appointment on the same day. When we came we talked him the reason of our visit and I requested him just redo only those teeth where the filling fall out. He said that there is one more tooth nearby with cavity so I agreed to make cavity treatment of that too. When the work was done he on his own applied sum gel on the teeth which cost 3k. Overall he charged us 8k. Even for the teeth that he fill so badly he charged us again. I tried to explain that at this period of life with pandemic for us to be overcharged is difficulty he did not pay any attention to our words and we had no any other way to pay his bill. So, who ever is going to visit the doctor my suggestion first ask him how much he is going to charge you, so you shall not be in a position where we have been.",

                "reply_text": "Mr. Kumar,I am sorry you had to wait on  your appointment date because I was engaged in one emergency surgery for another patient. \nSecondly, regarding your case, myself being a specialist periodontal surgeon, I feel it is an absolute must to get your wisdom tooth extracted surgically considering its position inside your jaw and the degree of pericoronitis and associated gum infection you were suffering from because of that impacted wisdom tooth. Your pain has subsided only temporarily because of the antibiotics and painkillers which were prescribed. But I repeat that this is only a temporary relief and the pain will occur with more severity anytime in near future and it will be a recurrent chronic problem if you don't get that impacted wisdom tooth extracted. \nSURGICAL EXTRACTION OF THE IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH IS THE ONLY PERMANENT SOLUTION TO YOUR PROBLEM. \nThis is my opinion being a specialist in this field and having more than 10 years of experience in seeing and handling such cases. \nHowever, other doctors might have their own opinion too for which I am not really bothered and concerned about. \n",

When doctor saw my wisdom teeth directly suggest me to extraction of teeth because of no space and tell me abt cost rs 10,000 and one another surgeon will come on his clinic for this work, but when I visited another hospital they suggested me don't extract your wisdom teeth because u have proper space in your mouth and it is not harmful for other teeth and now a day I feel very ok without extraction of teeth\nPlease think once.

Nonetheless we payed, thought may be the quality must be good. But in two days the filling of two teeth came out. On 09th October we called the doctor and he gave us an appointment on the same day. When we came we talked him the reason of our visit and I requested him just redo only those teeth where the filling fall out. He said that there is one more tooth nearby with cavity so I agreed to make cavity treatment of that too. When the work was done he on his own applied sum gel on the teeth which cost 3k. Overall he charged us 8k. Even for the teeth that he fill so badly he charged us again. I tried to explain that at this period of life with pandemic for us to be overcharged is difficulty he did not pay any attention to our words and we had no any other way to pay his bill. So, who ever is going to visit the doctor my suggestion first ask him how much he is going to charge you, so you shall not be in a position where we have been.",

Your pain has subsided only temporarily because of the antibiotics and painkillers which were prescribed. But I repeat that this is only a temporary relief and the pain will occur with more severity anytime in near future and it will be a recurrent chronic problem if you don't get that impacted wisdom tooth extracted. \nSURGICAL EXTRACTION OF THE IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH IS THE ONLY PERMANENT SOLUTION TO YOUR PROBLEM. \nThis is my opinion being a specialist in this field and having more than 10 years of experience in seeing and handling such cases. \nHowever, other doctors might have their own opinion too for which I am not really bothered and concerned about. \n",

                "reply_text": "Mr. Arijit, you came with the problem of recurrent swelling and pain in the upper incisive papilla region of your palatal gum tissue. I noticed you have an extremely deep bite in the anterior region of mouth, your upper central incisors are rotated inwards and your lower incisors are intruded. That is why everytime  when you are biting, the edges of your lower incisors are impinging on the opposing gum tissue at the incisive papilla region of your palate. This constant trauma on the gum tissue is causing recurrent swelling and pain in that region. In no way any antibiotic or any antiseptic gel is going to give you a permanent cure or solution to your problem until and unless your anterior deep bite is corrected and your teeth are aligned properly. Medicines and ointments will only give you stopgap or temporary relief from pain, but it will again recur for sure. So anterior deep bite correction is of prime importance for you for a permanent solution to your problem.\nRegarding consultation fees, I have done selective grinding with respect to your lower incisors for which I have charged Rs.200 over and above my consultation fees of Rs. 300. So the cumulative total fees charged from you was Rs. 500. My consultation fees is always Rs. 300 as shown in Practo. So please don't suffer from any misconceptions.",

However, the threshold of pain tolerance differs from patient to patient, which is not possible to ascertain before any dental procedure, especially dental surgeries. That's why even after administering considerable amount of anaesthesia, some patients may still experience pain while someone else may not feel any pain. In such cases it is perfectly normal to abort the procedure for the time being and wait for few days. This is NOT A FAULT ON THE PART OF THE DOCTOR.",

You must have applied some shearing force on  your front tooth by biting on something hard which I instructed you to strictly avoid. That abrupt force application has resulted in the filling being dislodged. In no way is the dentist responsible for this. \nRebuilding an angle fracture in front tooth is off course chargeable because it involves a lot of skill, labour, manual dexterity on the part of the dentist as well as expensive materials which is required.
