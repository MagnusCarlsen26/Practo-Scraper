"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"i am totally happy with the way she explained about my issue. Where many doctors would have suggested me to remove my second wisdom tooth she asked me not to play with it until it bothers me! 
i was also having post surgery pain ( problem in opening my mouth fully). She gave me medications  which i followed for a week , and i was completely okay.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Toothache,",0,0,NO,"Had a very bad experience for my first dental treatment. Visited the clinic for tooth ache and gum swelling on March 18th, Doctor immediately said RCT is required and opened my teeth. After 2 more visit also my problem persisted. After my last visit at 2nd April I asked for an appointment on 10th April. But the appointment got delayed and my appointment was scheduled on 24th April 11 am. At 9 am Doctor Priyanka Shukla Ma'am called me and asked to have a CBCT done, I got very much worried as I am having Antibiotics and painkillers for last one and half month, just before appointment I was suggested for test, I said if the test to be done it should have been informed to me earlier so that I could have come with the test report. I said I lost trust in the treatment and asked for refund, which she readily agreed and said it will be done in 14 days. After 2 days she asked me to mail with detail, after I mailed she reverted that if she has to return she will do that legally. I was shocked reading the mail that Rs 9000 I have already spent and if she has not assured me of the refund I had to stick with the smae clinic. But with her assurance of refund I visited and paid money to other clinic too.**** * ****** *** ******** ********** ***** ** ** *** ******* ******** ***** ***",2021-04-29 22:30:38,False,False,Verified Patient,"For some patients doctors are robot .
