She visited several dentists but none understood her problem precisely and could give her a solution.\r\nA visit to MSDC with Dr. Angshuman and his multi-speciality team gave us several options to go about the treatment. After trying out a Root Canal, I was pleasantly surprised that the doctor actually texted me the same night to find out how my mother was dealing with the pain. Out of the scores of patients they treat every day the doctor actually followed up with a patient.\r\nIf that was not commendable enough, MSDC impressed me yet again. Ultimately, my mother had to go for an extraction of her tooth to be replaced with an implant 3 months later. On the day of the tooth extraction, a member of MSDC's panel, Dr. Nitubrata still did his duty even though Dr. Nitubrata's wife was facing severe pain in her chest and was admitted in the ICU ward. The extraction was done painlessly and the cracked tooth came out in pieces. After extraction my mother can continue delighting on her favourite ice creams and we look forward to the implant process, as well.\r\nKudos to the focused leadership of Dr. Angshuman and the service oriented team at Mission Smile Dental Centre (MSDC).\r\n",

The doctor has a very good team of young doctors. In the first sitting my son got his teeth cleaned. A young lady doctor did it very carefully and patiently without hurting. Then another pair of young doctors patiently  took digital imagery of entire mouth cavity which is part of the procedure. I hope to receive similar care in the course of my son's treatment.  ",

Now with the grace of God and Dr. Angshuman and his awesome team, he's got an awesome smile. My younger son will also be starting treatment here.\r\nThe whole team of mission smile,  starting with Dr. Angshuman,  doctors and full staff are always courteous,  pleasant and a pleasure to talk to and be with.

Appointment ended late evening and one of the support staff stayed late only to help my dad in sitting in the cab. This shows how good mission smile support staffs are.\nAnd Dr Angshuman Ji is a doctor who offers best advice in the best interest of his patients. He is  emphatic towards his patients problems. He listened to our problem very patiently and was very understanding to our problem.\nDr Angshuman Ji one of the few, kind doctors whom I have met who is not monetarily driven but patients satisfaction driven. He is a professional with a humanly touch. \nI will recommend mission smile, especially Dr Angshuman Ji to all.\nDate of Visit -18.05.2017",

She visited several dentists but none understood her problem precisely and could give her a solution.\r\nA visit to MSDC with Dr. Angshuman and his multi-speciality team gave us several options to go about the treatment. After trying out a Root Canal, I was pleasantly surprised that the doctor actually texted me the same night to find out how my mother was dealing with the pain. Out of the scores of patients they treat every day the doctor actually followed up with a patient.\r\nIf that was not commendable enough, MSDC impressed me yet again. Ultimately, my mother had to go for an extraction of her tooth to be replaced with an implant 3 months later. On the day of the tooth extraction, a member of MSDC's panel, Dr. Nitubrata still did his duty even though Dr. Nitubrata's wife was facing severe pain in her chest and was admitted in the ICU ward. The extraction was done painlessly and the cracked tooth came out in pieces. After extraction my mother can continue delighting on her favourite ice creams and we look forward to the implant process, as well.\r\nKudos to the focused leadership of Dr. Angshuman and the service oriented team at Mission Smile Dental Centre (MSDC).\r\n",

The doctor has a very good team of young doctors. In the first sitting my son got his teeth cleaned. A young lady doctor did it very carefully and patiently without hurting. Then another pair of young doctors patiently  took digital imagery of entire mouth cavity which is part of the procedure. I hope to receive similar care in the course of my son's treatment.  ",

His attitude and confidence makes you feel secure, giving you a feeling of coming to the right place.  His team of doctors at mission smile are excellent. \r\nMy elder son, now 15, was treated for braces here. He did not have any problem whatsoever, no blisters,no pain and no swelling. Now with the grace of God and Dr. Angshuman and his awesome team, he's got an awesome smile. My younger son will also be starting treatment here.\r\nThe whole team of mission smile,  starting with Dr. Angshuman,  doctors and full staff are always courteous,  pleasant and a pleasure to talk to and be with.  Reminders are given for appointments, and changes are accommodated. \r\nI wish Dr. Angshuman another entire team at mission smile all the best always!  Keep smiling! :-) ",

Appointment ended late evening and one of the support staff stayed late only to help my dad in sitting in the cab. This shows how good mission smile support staffs are.\nAnd Dr Angshuman Ji is a doctor who offers best advice in the best interest of his patients. He is  emphatic towards his patients problems. He listened to our problem very patiently and was very understanding to our problem.\nDr Angshuman Ji one of the few, kind doctors whom I have met who is not monetarily driven but patients satisfaction driven. He is a professional with a humanly touch. \nI will recommend mission smile, especially Dr Angshuman Ji to all.\nDate of Visit -18.05.2017",

But as my treatment started my dentist Dr. Angshuman made the procedure very comfortable and relaxed. I had varied problems which was dealt by specialised doctors ( Dr. Nitubrata and Dr. Suman). It was a painless treatment and went very smoothly. The staff specially Arunda and Poornima were very cooperative and always there to attend. The music lightens the stress in your mind. Lastly u just need to visit here once and they also give reminders for your appointments and ensures good health for your teeth. They are very particular with the timings and work by appointments. That's the best part I liked. Apart from the treatment they emphasise on proper brushing and flossing for prevention. Mission Smile's main mission is to give u a healthy teeth and beautiful smile. So if you are looking for a dentist then this is the right place.",

He got a team of doctors together- all of them are experts in their field- to address my concerns. He identified problems that dental doctors in US failed to identify. My crown for root canal was delivered within couple days and so was my customized mouth guard. And on the top, he took time to explain all the problems for me to understand and didn't overwhelm/insists me with procedures I didn't need. Very happy with the experience. Highly recommend-  and I'd definitely consult him again when I'm back in town. ",

For your information its a normal protocol worldwide to get your child's routine Orthodontic Check up done  before age 7 years on a 6 monthly basis. We do that and lots of other Orthodontic treatment for kids as early as 5 yearsin Mission Smile. We assessed your child's cavity as a chief complaint and also educated  you that it should be done by a pediatric dentist and not by any of the 12 specialist dentist in our main branch who also treat cavities. Moreover a dentist is not trained to handle the pschological management which is required to give a pleasant first time experience to a young child while treating him. Pedodontists are trained to manage the emotional component of the child during treatment.  We gave you an unbiased honest opinion. And this is because cavity preparation of milk teeth is technique sensitive and different from adult teeth which most patients dont realise and they just come looking for a dentist. You had come searching for a Dentist but we checked your child and gave you the right guidance to go to a Pedodontist. Also we definitely checked his bite and did a timely Orthodontic assessment of his teeth which you as a parent should be aware of. There are some children who come to us for this Ortho dentistry at a very late age and we find hidden cross bites with growth deficiencies of their jaw which cannot be corrected then. So good that you got your child screened for crossbites and underbites which could always be unwantedly present in thier teeth. Your money definitely didnt go to waste. For cavities of milk teeth most parents donot even know the fact that it should be treated by a Pedodontist. And we rightly referred you to our Pediatric Wing. Anyways Cavities are never filled for a very young child on the very first day. Thats a protocol to gain his confidence in a new environment. So time is something you have to invest when its your own child!",

Your Mom Mrs. Binata Naskar is a Stage 4 Cancer Patient and has undergone Radiation therapy. She is extremely fragile and susceptible to infections. So it was my duty and responsibilty to immediately involve a Periodontist and Geriatric dentist who is specialised to handle such cases. Since he was fortunately present that day i thought it would be apt to show her to him immediately as this is his field where he has 15 years of experience. I being the Director of the Centre am in a better position to understand which patient should be seen by which specialist. You took all the suggestions and we answered all your queries and even gave her the required medicines and planned for future treatment. Never did you once complain about any negligence on our part and also were mutually discussing with your mother about the dates for future treatment. Then how come all of a sudden totally out of the blue you make such defamatory remarks that too on social media to a doctor who has been compassionate and was trying to provide you the best speciality service. \nTruly amazed by your dual behaviour.\nBest regards\nDr. Angshuman Bhattacharya\nDirector \nMission Smile",

If completion of Covid19 safety declaration came across as being rude to you then you should understand that its a social responsibilty of all to speak the truth. We hope that we could give respite to your mother from acute pain by providing the services in this hour of crisis by taking special permits to travel and come in for this.
