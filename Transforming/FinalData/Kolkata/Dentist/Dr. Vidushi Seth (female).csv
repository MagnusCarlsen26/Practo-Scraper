"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,NO,"Grew impatient with my questions and trying to understand the process... Was told""most people just want straight teeth, they don't have so many questions about the procedure""

After this being my third appointment and I still didn't have clarity on the process or procedure it was about time I had a fuller picture. She didn't like all the questions. And left the room. Without saying goodbye or thank you or have a good day.

I wish her well in her practice. She is young and clearly has a lot to learn when it comes to customer service. ",2022-04-16 11:47:00,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
