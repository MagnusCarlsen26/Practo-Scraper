Dr Soham is not only a thorough professional but also a gentle soul. He has a state of art dental studio and uses the latest techniques and dental materials prevalent in the world. The staff employed  in the studio is very professional and  courteous. I wish him and his team of expert doctors and staff a very fulfilling and a rewarding future. His team has brought smiles to numerous faces including mine. Kudos and thanks a ton. Highly highly recommended !!",

He also taught me the basics of keeping my tooth healthy, and gave me a free toothbrush. i came to know since long i was not taking care of my teeth but now i will be taking care of it. I am happy I went to Doctor Soham Chatterjee who is a great dentist and will recommend a must visit for any dental problem. ",

Dr Soham is not only a thorough professional but also a gentle soul. He has a state of art dental studio and uses the latest techniques and dental materials prevalent in the world. The staff employed  in the studio is very professional and  courteous. I wish him and his team of expert doctors and staff a very fulfilling and a rewarding future. His team has brought smiles to numerous faces including mine. Kudos and thanks a ton. Highly highly recommended !!",

As a specialist I was asked to attend to an urgent case which had come to the clinic and needed my expertise, as a result of which a senior doctor had taken over your case ensuring your comfort at the same time maintaining the treatment quality. We made sure that quality treatment was provided to you and I am a bit surprised that after the treatment I personally came and checked you again. You were satisfied with the treatment then. If you have any complaints regarding the treatment done do let us know we shall take care of it. The treatment at Aesthetica has been of high quality and we try our best to ensure patient comfort and care.",

We are a state of the art clinic trying never to compromise on our patient's quality of work. You wanted us to give you good work at a very minimal charge as per your liking which is not possible as we do send work to one of the premium labs in the country and every work is being done by specialists to give you the best results. We also still tried our best to help you by not charging you for the xray and also giving you discounts from our side which we dont usually do. You did love our work when we showed you our previous patient results. The charges you bargained for is not acceptable to our work quality and standards. We are there to help you out nonetheless. We do our best to do help our patients, but there has to be a limit. It's also unfair to the doctors when patient's put us down because of unfair requests such as this. \nThank you.",
