,,0,0,YES,"It's really amazing . I am 71 years now. Prior to my having extraction this time on 13th instant , I had very painful experience earlier with other dental surgeons so far as extraction is concerned. Fortunately I could get in touch with Dr. J. Chakraborty this time with the help of my son-in-law . I express my deep gratitude towards Dr. J. Chakraborty for the treatment that he had done to relieve me from my intense pain . Today (22/10/22) just half an hour ago Dr. Chakraborty set my denture and it's perfect . Thanks to Dr. Chakraborty.",2022-10-22 09:46:30,False,True,Kishalay Gangopadhyay,,,
,,0,0,YES,A one of a kind experience. I was stuck in Europe with a simple dental problem that those doctors were not able to diagnose. I consulted him on a VC. He simply asked me 5 questions and determined the root cause within 5 minutes and prescribed medication which immediately gave positive results. That's how a doctor should be. Experience Speaketh. Did my tooth extraction and also my pedodontitis cured from him. Simply a super experience. ,2021-02-20 10:53:10,False,True,ABHISHEK SINHA ROY,"Thank you so much for your kind words.This indeed motivates us to treat our patients with more passion and integrity.
