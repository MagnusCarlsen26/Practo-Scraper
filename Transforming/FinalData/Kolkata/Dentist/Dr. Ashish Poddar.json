The next day when you came for suture removal your same friend came again for chit chatting, so my staff and I objected. If this is impolite, then it's ok for me. Let people read this, they will decide by themselves. Also you should learn how to behave with female staff. So as a patient bring someone to clinic who does eat gutka and khaini like your friend.
