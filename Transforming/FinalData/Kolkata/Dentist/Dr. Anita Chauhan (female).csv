First of all I seriously apologize that our conversation did not satisfy your expectations. Madam we set a high standard for ourselves and are truly sorry to hear from you. 
I must assure you that our patients happiness and wellbeing is our first priority. 
Coming to the issue, you said that your son had a boil on the top left corner of tooth. First of all you need to understand the cause of boil which is actually an abscess due to a grossly decayed left upper back tooth. This generally happens due to poor oral hygiene and oral care negligence. 
After seeing your older prescription from some other clinic you had visited it was clear that the child had already taken multiple course of antibiotics. And please understand that only giving medicine without treatment of the concerned tooth will not benefit the child. 
So the options left with us were either keep the tooth by doing pulpectomy but without crown as the tooth was in a very bad condition. By doing this the tooth can again develop an abscess. 
Moreover long standing grossly decayed tooth could result in an infectious insult to the permanent tooth bud which would cause hypomineralization of permanent enamel. The other option is remove the milk tooth and give a space maintainer. 
I have tried to explain you the case. Feel free to contact me anytime for any further discussion. Please reach me personally via email or phone and  I would be more than happy to discuss the issue at your earliest convenience.
