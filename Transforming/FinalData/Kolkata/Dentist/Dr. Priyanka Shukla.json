After my last visit at 2nd April I asked for an appointment on 10th April. But the appointment got delayed and my appointment was scheduled on 24th April 11 am. At 9 am Doctor Priyanka Shukla Ma'am called me and asked to have a CBCT done, I got very much worried as I am having Antibiotics and painkillers for last one and half month, just before appointment I was suggested for test, I said if the test to be done it should have been informed to me earlier so that I could have come with the test report. I said I lost trust in the treatment and asked for refund, which she readily agreed and said it will be done in 14 days. After 2 days she asked me to mail with detail, after I mailed she reverted that if she has to return she will do that legally. I was shocked reading the mail that Rs 9000 I have already spent and if she has not assured me of the refund I had to stick with the smae clinic. But with her assurance of refund I visited and paid money to other clinic too.**** * ****** *** ******** ********** ***** ** ** *** ******* ******** ***** ***",

After my last visit at 2nd April I asked for an appointment on 10th April. But the appointment got delayed and my appointment was scheduled on 24th April 11 am. At 9 am Doctor Priyanka Shukla Ma'am called me and asked to have a CBCT done, I got very much worried as I am having Antibiotics and painkillers for last one and half month, just before appointment I was suggested for test, I said if the test to be done it should have been informed to me earlier so that I could have come with the test report. I said I lost trust in the treatment and asked for refund, which she readily agreed and said it will be done in 14 days. After 2 days she asked me to mail with detail, after I mailed she reverted that if she has to return she will do that legally. I was shocked reading the mail that Rs 9000 I have already spent and if she has not assured me of the refund I had to stick with the smae clinic. But with her assurance of refund I visited and paid money to other clinic too.**** * ****** *** ******** ********** ***** ** ** *** ******* ******** ***** ***",
