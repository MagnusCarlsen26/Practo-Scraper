You come smiling and go back laughing.  Her behavior is something to learn from. When you are in the clinic you realise how much you can learn from her to be humble. Hardly I have come across Doctors who are so humble. Hope she remains like this when she is little older. I had a long treatment almost 7 months,  never once I felt pain. They have wobderful team of staff to assist. The staff is also so wellbehaved. I can go on writing about her treatment .I recommend her 200 % times . I pray that she has a 10 times bigger clinic so that whe can see more patient. As the only drawback is this clinic has less space. But I would be her patient for my lifetime. She has another wonderful wonderful doctor Dr Akshay, Who is another magician doctor of next level. He did my decay removal and filing without an injection, only a Doctor of extraordinary knowledge and good hands can do it.  They use all the best stuff which is available and are extremely careful for the hygiene.  Then they have the Super Boss Dr , Dr Ankit Khandelwal who is what not. He is extremely extremely knowledgeable and manages the clinic in a Top Class Manner.I can go on and on to describe my experience there. But I want to keep it short. Not only so Even if you visit them several times because of your treatment they never complain or frawn.  God bless them. ",

You come smiling and go back laughing.  Her behavior is something to learn from. When you are in the clinic you realise how much you can learn from her to be humble. Hardly I have come across Doctors who are so humble. Hope she remains like this when she is little older. I had a long treatment almost 7 months,  never once I felt pain. They have wobderful team of staff to assist. The staff is also so wellbehaved. I can go on writing about her treatment .I recommend her 200 % times . I pray that she has a 10 times bigger clinic so that whe can see more patient. As the only drawback is this clinic has less space. But I would be her patient for my lifetime. She has another wonderful wonderful doctor Dr Akshay, Who is another magician doctor of next level. He did my decay removal and filing without an injection, only a Doctor of extraordinary knowledge and good hands can do it.  They use all the best stuff which is available and are extremely careful for the hygiene.  Then they have the Super Boss Dr , Dr Ankit Khandelwal who is what not. He is extremely extremely knowledgeable and manages the clinic in a Top Class Manner.I can go on and on to describe my experience there. But I want to keep it short. Not only so Even if you visit them several times because of your treatment they never complain or frawn.  God bless them. ",
