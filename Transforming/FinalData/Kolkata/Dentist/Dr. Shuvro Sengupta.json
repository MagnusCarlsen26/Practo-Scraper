I went to see Dr. Sengupta after my previous doctor could not get me out of pain . I was in pain and another nurse at work told me about Dr. Sengupta .It was instantly apparent how professional and knowledgeable he is. He immediately calmed my anxiety just by how he was. He was patient, took the time to explain everything and was so attentive to everything he was doing. My anxiety level was off the charts knowing I needed a root canal and he made this procedure easy. Within a few hours, I stopped feeling any pain or after effects from the procedure. Based on my experience, my conclusion is that Dr. Sengupta is an excellent doctor.  Many things can cause pain in the mouth and face, but if it is related to the tooth and the patients needs a root canal, I have 100% confidence that Dr. Sengupta will fix it.\nI will not go to anyone else and I am so very grateful for finding him.",

Not only does he have a ton of experience *** ********* in his field, he was able to relay all of that back to me as a patient in a thorough and reassuring way.\n\nI got all 4 wisdom teeth removed in one visit here which made me quite nervous. But the process was so efficient and he made me very comfortable the entire time. He gave detailed after care instructions and I was actually really shocked at how easy the recovery was for me. It was completely painless and I was ready to go back to work shortly after.\n\nI can say with 100% certainty that I will be returning to Dr Sengupta for any of my dental needs in the future. The amount of consideration he gave for my individual situation and the quality of care that he provides is just unmatched.\n\nI strongly advise going to Dr.Sengupta for wisdom teeth (or any procedure for that matter). I had an amazing experience here and really appreciated the treatment. **** *** **** ** *** **** *** **** ** ********* *** ** ** ******* *** ******* \n\nThank you for the swift and gentle work Dr. Sengupta you are truly a master of your craft!

It's a lovely practice and I felt like I was in excellent professional hands. \nDr Sengupta's initial diagnosis had been spot on, and the two sessions i had with him were literally painless. So much so that on both my visits i fell asleep during the treatment. I can't give any higher or more heartfelt praise than that.\nEven the injection to numb which is very often painful and leaking as it\u2019s put in was unbelievably smooth ,slow as if he had all day and not rushed and virtually pain free ..One could actually look forward to a next visit knowing you are in super safe super skilled hands and somewhere where Dr gives it his all to help you hold onto your teeth and not take the quick and distressing route to save time and tell you to just pull it out .Everything possible was invested in making it a stress free and successful outcome .\nOverall, there was nothing that Dr Sengupta could have done better and thankfully my tooth is feeling excellent!",

I went to see Dr. Sengupta after my previous doctor could not get me out of pain . I was in pain and another nurse at work told me about Dr. Sengupta .It was instantly apparent how professional and knowledgeable he is. He immediately calmed my anxiety just by how he was. He was patient, took the time to explain everything and was so attentive to everything he was doing. My anxiety level was off the charts knowing I needed a root canal and he made this procedure easy. Within a few hours, I stopped feeling any pain or after effects from the procedure. Based on my experience, my conclusion is that Dr. Sengupta is an excellent doctor.  Many things can cause pain in the mouth and face, but if it is related to the tooth and the patients needs a root canal, I have 100% confidence that Dr. Sengupta will fix it.\nI will not go to anyone else and I am so very grateful for finding him.",

Dr Sengupta replaced 6 crowns of mine which another dentist had mutilated, and the result was so perfectly molded and carefully positioned in my mouth that it feels like natural teeth.  I am very lucky to have found him.\nHis skill is impeccable. He is a dedicated doctor who has an unending enthusiasm for his profession . His professionalism, his care factor and his patience are the reason you should never have to look elsewhere. I\u2019m so happy my friend referred me to Dr Sengupta. I am so grateful and would give him a 100 star review if it was an option. Highly recommended for people who are serious about their dental health.\nThank you for all the beautiful crowns. I wear them with pride!",

He explained all of my options and gave me all of the pros and cons of each. Very thorough! I really appreciate him giving me choices to figure out what would be best for me.Dr Sengupta made wisdom teeth extraction easy. His execution is so swift and precise that I had minimal wound on the extraction site so I was able to resume normal activities the very next day.\nI have met my fair share of bad experiences , so I feel obligated and confident to say that the treatment here is professional and impeccable. The visit with Dr Sengupta turned an otherwise daunting experience into a completely comfortable one. \nI am now the third of my friends to use this clinic for our wisdom teeth extractions and we all highly recommend - Dr Shuvro Sengupta. \n",

It's a lovely practice and I felt like I was in excellent professional hands. \nDr Sengupta's initial diagnosis had been spot on, and the two sessions i had with him were literally painless. So much so that on both my visits i fell asleep during the treatment. I can't give any higher or more heartfelt praise than that.\nEven the injection to numb which is very often painful and leaking as it\u2019s put in was unbelievably smooth ,slow as if he had all day and not rushed and virtually pain free ..One could actually look forward to a next visit knowing you are in super safe super skilled hands and somewhere where Dr gives it his all to help you hold onto your teeth and not take the quick and distressing route to save time and tell you to just pull it out .Everything possible was invested in making it a stress free and successful outcome .\nOverall, there was nothing that Dr Sengupta could have done better and thankfully my tooth is feeling excellent!",

The root canal was a complex one which another dentist had struggled with and left incomplete, but Dr Sengupta seems to have done a very good job of sorting it out. The treatment by Dr Sengupta was professional; it seemed like he could do this complicated procedure with his eyes closed, remaining cheerful and upbeat as he walked me through the treatment. He was incredibly meticulous with his work - retesting measurements and making sure everything was absolutely spot on. \nThe aftercare was much better than anything I\u2019ve received elsewhere, with the Dr giving me a call the day after to checkup on any after effect from the anaesthetic or treatment.",

One day in college I slipped from the stairs and broke half of one of my incisors. It was very painful and also looked very bad. I was looking for a highly qualified, understanding and dependable doctor and Dr. Shuvro Sengupta met all my needs. After talking to the doctor for the very first time I felt  very good as he  explained me what are the remedies for my pain. I had the broken half of my tooth with me. As  I had to go to  college the next day  Dr. Shuvro Sengupta perfectly managed to join that broken half  of my tooth. It looked almost natural. I was very much pleased with that.  I think that was the fastest solution possible. Then he prescribed me a root canal treatment as soon as possible. It was going good until my tooth started to pain. The pain was random and immense.  Dr. Shuvro Sengupta  told me to undergo a root canal treatment as soon as possible but I got a bit late which caused to linger my tooth pain. I went to visit Dr Shuvro Sengupta again. I went through a painless RCT. He asked me numerous times whether I was feeling uncomfortable or any sort of pain while he was performing the RCT. After that it went just fine for nearly seven months without any pain or problem until the broken half of my tooth that was temporarily fixed got detached while  I was trying to eat a  roasted corn with that teeth. That was very careless of me. Then finally I went to  visit Dr. Shuvro Sengupta again and in just two sittings my broken tooth was perfectly crowned. The crowned tooth of mine looks  totally natural and feels very good and strong. The overall experience was very good.  I am very thankful to him for providing me with such a wonderful and caring treatment. So I have got back my smile and thus my confidence . ",

I was recovering from a very critical post-covid haul when I realized that I needed some dental treatment. As his clinic is situated in the same neighbourhood where I stay; I approached him one day with little doubt on how my new dentist was going to be. After my first visit, I was convinced that I came to the right dentist as he explained what were the problems and how they could be treated. I have done two re-RCT and changed my over-sized crown of one tooth, treated pockets which was troubling me for months and without any hassle. \nDr Sengupta's clinic is clean and disabled friendly. He pays extra attention to covid protocols and keeps the space hygienic. He also uses very good quality material, and the best part is that for a curious and fussy patient like me, he explains every thing very patiently! He is very professional and as well as friendly. At one point I have thought, our country needs good doctors like him who has such sound knowledge of the profession they are in and providing services to so many citizens. \nDuring one of the sessions, which dragged for 2 months, I faced a neuro related pain. He took extra care by following up with me, recommended the right medicine and never charged me extra for follow-up consultations. Dental treatments are expensive but at the end it's worth paying if one gets a super quality treatment as provided by Dr Sengupta. I highly recommend fellow citizens and friends to consult him in case one needs a dental treatment. \nI must say this as a queer rights activist, I have felt extremely comfortable and not received any biased or homophobic attitude from him which I have faced in the past from a few medical practitioners. My queer folx can approach Dr Sengupta without any inhibition or hesitation.  \nAs my dentist says, 'brush twice for 2 minutes and keep smiling', that's the secret behind a happy and healthy face \ud83d\ude42\nStay safe and see your dentist once a year! \nRainbow love!

I was nurturing a painful tooth,  was avoiding treatment and relying \non painkillers. Then I visited a few clinics and was suggested rct and crowns. Likewise I went to Dr Sengupta for another opinion. He performed tests on my tooth (biting down/hot-cold, etc.) and determined that I did in fact need to have a root canal. But his honesty and willingness to explain my problem did the trick. He also didn't try to \" sell \" crowns by using words like warranty cards. I decided then and there, I will get my treatment done from him .\n\nAfter administering injection and waiting for anesthesia to start it's effects he asked how I was feeling. He checked to make sure I was completely numb and then he gave me protective clothing. He began the procedure. I'm not sure how long I was lying there or what he was doing. My eyes were closed. I didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable. After 1 hour, he informed me he had finished 1st appointment's work . It really was not like what I was expecting. The 2nd and final appointment also went very well. I appreciate how he kept checking on how I was doing throughout the procedure. Then he explained to me the next steps: What to do and not do within the next several hours, what to take for any possible pain, how to take care of the tooth before I get my permanent crown. I left the clinic incredulous to just how seamless the experience was. \n\nHe seems to be quite experienced in his field. It's not easy mentally preparing yourself for a root canal; but he made the experience and procedure comfortable and ideal.\n\nThe dental procedure I needed took 2 appointments. I felt at every moment that I was getting the best trained and most capable medical care.\n\n",

The tooth had to be removed as it was deemed to be in a very bad state. Upon discussion, he decided not to place an implant on the same day as there was considerable infection around the tooth. Rather, he did an ingenious thing by placing graft material in that place which resulted in no bone loss. 3 weeks later , he retreated the back molar which had rct years ago. It was absolutely painless. The tooth became an anchor tooth for the dental bridge he placed to replace the extracted tooth. In a span of few weeks, I witnessed his superb skills in several aspects of dentistry. \nIn case if you wonder how I became so well versed with these dental terminologies, again thanks to Dr Sengupta for his God gifted talent to explain each and everything in such an easy manner.

Dr Sengupta is one of a rare breed of surgeons who has a fantastic and empathetic clinical manner in addition to his obvious expertise and technical skill. He made himself readily available throughout to address even the most minor of concerns or queries I had regarding my treatment. I felt consistently that my needs and experience as the patient were acknowledged and held in the utmost respect. During the procedure ,  Dr Sengupta was quick, dexterous, reassuring , knowledgeable and his amiable approach made what is an uncomfortable procedure at the best of times all the more tolerable. Dr Sengupta readily attended to aftercare questions in the days that followed the procedure (he is also exceptional in that he is only too happy communicate directly with his patients) and follow up care was top notch.\nI highly recommend Dr Sengupta for dentistry work and will stay with him for all future dentistry work.",

I have been pushing this surgery for years as I was not convinced by any of the multiple dental surgeons I have seen in the past until I was fortunate enough to find Dr Sengupta. The minute I met Dr Sengupta I felt I was in good hands. He is very experienced with complex dentistry. Not only has he been a fantastic support for me but my family also. Answered every question in such a calm and wonderful way that made us feel totally at ease. I can't recommend him enough if you are looking for a doctor in this space, from the second I met him I gave him my full trust and it is something I will never regret. No question too small or silly, totally supportive .He makes sure that you have realistic expectations of the recovery process and actually my recovery was a lot easier than what I expected. I would highly recommend him to anyone worried about complications from dental surgery.",

All sorted now - and, most pleasingly of all, no longer a nervous patient. \nDr Shuvro Sengupta has restored my faith and confidence in going to the dentist! I have had 14 composite fillings and 2 replacement crowns fitted and couldn\u2019t be happier with them. His work is methodical and considered - he takes the time to ensure a perfect and long lasting result, and explains everything along the way. \nI came away confident in the work that had been done and suffering no ill-effects from the procedure. An excellent and impressive service.\nMy family has now also joined based on the experience I have had. I would recommend Dr Shuvro Sengupta to anyone looking for high quality dental care.\n",

I have never received such good and comprehensive advice and information from a doctor.\nHad my root canal done by Dr Shuvro Sengupta and his friendly approach made me feel at ease. Because of past experiences at other places, I have a fear of anyone working on my teeth. He explained what was to be expected during the procedure & made me feel comfortable with all the steps. He's amazing when it comes to giving anesthetics and asked if I was in any pain throughout the procedure. Every step was always announced to me as a patient - even every noise and every sensory sensation - so that I was completely relaxed . He paused several times during the procedure to make adjustments for pain and comfort. Even before and after the actual work, I always had enough space to ask my questions and things that were important to me. \nYou will rarely find a doctor like Dr Sengupta who tries to save teeth with so much commitment and expertise. \n\nThank you Dr Sengupta for your effortless professionalism and attention to detail .

Anyway, out of all the dentists I have ever had (over 15) Dr Sengupta is the best I have experienced. P.S I really appreciate that Dr Sengupta was able to administer the anaesthetic shot without any pain. Handled my severe dental anxiety very professionally .Very considerate and understanding in explaining to me what I have going on and procedures he thinks will resolve my issues. I went to see Dr Sengupta for a root canal treatment because I had a hot tooth which is when the pulp inside a tooth swells up due to infection and presses on the nerve causing immense pain that is bad enough to give sleepless nights. Usually this means that pain is inevitable during the root canal treatment. However, what Dr Sengupta was able to do was to minimise the pain and to reassure me as much as possible so that the root canal treatment wasn\u2019t as bad an experience as I had expected. He takes the time to explain every thing clearly beforehand so that you understand what\u2019s going on each step of the way. He also warns and tells you to brace yourself before doing anything that may cause pain or discomfort. I was also impressed by his equipment, which is really high-tech.",

He pays attention to your body language and continuously checks in with you. Any discomfort is dealt with immediately, prior to moving on with the treatment. My root canal was completed in two stages and at each stage there was reassurance and care provided at all times. Despite all the nervousness, Dr Sengupta made this as painless an experience as possible. I honestly will always recommend Dr Sengupta to friends and family, so don\u2019t hesitate if you have the need for a genuinely brilliant dentist no matter how complex your issues are, don\u2019t go anywhere else! I hope this review helps even the most nervous patients feel reassured. To back up my feedback, I have a relative who\u2019s been a dentist for over 20 years, and said that the work was very well done ! Thanks doctor.",

Dr did very detailed testing using pressure and cold techniques to narrow down the tooth .In the end he said I should consider a root canal on one tooth. He walked me through the x-ray and discussed the procedure. I was back in his clinic 2 days later . My root canal was very complicated and took many hours, but he didn\u2019t flinch and did a marvellous job! After the procedure he wrote down clear instructions for every thing I needed to do from taking medicines to rinsing and cleaning my teeth as well as next steps. After my procedure, he checked up on me via text to ensure my pain had subsided and the procedure was  successful. Dr Sengupta was so amazing. He listens to you, he doesn\u2019t cut you off when you are trying to explain the pain you are going through and he gives the best reasonable option without breaking the bank. I have gone to doctors that want to do all kinds of treatments that are minor and cosmetic instead of looking at the actual preventive or actual urgent maintenance. Dr Sengupta is very attentive and follows his cases personally. This is not a large factory sort of operation that many dental clinics  have now become. He explains what he\u2019s doing,  why ,and discusses the options. I like this and expect this for high quality care.",

I did not feel the needles at all. The drilling and what not honestly wasn\u2019t that bad-not nearly  the kind of head-rattling I had experienced before. I can now eat cold food pain free. He takes the time to make sure you are fully heard, comfortable and his genuine interest in your well-being is clear. You will appreciate his meticulous and methodical approach. Dr Sengupta knows where the problem lies and goes straight to it to get you back to good health. I have never seen a doctor take such good care of his patients.

The jury is still out as to whether it will ultimately end up okay but Dr Sengupta was incredible in how he treated me. Kind, competent, and pulled no punches when it came using every tool at his disposal. He even threw in some fun analogies to make the experience light and comfortable. He walked me through the entire procedure before, during, and after so I knew what to expect and what the next steps of the healing process would be. He spent time helping me understand the pros-cons of the procedure, and I really felt like we were working together to plan my treatment. Such a breath of fresh air when you are used to just being told what to do by doctors. The combination of Dr Sengupta\u2019s love of his practice and his high skill level convey a sense of confidence that helps make this procedure far more tolerable. I had some complications for a day or so afterwards but Dr Sengupta was great in supporting me after hours with advice and helpful information. Now, three days after the procedure, I feel great and have nothing but high regards for Dr Sengupta . I strongly recommend Dr Sengupta and will be telling my friends and colleagues about his great work. ",

You will not find a doctor more honest and with a better bedside manner ! Out of all the dentists I\u2019ve had , ** ****** ******** ** *** **** **** ************ Dr Sengupta was able to retreat my root canal and successfully saved my tooth when others wanted to extract it. Dr Sengupta explained everything to me thoroughly in terms of what was going on with my tooth and the steps we would need to take to fix it. I was able to receive quick responses from him after-hours regarding some concerns and questions I had about my tooth and my facial swelling. When it came time to finally do the procedure, he was very gentle and walked me through each step of the way, explaining what he was doing and what type of sensations I would feel. He kept me informed the whole time, was very nice, patient, and answered all my questions. During the procedure, he let me know what he was doing every step of the way and approximately how long it would take. His outstanding services continued post treatment by contacting me and verifying the condition of my tooth. For many reasons , You want an understanding, kind-hearted listener of a Doctor. He is this! You want a brilliant doctor's expertise working on you. He is definitely this and more! \n",

His smile, his positive energy and calm initial interaction, and he\u2019s clear explanation about what caused that tooth pain helped calm me and helped me decide to get the procedure. While performing the procedure in his clinic, he calmly informed me how my root canal was, what percentage of procedure was finished, and how long it took, all with an encouraging, soothing tone. He is skilled, thorough and very well equipped. Exactly what you are looking for in a doctor. He was always checking in with me to make sure I was okay throughout the procedure, as well as several times after the procedure was finalised. There is no fancy, out of the place decorations in his clinic , no unnecessary machines which have no real diagnostic and prognostic value , like in some other clinics. I have been to those types of dental clinics. But the high quality of care and the all around compassion Dr Sengupta has for his patience put him far above the rest, in my book.",

Since I ignored my teeth for several years until every thing hurt, I have been to Dr Sengupta for three root canals over the last two years. Several times now , I have had emergencies  pop-up where I am in serious pain and Dr Sengupta has always been able to see me quickly and at least write a prescription for me to help with slowing down my issue, even waiving  the charges for quick consultation visits. This was a fantastic signal of actually caring. The procedures are painless and Dr Sengupta always explains what will be done and answer all of my questions .From start to finish I always feel good about the whole root canal experiences as much as one can be. Every time, by halfway into the procedure, I become calm and could have almost taken a nap. I was so comfortable even though there were intense things happening in my mouth \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude02.I highly recommend this place and there is a reason why this place is highly rated. Dr Sengupta is very articulate, thoughtful and competent. I will always choose this place if I need a procedure . ",

Dr Sengupta is straightforward about what is best for his patients. I just had 2 root canals done yesterday. I was very nervous since I\u2019ve had other root canals done with a different dentist (and it was either painful because I wasn\u2019t given enough numbing solution or it took very long), and I was anticipating it to be horrible since I needed the root canals on both teeth. This was honestly the best experience I\u2019ve ever had as far as root canals go.  The root canals were fast and I got numbed enough that I felt nothing but pressure.  \nDr Sengupta clearly takes pride in his work so you know that the quality will not only satisfy you but must also satisfy his own standards. This gave me great confidence in the work . He inspires confidence that you are getting the right treatment, he is fast, he appears to have the most current equipment, and he has a sense of humor which is much needed when going to the dentist.\nTo be honest ,  I was lowkey fangirling over him throughout most of the procedure.

Dr Sengupta operated on my teeth under local anesthesia . I followed his instructions and kept ice on my face, only ate soft food, and took my medicine on time and was not in pain at all.\nBack in January of 2021 , Dr Sengupta kind of rescued me from a dental nightmare I was going through at another clinic . The other doctor was unable to complete 2 RCTs he himself started and was postponing completion and was calling me every few days for a new session . Then I went to Dr Sengupta . There I found out that the teeth had no provisional fillings on them and were exposed to all food and oral bacteria , besides the previous doctor didn't / couldn't instrument the entire length of the teeth . Dr Sengupta not only corrected all these mistakes , he located missed canals in both these teeth . Where doctors aren't being able to perform the procedure the first time around,  Dr Sengupta is regularly correcting other doctors's mistakes . Dr Sengupta is a phenomenal doctor . ",

I was immediately impressed by his easygoing manner and approachability, but as time went on, it was evident that he was a highly competent surgeon as well. All aspects of the procedure were explored in depth before it took place so any possible anxieties were conquered.  As expected, he was the complete professional while still maintaining a light and relaxed manner during the procedure. The surgery itself went smoothly . I felt very little pain afterwards and had hardly any swelling. I was fit to return to work within the timescales advised and was completely recovered within a week. \nDr has kept in touch since then in order to monitor the results, which have been entirely successful . What could have been a scary experience turned out to be both informative and fascinating, thanks to Dr Sengupta . I \nwould definitely recommend Dr Sengupta to family and friends.\n\n",

I was searching for a great dentist and I stumbled on Dr.Shuvro's profile online and I read the reviews and I felt very safe and not afraid. So I decided to make an appointment to see him. When I got there and finally met Dr Shuvro I felt even more comfortable and we chatted like we knew each other for a long time. He listened while I explained to him how I let my teeth go and didn't visit a dentist for over 10+years. He then examined me and reassured me that he can fix my teeth. When I was done I left feeling so confident and well cared for. He let me know it was ok to call/text at any time with questions and even texted me himself to check on me later in the day. thankfully I didn\u2019t need to contact him because I had no issues. I would 1000% go back and if I knew it was this easy I would\u2019ve gotten them out sooner!\n\nI have more extraction to do. I highly recommend Dr Sengupta and I feel reassured that when it 's all done I will be able to have a broad smile on my face. I am willing to pay for the quality care that is being provided by Dr Sengupta . Thank you Dr Shuvro for being a great doctor. God's blessings to you.\n",

My father had an old problem of food getting in between multiple teeth followed by pain and bleeding from these places. He consulted few doctors and acted accordingly with undergoing treatments and medicines . But nothing gave real relief. Dr Sengupta on examining found out that my father had some fillings in some teeth which were not done properly and these were making cleaning between teeth difficult if not impossible. Dr changed these fillings in two appointments.  My mother and I were just looking at each other when we saw Dr Sengupta working . The entire SYSTEM of doing these procedures were just NEW to us . The instruments, materials and fine work being done were foreign to us. \nWe back at home later discussed and understood what sub standard treatment we had received at our previous doctors' !. \nMy veneers were done later in the same professional manner by Dr Sengupta . \nIf you want gold standard treatment ,don't think twice before visiting Dr Sengupta .

I reached out to Dr Shuvro based on the internet reviews I found and couldn't be happier with my experience there. He was able to give me a pain-free root canal.  I still can't believe that it didn't hurt.\nDr is very open to discussing options and is very thorough in explaining the entire procedure, what to expect and the assurance that you will feel comfortable while the root canal is performed. Dr listened patiently. It's immediately obvious he is a professional who hasn't forgotten the lost art of the bedside manner. His bedside manner was one of the best. I give this clinic my highest possible recommendation and would encourage anyone who needs dental treatment l to contact Dr Shuvro immediately.\n",

I have unfortunately had many root canals over the years with many different doctors and my experience at Dr Shuvro's clinic has set the bar for me for how it should be done both from a clinical perspective as well as his recommendations for pain management.\n The thing I admire the most about him is his obsession with learning and refining his craft. he's always trying to figure out the better way to do something \u2013 certainly a quality I appreciate. Generous with his time and availability. \nIf we could grade ten stars to show how impressed we were, would gladly do so.\nI have referred all my friends and family to him.  He is a true professional with impeccable ethics! ",

I was quite apprehensive about the procedure due to the fact that my previous dentist did not want to do it due to complications which could occur. Dr Sengupta was very compassionate and gave a very thorough explanation of the procedure.While we were waiting for the anesthetic to do its work, doctor talked to me in such a relaxed manner it was hard for me not to relax. It was not an \"I'm talking to you because it is part of my job\" conversation. I want to thank him for turning what for me was at first a panicky situation to one that had very little stress. The doctor performed the surgery, which was almost pain free, with no complications. I went through a very painful week prior to my surgery and I was in a lot of pain when I went in. Kudos to the doctor despite the condition I was in for making my visit such a very pleasant experience to say the least. I would recommend this place and especially Dr. Sengupta to anyone! Thank you so much. I am looking forward now to my road to recovery!!! I love seeing people love what they do and do it well!!",

He is a difficult patient to treat. Due to the current  Covid 19 situation, I was hesitant to venture out with my father. But he couldn't eat because of the growth on his gum. 4 other doctors, sort of refused to work on him citing his medical history.  Last Sunday, we went to Dr Sengupta for consultation. He was polite. He diagnosed the problem just by looking at it. He said the growth was called PYOGENIC GRANULOMA and is caused by tartar accumulation. Today at 9:30 am we came for the treatment. We are stunned to see the result. He removed the growth in maybe 20 seconds and removed 3 adjacent teeth in just 10-15 min. It was painless. It has been 5 hours, till now father hasn't reported any pain.\nI have been to several dentists in my life. Dr Sengupta stands out from the rest. I love the attention to detail and the quality of service he provides is outstanding.",

Dr. Sengupto provides you instructions of everything you need to do explicitly! I never had an infection, I followed everything he recommended. What impressed me the most was how thoughtful and available he was post-operation. He checked-in every couple of days to make sure that I was recovering nicely and if I had any questions or concerns. He had always made himself available to answer my questions quickly and patiently via WhatsApp. \nHe has certainly set the bar high for any doctor I see from now on!!!  The level of dedication that he has towards his patients is unparalleled. I don't think I'll find another doctor that's like him. I'm still recovering and I'm pretty confident that I will be back to normal soon. \n",

Dr Sengupta works very well, light light hands, I didn\u2019t feel anything!! I actually scheduled a second visit for next week for a second root canal with him. Dr. Sengupta should teach others how to administer anesthesia to others, because I did not feel that needle. I have never had a doctor ( himself ) call me at home to check on me . Dr Sengupta did just that. That's the kind of doctor I send my family to. He has  definitely earned all of his five stars . ",

He checked every few minutes to validate that I was comfortable. The entire more than one hour experience was painless. \nAnesthesia is another aspect of dental treatment so many fear...Dr Sengupta again walks you through every moment with reassurance. \nI feel it is so important to acknowledge Drs that are outstanding! We need more doctors like Dr Sengupta in the world. ",

He extracted 2 teeth of mine, and throughout the process he was not only flawlessly doing his job, but also he made sure that I don't panic, which is quite normal in dental cases, hence he kept on talking about other stuffs, just like friend to friend. He did the same thing while he implanted a bridge.\n\nA doctor par excellence. I recommend every patient suffering from any dental problem to visit Dr. Shuvro Sengupta at his clinic at Kestopur.",

I went to see him regarding a root canal that was done 15 years ago by a different doctor and caused some infection. It was smooth and felt no pain. Aside from that, and the reason for my review is that Dr Sengupta was extremely diligent and thorough. All throughout. Which is something I value immensely and I value more than anything else.  I cannot imagine having this type of dental treatment done anywhere else or by anyone else.",

There was no pain in the whole process. Even before the anesthetic is applied, a superficial anesthesia is applied before the real anesthetic is administered. \nThe treatment approach is always pragmatic and risk based so you aren't spending unnecessary money on procedures not needed.  That the whole treatment was also transparently priced, and that I, the most nervous of patients, got through the whole procedure with virtually no pain and absolutely no trauma made it worth every penny, and for that he has my thanks, respect and total recommendation.",

What makes Dr Sengupta an excellent doctor, a cut above the rest is his ability to help the patient envision what is about to be done. As if I were a peer, Dr Sengupta explained what I can expect over the next 30 odd minutes .   I traveled a distance to get to his clinic, but it was well worth it. Dr Sengupta's  personality, knowledge, patient-friendly approach and skills as an dental surgeon proved to be outstanding. For all of these reasons, I would recommend his services without reservation . \n\n\n",

Dr Sengupta was able to find the problem and addressed it quickly. He showed me everything that was not ok and I couldn't believe how bad the original job was done. After retreatment, I saw that my root canals turned out much better (in terms of filling and cleaning the root) than they were originally. I just wish I came to Dr Sengupta the first place all those years ago! \n \nYesterday my brother had to go in for a possible root canal. But because he hasn't had any pain for the last few days and Dr didn\u2019t see anything, he said to wait a couple of months and let\u2019s follow up so he doesn\u2019t have to do work that is unnecessary. SO SUPER appreciative that he isn't in it just for the money. He is truly there for the patient.",

The tooth was removed and I was then given stitches in my mouth - again no pain and was kept up to date throughout the procedure.\n A contact number  was provided to call if there were any problems.  After care was discussed and the ability to be in contact anytime if I needed anything was incredible.    The treatment was top class. \nHe is the gold standard that others should follow. ",

Dr Sengupta must have magic in his hands because I barely bled and I\u2019m not swollen at all!! Prompt and efficient, and seems very skilled compared to others I have used. Doctor's polite behaviour made the whole experience practically a pleasant one. \nI highly recommend Dr Shuvro Sengupta to anybody who needs dental treatment. \n5 stars!\n\n\n\n\n",

It would trigger an intense pain . Couldn't eat properly for past few days . Dr Sengupta advised RCT if I wished to save the tooth from removal . From past experiences I knew it would be difficult to anesthetize the tooth because of severe pain . But Dr Sengupta numbed the tooth and surrounding areas so easily, as if it was nothing for him . The procedure was naturally PAINLESS . It was so pain-free that I dozed off several times during procedure and Dr had to call my name to wake me up . His instructions were very detailed and didn't  leave me with any doubt. \nDr Sengupta is alot ahead than other doctors. \n I recommend him wholeheartedly.  ",

I\u2019ve had at least 10 root canals in my life due to negligence on my part as a child so I consider myself an expert patient. Dr Sengupta is hands down one of the best practitioners have ever had!!! The doc is respectful and calm and does his job very well. \nToo bad he fixed me up because I wouldn't mind going back.",

Very friendly doctor, explains the problem in details, provides accurate treatment, prescribes accurate medication/oral hygiene methods and products.

He completed the procedure in just 2 appointments . The entire procedure was absolutely painless.  2 days back the crown was put on the tooth . The crown was satisfactory too. Now I can say I can't even tell you what tooth it was that was worked on .\n\n He also extracted one of my upper wisdom teeth which was hurting a lot few months back .He  gave an explanation of my problem, a detailed care plan since I had a large sinus space as seen on xrays .   I also received a phone call the day after the surgery to make sure I was feeling ok .I also like the text message reminders of my appointment date and time - very efficient communication .I highly recommendhim for all of your dental needs.",

And prescribed me some medicines which worked very well \r\n I returned after 3 days as suggested . He extracted the tooth in a painless way . He talked to me all the time to ease my anxiety .

He gave me all the post extraction suggestions which i followed . The site of extraction healed within 1 week .

But, I found his treatment very effective and with long lasting results. He does his work very well and has very good hands. I did not feel much pain and he always cautioned me about it when necessary. He did RCT in my sensitive tooth in two sittings and his follow up medicines work very well. He charges reasonably . I went back to him for a bridge , 2 months ago and it looks more natural than my other bridges done from another well known clinic. I recently had scaling done by him and it feels very good! I highly recommend him.",

I consulted him in December 2021 about very severe pain in my wisdom tooth and hypersensitivity in one of my premolars. Dr Shuvro has easily solved both my issues quite easily, in the form of extraction of my wisdom tooth and root canal treatment in the sensitive tooth.  Both the procedures were done on the same day. I experienced nearly zero pain after the procedures and have been well cared for after the treatment completion. I sincerely appreciate his treatment and advise all to consult him for your dental issues and seek treatment from him . ** ** * **** ******* *************",

A quality doctor that is very very hard to find. He made himself available to me for any problems or concerns that I might have and followed up personally by phone the next day to make sure I was OK and that there were no problems. The fee was a BARGAIN considering the time spent,  quality of work done and immediate pain relief. Dr takes great pride in his work and takes the time to make sure it is done correctly. He did a fantastic job fixing my tooth. I am now pain-free. I would highly recommend Dr Sengupta. ",

The whole time Dr Shuvro's gentle voice was calming and walked me through it all -- including warning me if an injection would be more painful than the first etc. because of the sensitivity of the roof of my mouth. I never felt blind-sighted during the process. \nAs far as the procedure goes I was more apprehensive than I needed to be.  He gave me several injections for numbing the area and the only thing I felt was the pressure.  I didn\u2019t have any ill effects afterwards just a little tenderness in the jawbone.  I left the clinic after the surgery and went shopping. I would recommend Dr Shuvro Sengupta for anyone who needs wisdom tooth extraction.\n",

Appreciate the fact dentist kept checking to make sure I was alright as he performed a root canal, took impressions and capped it... Overall I am satisfied with the services received and will not be seeing any other dentist as long as this clinic is in existence.\n",

I truly appreciated that and exchanged several more messages inquiring about this and that.  I would highly recommend him to anyone who requires any type of dental treatment.  Not only is he such a skilled doctor, but he also has a keen ability to break down complex dental terminology and translate them to make it really easy to understand.  Dr. Sengupta is a pro. He explains the procedure clearly and answers all your questions without a hint of impatience  .I had no problems. I know if I had problems I could have called him and gotten a fast and thorough response. \n",

Such an obvious major difference in the quality of service that I have been getting from other doctors . His manner is always so cheerful, and you can tell he genuinely and truly cares about his patients -- which shows upon any return visit when he is able to easily recall whatever bedside banter you might have shared months ago.\nNothing fancy about the location. But the clinic is well equipped and clean. \nIf you are looking for a doctor that cares for his patients and does the best dentistry hands down this is the clinic for you!\n",

This resonated with me and assured me that he was looking out for my best interests, not his.  Each visit, I asked dozens of questions to Dr . He patiently answered each of one of them.\nAt the end of each visit, I always expected to have an extra bill. It never happened. Dr.  said that I paid for the treatment, not for the number of visits. He also recommended me some oral hygiene techniques.\n",

Also done scaling on the same day.The tooth extraction was done with anasthesia and it was mostly painless. scaling has been done nicely even from under the gums and looks very clean now.Overall he gives plenty of information which many doctors refrain discussing with patients.Highly satisfied and would definitely recommend anyone visiting him.The chamber is only a 3 minutes walk from Keshtopur bus stop. The chamber is clean. Only suggestion  - As scaling and tooth extraction may take sometime, a washroom to use would have been a good addition for people going through slightly lengthy procedure. ",

Now the tooth that was giving me constant issues is back to normal and looking better than before.  I had to have a small hole drilled through my existing crown to receive the root canal treatment.

The procedure was quick, painless and smoother than expected as the tooth to be extracted was cracked.

Dr. Sengupta's diagnosis gave me the peace of mind I have not gotten anywhere else. He was thoughtful about the treatments he recommended.  He happens to have a friendly but yet professional way with his patients.  His ability to explain the procedure and make a patient comfortable is an art!\n\nYesterday I had a tooth extraction performed by Dr. Sengupta. I was so impressed by how well the procedure went, but also by the kind and considerate care prior to and after the surgery. \n",

He walked me through the options that I had for that tooth and the pros and cons of each. He also talked to me about what might happen during the procedure and how we could handle each of those scenarios. He saved that tooth at the end through 3 different procedures. It took multiple sittings. Prices are actually very fair, especially for the quality of treatment and level of expertise you're receiving. ",

I am well aware about dental treatments as I have never shied away from them and visited doctors whenever needed , but I wasnt familiar with most of the things he wAs doing  , such was the difference between him and the others .

One of these was an empty shell that exposed the root, the other but a broken stub missing more than half of the tooth.  It was decided that the final decision as to whether or not one or both of the bad teeth would be extracted would rest with the doctor based on whether or not anything was saveable.\nI received a very pleasant surprise. Both teeth were preserved. The hollow one had been cleaned, treated and filled, but even more surprisingly, the badly damaged peg next to it had been completely reconstructed and was unrecognisable from before. As I didn\u2019t want to go down the implant path, it is as good as would ever be possible under the circumstances, and this was all due to the great skill of the doctor. The other tooth though is a wonder, I had thought it was unsalvageable, but he made it as good as new, this factor alone more than justified the expense-\nwhich was less than what implant would have been. \n\nA friend in the form of a dentist - he is professional, polite & extremely personable. Although I dont live in that area I will travel as far as I have to in order to continue treatment with Dr Sengupta.",

He\u2019s calm, steady, easy to talk with . I immediately went online to educate myself further on both root canals and Dr Sengupta. \nAfter reading the reviews left behind by past patients, I felt lucky to have found Dr Sengupta  . All the reviews held true, the fact that he was so friendly and considerate blew away my expectations.  I believe that he has set the bar high for any future root canals I may get done. \nI had read that root canals could take up to two hours, that root canals performed on the back teeth were trickier due to the location, and post-treatment can cause aches in the affected area. With Doctor Sengupta behind the wheel, I was in and out give or take 40-50 minutes, he was able to perform the root canal with no trouble (at least from my perspective), and with the numbing medicine worn off I have not felt pain or aches since the treatment. In my opinion, it was due to the tremendous skills of Doctor Sengupta that I was able to come out with a smile.\nHe was EXTREMELY patient with me the entire time. Only if I knew about him before I would not had my other tooth pulled. I highly recommend him . \n",

Not only does he have a ton of experience and knowledge in his field, he was able to relay all of that back to me as a patient in a thorough and reassuring  way. The amount of consideration he gave for my individual situation and the quality of care that he provided is just unmatched. However, despite the fact my lower jaw is notoriously hard to anaesthetise, on no occasion have I felt anything other than confidence. What is more, despite the nature of the various procedures I have undergone, I have experienced essentially no swelling and no post- surgical discomfort of any sort either. Dr Sengupta is an excellent communicator  as well as being a brilliant dental surgeon, which adds to the experience.",

He ensures that his patients feel as though they are the only ones that matter in this world. I personally wasn\u2019t incredibly nervous, but he was clearly used to working with people who are and had a bunch of techniques for helping them through it. He told me every thing he was going to do and  said to me if I do experience any pain please let him know and he will stop and help me in preventing any pain.

I recently went through an accident as a result of which 5 teeth broke right at the gum level and were constantly paining and 3 teeth became painful on biting.My gums were swollen and became very soft.He was the first doctor we went to. He took a lot of time to examine my whole situation and tried to explain to my parents what had happened and what can be done to save the broken teeth and treat my injured gums .He prescribed medicines and an OPG. He even asked us to consult more doctors if we had any doubts. This alone shows his good intent , his ethics . He never said for once the whole time anything about extraction of the broken teeth . However we went to 3 more doctors , 2 doctors said the teeth were unsalvageable . And one said the same thing as Dr Shuvro but it was very expensive for us . We went back to Dr Sengupta after 1 week and throughout the next 6 days he literally gave his all to save my teeth . He asked for consent before every procedure and didnt do anything which was not very necessary . Now 2 months later all those teeth are functioning perfectly . I wont say anything about his skills and whether the treatment was painful or not. I just know he did everything he could . \nI will advise all dental patients to visit him once .",

Dr Sengupta did root canal treatment in 6 front  teeth and placed tooth colored  crowns which just changed my looks . I next I will have 6 crowns placed in my lower front teeth. I am very grateful to Dr Sengupta.  I felt he treated my case with as much precision  as possible. Thousand thanks to him.\n ",

I am now glad that i visited him .I am very happy with the root canal therapy done in sensiv dental clinic . The clinic is very neat and clean. Dr sengupta is the nicest doctor i have come across . He treated us like friends. The doctor was explaining to me the reason behind every step while performing the steps, i think to ease my fears. The equipments he used were updated as i later checked them out in youtube . He paused frequently stopped to ask me how i was doing. I noticed he changed his gloves twice during the entire procedure and aviided touching anything other than his instruments.  The complete pricedure was completed in 2 hours with very negligible disfomfort. I have only suggestion that Dr sengupta should advertise his clinic more so that people get to know about him and avail such a great facility . ",

I want to thank Dr Sengupta for ensuring that the whole procedure was pain free!! I was super nervous and have very low pain tolerance. Dr Sengupta had sensed that I was anxious and gave me plenty of encouragement and assurance. He also sprayed numbing spray even before he injected  the anesthetic solution so I didn\u2019t feel a thing!  He checks in with you and answers any question you might have on WhatsApp. \n\nA big thank you to Dr Shuvro Sengupta for the wonderful help throughout these years . ",

I decided to get treatment one tooth at a time. Dr Sengupta treated the more painful tooth first.  The treatment experience was very good as the pain went away.  This was in April of this year . last week the other tooth which was yet to be treated turned painful. This time I went to another doctor on recommendation from my office colleague. After first sitting there, when I returned home I immediately realized the massive difference between the two doctors. I returned to Dr Sengupta to get the process completed. Dr Sengupta is more, let's say, scientific-minded, technical and patient-oriented. If you are serious about your oral health and not a casual dental patient then Dr Sengupta is the go-to person for you. ",

Finally, the initial pain that had driven me to see him in the first place was gone after a series of work done. Overall I did not feel pain at all after he used local anaesthesia. Very happy overall and highly recommend it.",

Outstanding care and as minimal pain as you can have with a root canal.he made me feel comfortable and if it wasn\u2019t for fingers and instruments in my mouth I would have fallen asleep.",
