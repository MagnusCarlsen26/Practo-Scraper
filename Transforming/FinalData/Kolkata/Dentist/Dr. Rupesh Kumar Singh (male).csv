When I met him, it  was probably 2-3 months before my marriage. Looking at my teeth he said, he is confident that he can fix it. I never felt so relieved. I did everything he said, and suddenly after around 2 months, he actually fixed it. I can never be more thankful to a doctor. He gave me my smile back! Words can't describe my emotions.
