I was supposed to go out of India for a month so she along with her expert doctors treated me within 5 days. all my 4 settings were completed in  5 days . Overall I would recommend her for sure .

Eventually, a sizable cavity emerged, signaling the urgent need for professional care.\n\nDespite initial hesitation, I sought out Dr. Anupreet Kaur Choudhury in Kolkata, driven by her stellar reviews. On a Sunday, with heightened pain due to the cold weather, I discovered her clinic, impeccably clean and adhering to COVID protocols. Dr. Kaur's warm demeanor immediately eased my fears.\n\nAfter explaining my dental woes, she conducted a thorough examination, revealing cavities and a misaligned wisdom tooth causing the pain. Despite my apprehensions from a past root canal, Dr. Kaur patiently addressed each query, explaining the necessary procedures and reassuring me. Encouraged by her confidence, I decided to proceed with a root canal.\n\nTo my surprise, the treatments were swift, spanning three sessions of 15-25 minutes each. Dr. Kaur, alongside Dr. Sumit and Dr. Gopal, exhibited expertise and care throughout, erasing my fears. The post-treatment phase was equally comforting, with no pain or discomfort, allowing me to resume normal eating habits.\n\nIn reflecting on this experience, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kaur and her team to anyone seeking a reliable dentist. A heartfelt thank you to Dr. Anupreet Kaur Choudhury and her dedicated team for restoring my confidence in dental care.",

I also underwent RCT for a molar tooth and it was painless(other than the minimal pain which is expected during the treatment).\nBoth the extraction and Root Canal Treatment were done very professionally. Dr. Kaur eased me well into them, by explaining everything involved during and after the procedures. Staff at Dentall have also been very cooperative and helpful throughout the course of days the procedures happened, responding to any query after the procedures. I also underwent removal of dental brackets and scaling, which were both done very proficiently by Dr. Anupreet without any pain or discomfort. \nI must add she is an amazing person with immense experience in her field and her dealing with patients is extremely professional, rare in today's world and highly commendable.",

The most important thing is she made me understand every detail of my problem and the treatment that she is going to do. This made me more confident about the treatment. I was always very sceptical about tooth extraction as I have heard from people that it's very painful process, that is the reason I had delayed my treatment thinking that the pain in my teeth will go automatically with time. But to my surprise the way she extracted my tooth was so quick and completely painless. Even after returning home I never felt even a slightest pain in my teeth as if no extraction is done at all !! The bleeding was also very less during extraction. Overall I am very very satisfied with her treatment. This experience completely took  away all the fear that I had about visiting a dentist. THANK YOU SO MUCH MA'AM \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f....Last but not the least the clinic is also very good, they follow all Covid guidelines ( sanitization processes etc.) , it's clean and hygienic.

During consultation, she understood my problems and advised  me for RCT of my teeth and as i gave my  consent, she started the 1st sitting immediately. ** ******** ** * ****** ******* ******** she did the whole 4 sittings of RCT within a week without having any pain in my teeth. She is so smooth in doing the procedures and  while giving the injection, you will hardly feel any discomfort. She also helped me with post procedure care to be taken for my teeth. she advised me with a very good toothpaste and interdental brushes. I felt very happy for my decision to visit her. I want to thank her very much and surely practo which helped me always to find a good doctor whenever i was in need. Thanks.",

But you never gave that chance.Moreover it was a surgical extraction that may last upto an hour.The tooth was given a try for root canal treatment by 2 other dentists earlier that made it brittle and a hopeless case,some kind of discomfort is always expected with medical and dental treatment. You forgot to mention that the whole budget was about 22000INR out of which only 3000 INR had been deposited and your 80percent of the dental work is complete. Also, it is the team work that matters, so if the RCT was done by some other MDS doctor along with me, you should be bothered about the end-result .Also, it was done under my supervision.Since you had no time to stay back in Kolkata for more than 2 months,so an option of implant was ruled out,instead bridging option was suggested.",

My brother gave me the suggestion to visit this clinic as he also had gone through RCT treatment before. On reaching the clinic.Dr.Anupreet looked into the issue and advised to take the RCT treatment. It was really a good experience as Dr.Anupreet is very professional. She along with Dr. Sumit and Dr. Gopal helped in diagnosis, RCT treatment and crowning. There was total 4 sittings and all days went well and I feel a lot less pain now. It was my first time vising to the dentist but I can definitely say, it was worthwhile. I would recommend anyone having tooth problems should visit Dentall for sure. They are definitely going to get relief from their tooth problems.",

Moreover ,step-by-step procedure was explained to the patient that would help him to get rid of  the existing problem.",

So i decided to visit her as i wanted the get the very best of the bests. When i visited the clinic i was impressed to see all the Covid protocols were taken care of. She quickly examined my problems and suggested me to get a RCT, the arrangement for the first sitting was done on the very day because I told her that I'll be returning back to my hometown due to corona, which shows the priority that she have for her patients. The procedure went smoothly as one of her fellow experienced doctor also came to help. Totally recommend to anyone. If you're looking to get the very best quality treatment, you obviously need to spent some bucks.",

Next morning I took a appointment to a dental care near my home and was called that very day. I got to know it was root canal and had to do the treatment immediately or else it would get worst. So my treatment started the very next day. I have a fear of injection and I was already told about the entire procedure of root canal so I knew I had to put one injection. Honestly I was so scared about this injection thing that I almost decided to cancel the appointment and I was already very late. But somehow I managed to go but was still damn scared of the injection. Then my treatment started and it didn't pain me at all not even a bit. Am so glad I did this treatment and the good thing is I didn't feel any pain. Am definitely recommending everyone who is scared or going through the tooth problems to visit here. Overall it was a very good experience and also got to know how important is our teeth which is always ignored and we actually need to take care of our teeth like we take care of every other serious diseases. Thank you to the dental care.",

I was in hurry since the beggining, because I had my wedding within a week, and the doctor took that responsibility on her and she suggested me the best service to go with. The 90% of the processes was completed on the same day if visit and then within 2 days, I was able to close the gap. The doctor exactly matched the tooth color with my natural teeth and changed my smile entirely. Overall I am happy and highly satisfied. Thank you so much for such an awesome aesthetic dental procedure. ",

But my mother was not so comfortable with the dentist and the treatment. My mother was literally afraid of dentist during the treatment period so we have to discontinue the ongoing treatment. But toothache was there so we visited Dr. Kaur Chaudhury . and thankfully the way Dr. Kaur treated her so, mother co operated all the sittings required for treatment. even further dentist informed me that all the sittings were done without anaesthesia. I am very happy with the entire procedure and experience with Dr. Kaur. Thanks Mam... ",

Moreover charges of RCT of wisdom teeth are higher, secondly nobody should be blamed for this lockdown,so condition of your teeth deteriorated when neither the clinic was open,nor could anyone move out in lockdown in India.",
