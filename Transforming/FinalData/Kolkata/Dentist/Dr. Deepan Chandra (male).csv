"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Dental Cavities,",0,0,NO,"We have visited Dr. Deepan Chandra on 17th July this year for filling three teeth. He made the filling and overcharged us for that 7.5k. We were shocked **** *** **** ****** ***** we had to pay so much.   In this period of pandemic to be overcharged  like that is really tough. Nonetheless we payed, thought may be the quality must be good. But in two days the filling of two teeth came out. On 09th October we called the doctor and he gave us an appointment on the same day. When we came we talked him the reason of our visit and I requested him just redo only those teeth where the filling fall out. He said that there is one more tooth nearby with cavity so I agreed to make cavity treatment of that too. When the work was done he on his own applied sum gel on the teeth which cost 3k. Overall he charged us 8k. Even for the teeth that he fill so badly he charged us again. I tried to explain that at this period of life with pandemic for us to be overcharged is difficulty he did not pay any attention to our words and we had no any other way to pay his bill. So, who ever is going to visit the doctor my suggestion first ask him how much he is going to charge you, so you shall not be in a position where we have been.",2020-10-09 11:13:39,False,False,S Mollah,"You are wrong. You were charged exactly at par with the industry standards for the materials used for your treatment. 
During the pandemic you should know that the dentists have to bear huge overhead costs to run clinic as per WHO & CDC guidelines. So, it is obvious that the treatment charges have gone up much higher in this  period. 
You were charged only for the new cavities that were restored. 
Moreover the fluoride gel application was done only after informing you after you demanded anticavity preventive therapy. ",2020-10-09T14:17:16+0000,Dr. Deepan Chandra
