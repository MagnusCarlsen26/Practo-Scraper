"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Lying on the dentist's table is a frightening experience. The challenge of the dentist therefore is to earn the trust and confidence of the patient as quickly as possible. After the two sittings  I have so far had with Shruti, I am pleased to say that I feel comfortable with her. Her procedures on my teeth (root canal and preparation for subsequent capping) were carried out flawlessly. She also had maintained good communication with me right through the procedures and helped me relax. The only downside I have to mention is that I found her support staff below par. When asked to hand over an instrument or an accessory, they often took a very long time, which in my experience is very unusual.  This is probably a training and management issue, but it needs the attention of the owners of the clinic.  ",2020-01-09 17:15:03,False,True,INDRAJIT BHOWMICK,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Shruti explained what was wrong with my tooth and what she would be doing for my root canal. She was very patient with me when I was getting pain and would stop till I was comfortable. That was very kind of her. Thank you Dr. 

I would like to add that the reception staff were most helpful and efficient. 

However the charges for root canal are very steep. 

Dr. Shruti asked me not to talk whilst the procedure was on and all instructions would be written on the prescription which was not so. I had to message her to find out what I should do. .
