Time given here is till 5 pm. I called him yesterday for extraction of my number 7 molar, and he asked me to come in second half. But due to my surprise, at 3:10 he asked the reception to cancel all appointment as he has an emergency OT. I called him, he told OT might take time and I may have to wait till 7. I agreed for it, as I cannot afford leave or loss of pay everyday.\nAfter few minutes he informed receptionist again and asked to cancel my appointment. I specifically asked , he is going to do the OT in apollo itself , answer was affirmative. Then I got a message from him saying he is attending a friends clinic for emergency which is not permissible as he works full time with apollo, because I also gave him the option to visit that place and get my extraction done, then he fired on me over phone and shouted at me in Bengali which I am quoting here \u201cAmi ki apnar daas khot sign korechi, je amni ja bollben tai hobe, Ami amake bar bar amar personal number e phone kore birokto korchen (that was the number he publishes in his prescription, so don\u2019t know how come that become his personal number). Ami apnake dekhbo na, you can complain to apollo management \u201c .\nI still tried to make up by apologizing hime, without any fault of mine. I was in emergency and visited him on 3rd of April, where he himself suggested to extract as there is a lesion below the RCT teeth. But didn\u2019t get any response.\n**** **** ** ****** ****** ** ****** **** ********** *** *** ******* ************ ****** ** ********* * *** ********** *** ******* *** ****** ** ******* ***** *** **** ******** ***** ******** *** ****** ******* *** **** ** **** ** ***** **** ********* ******** *** ** *** ** *** ******* ******* ***** ***** * **** **** ****** ******* ** ******* ******** ** *** ******* *********** ***** ** ***** ** ** **** ****** So my suggestions is to stay away from this doctor.
