She heard my problem patiently, checked my teeth and discssued the pros n cons of the treatment. Also, she gave me an estimate of the cost and the time required for the treatment beforehand. When I agreed to go ahead with the treatment, she gave me an appointment considering both of our convenience. I found the Dr. very cooperative and friendly. During the treatment, utmost care was taken for covid. She was very patient and meticulous throughout the process. At each step she made sure if I am comfortable. It took almost 1.30-2 hrs for teeth reconstruction with scaling and polishing. She didn't hurry at all. The finishing was so good that its impossible to differentiate between the artificial and the real part. She asked me if any modifications needed, and when I requested minor changes she did it promptly. Overall I am highly impressed by the quality of treatment and more importantly by the hassle free feel good process. You can trust Dr Gupta blindly for any dental issues. Highly recommended.\n",

Was on antibiotic course already but infection still persisted.\nI was not able to manage without periodic painkillers. She did immediate assessment of my tooth and suggested extraction of the same as Re-RCT would not work considering the condition of the tooth.\nNext day Dr. Rohini Gupta and Dr. Anuj both extracted my tooth. The extraction was pretty critical and involved minor surgery. With immense patience both of them made this happen.\nAfter the surgery I visited them thrice for follow up on post operative healing , and both of them always were available and helped me with necessary support. In spite of there being rush in the clinic both of them are way too good in managing time and availability for their patients. Reasonable with charges, expert in their work and amicable in their behaviour, both are helping me sway through this tough phase of mine and now I am healing. Starting from pain point identification to pain removal, they are prompt in providing their patient relief. \nA big thanks to both!!",

Then after google searching I have found Dr Rohini Gupta's name and good review in practo site.  Dr Rohini Gupta's academic profile in practo speaks her competency. But it is really tested & experienced while I have done my RCT in her Saltlake chamber. Cool chamber, very clean. Total three seatings for RCT , excellent knowledge about the subject, very professional approach, explained the query from the patient, impacable maintaing of time management. Almost painfree RCT. Her team consisting of another two persons, they are Moumita & Sandeep , they are so co-operative & always having smiling on their face. Overall our experience at Teeth & Gum clinic is fabulous and we are looking for further ensuing dental treatment at her clinic.I shall take this opportunity to thank Dr Rohini Gupta & her team for all the treatment & help , they rendered to us.",

After the anaesthetic shot, i felt absolutely nothing ..the whole treatment time was less than an hour and all throughout she kept guiding me from step to step.. I was always scared to visit dentists ..but Dr Rohini changed the whole equation for me..I am definitely visiting her for the few tooth fillings she recommended. Lastly the staff is very helpful, right from appointment to billing everything was so easily done.Thank you Teeth and Gums!!after ",

When you reported next , I found the tooth had fractured and we could extract it with great difficulty. It took great effort to get the fractured pieces out part by part and inspite of it we charged you a fraction of the normal surgical extraction charges because you agreed that there was a misunderstanding regarding the crown placement following RCT .\nSince the extraction was difficult, sutures were placed  and all required medications were prescribed..when you  called to ask for solution regarding bleeding after surgery, I explained that a difficult surgery might follow light bleeding and yet added some more medication as per your request. You need to understand that doctors don't prescribe medication unless the situation requires and that is why the patients are duly noted to  call if any such situation arises.\nHowever if you have any other grievance you are most welcome to address your concerns with us.\nRegards\nDr Rohini",

The one thing I like the most about the endodontist is that she tries her best and is never in a hurry.She takes radiographs everytime to check the status of the treatment procedure and will stop only when she feels that the tooth has been meted out with the required treatment. Patience is the key and Endodontist Rohini Gupta knows that well.I am really grateful to her and I really hope that my treated teeth last a life-time. ",

She heard my problem patiently, checked my teeth and discssued the pros n cons of the treatment. Also, she gave me an estimate of the cost and the time required for the treatment beforehand. When I agreed to go ahead with the treatment, she gave me an appointment considering both of our convenience. I found the Dr. very cooperative and friendly. During the treatment, utmost care was taken for covid. She was very patient and meticulous throughout the process. At each step she made sure if I am comfortable. It took almost 1.30-2 hrs for teeth reconstruction with scaling and polishing. She didn't hurry at all. The finishing was so good that its impossible to differentiate between the artificial and the real part. She asked me if any modifications needed, and when I requested minor changes she did it promptly. Overall I am highly impressed by the quality of treatment and more importantly by the hassle free feel good process. You can trust Dr Gupta blindly for any dental issues. Highly recommended.\n",

Was on antibiotic course already but infection still persisted.\nI was not able to manage without periodic painkillers. She did immediate assessment of my tooth and suggested extraction of the same as Re-RCT would not work considering the condition of the tooth.\nNext day Dr. Rohini Gupta and Dr. Anuj both extracted my tooth. The extraction was pretty critical and involved minor surgery. With immense patience both of them made this happen.\nAfter the surgery I visited them thrice for follow up on post operative healing , and both of them always were available and helped me with necessary support. In spite of there being rush in the clinic both of them are way too good in managing time and availability for their patients. Reasonable with charges, expert in their work and amicable in their behaviour, both are helping me sway through this tough phase of mine and now I am healing. Starting from pain point identification to pain removal, they are prompt in providing their patient relief. \nA big thanks to both!!",

Then after google searching I have found Dr Rohini Gupta's name and good review in practo site.  Dr Rohini Gupta's academic profile in practo speaks her competency. But it is really tested & experienced while I have done my RCT in her Saltlake chamber. Cool chamber, very clean. Total three seatings for RCT , excellent knowledge about the subject, very professional approach, explained the query from the patient, impacable maintaing of time management. Almost painfree RCT. Her team consisting of another two persons, they are Moumita & Sandeep , they are so co-operative & always having smiling on their face. Overall our experience at Teeth & Gum clinic is fabulous and we are looking for further ensuing dental treatment at her clinic.I shall take this opportunity to thank Dr Rohini Gupta & her team for all the treatment & help , they rendered to us.",

After the anaesthetic shot, i felt absolutely nothing ..the whole treatment time was less than an hour and all throughout she kept guiding me from step to step.. I was always scared to visit dentists ..but Dr Rohini changed the whole equation for me..I am definitely visiting her for the few tooth fillings she recommended. Lastly the staff is very helpful, right from appointment to billing everything was so easily done.Thank you Teeth and Gums!!after ",

When you reported next , I found the tooth had fractured and we could extract it with great difficulty. It took great effort to get the fractured pieces out part by part and inspite of it we charged you a fraction of the normal surgical extraction charges because you agreed that there was a misunderstanding regarding the crown placement following RCT .\nSince the extraction was difficult, sutures were placed  and all required medications were prescribed..when you  called to ask for solution regarding bleeding after surgery, I explained that a difficult surgery might follow light bleeding and yet added some more medication as per your request. You need to understand that doctors don't prescribe medication unless the situation requires and that is why the patients are duly noted to  call if any such situation arises.\nHowever if you have any other grievance you are most welcome to address your concerns with us.\nRegards\nDr Rohini",

The one thing I like the most about the endodontist is that she tries her best and is never in a hurry.She takes radiographs everytime to check the status of the treatment procedure and will stop only when she feels that the tooth has been meted out with the required treatment. Patience is the key and Endodontist Rohini Gupta knows that well.I am really grateful to her and I really hope that my treated teeth last a life-time. ",

Full credits to mam for excellence in RCT which is considered to be very painful and sorrowful treatment.\nI really didn't expect my original tooth pain would be relieved so fast after a single sitting. The Doctor is very attentive and caring. I would rate my experience with Dr. Rohini Gupta as top in class, Up to date procedures and excellent Patient service.\n\nThanks to the Doctor.",

Another doctor had advised root canal treatment for it..but Dr Rohini simply advised for a filling which was done in around half an hour. My tooth looks very natural and it's difficult to make out any difference.I am really pleased with the honest feedback she gave regarding all treatment methods and the amount of time she took to discuss everything . We really need more brilliant and caring  doctors around like her .Other than this, I must say her clinic is located at a very convenient location near salt lake swimming pool. The clinic is tidy, well maintained with good hygiene. Totally worth your time and money.",
