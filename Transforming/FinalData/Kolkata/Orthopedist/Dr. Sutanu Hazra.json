But after visiting the the doctor, I think I am not satisfied with his treatment. He came to the clinic at least 45 minutes late and he just gave 5-7minutes to check my mother. He asked my mother about her problems and wrote down all the problems on his pad and wrote to do 7 types of tests and gave two medicines to take. Nothing was explained by him. Just told us to visit him one week later with all the test reports. For this 7 minutes consultation he is charging 800/-",
