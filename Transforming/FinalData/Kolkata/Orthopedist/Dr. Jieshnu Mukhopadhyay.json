I visited the doctor He examined me thoroughly and guided me with medications even during the rush hours of Durga Puja when most of the doctors in town were unavailable. I was nervous after my MRI report so out of agony i called him on the morning of Saptami. But he met me in his chamber in the evening and drove away my fear. with 1 month medicine exercise and physiotherapy my problems are gone. ",
