Dr. is very understanding, listens patiently to the health concerns, reviews all the reports.  He is very accommodative  (as I was traveling) and gave a Monday morning appointment at the hospital for angiogram.   He also immediately coordinated with the hospital staff and made sure the checkin process at the hospital would go smooth.\n\nDr AR explained the procedure,  the diagnosis and treatment very clearly every step of the way.   He performed angioplasty based on the findings right away, and my father recovered quickly in a couple of days.\n\nWhen we visited the clinic post op, the staff at the clinic was courteous and wait time was very short.    Dr AR is highly professional and has shown true commitment to solve my father's health issues.  We highly recommend Dr AR  for any cardiac related diagnosis and treatment. ",

Dr. is very understanding, listens patiently to the health concerns, reviews all the reports.  He is very accommodative  (as I was traveling) and gave a Monday morning appointment at the hospital for angiogram.   He also immediately coordinated with the hospital staff and made sure the checkin process at the hospital would go smooth.\n\nDr AR explained the procedure,  the diagnosis and treatment very clearly every step of the way.   He performed angioplasty based on the findings right away, and my father recovered quickly in a couple of days.\n\nWhen we visited the clinic post op, the staff at the clinic was courteous and wait time was very short.    Dr AR is highly professional and has shown true commitment to solve my father's health issues.  We highly recommend Dr AR  for any cardiac related diagnosis and treatment. ",
