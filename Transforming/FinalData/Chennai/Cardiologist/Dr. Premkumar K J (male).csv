,,0,0,Yes,My mom had visited the hospital and it was chest pain related. Consultation was fine by the doctor. I can surelyÂ recommend doctor to my family or friends circle. There was no waiting time in the hospital. Tablets were prescribed by the doctor. Medical tests were done in the hospital. Diet was suggested. She had surgery before. She has chest pain still and we have appointment this week in July. Hospitality was good. Doctor was friendly. ,2021-07-24 05:49:45,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
