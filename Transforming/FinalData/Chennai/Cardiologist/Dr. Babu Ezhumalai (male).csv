,,0,0,YES,"I had  a massive heart attack on 16.05.2021 being Sunday, total lock down at Chennai by 11.30 a.m.
It was massive in the sense it was called widow maker heart attack.I was rushed and virtually lifted by my brother in his car within 20 minutes to Kavery Hospital and it was found out that there there was 100% block in the main  valve of the heart. Angio was done ,the block was removed  but stent was fixed by a leading international cardiologist.
Follow up check up was done on 4 occasion s by him.
But unfortunately he never asked me to take ECG or Echocardiogram. Due to this on 23rd November 2021 I was breathless and could not lie down or sit.
My bladder was full. No urine output. This continued on 24 th November 2021. On 25 th November 2021 I was taken to Kavery for OP check up but all the cardiologists were busy in Angio and they refused to talk to me  at least over intercom.
We returned empty handed. No appointment in his private clinic.
On 26 th November God gave the contact of Dr E.BABU International Cardiologist through my younger brother.
We ,( myself and my wife) took an appointment by contacting Malar hospital and met him. By seeing condition of being wheel chair bound immediately instructed us to take ECG and Echocardiogram and added some medicines.
What a miracle on the same night I had a good and sound sleep.
All my problems were completely resolved by his prescription of additional medicines.

My father-in-law was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease - Triple vessel disease after he had a sever chest pain and left shoulder pain on one Sunday night.  Doctor had immediately performed primary angioplasty with stenting in one of the vessels and performed staged revascularization on the other two vessels.  His quality of life is improved now.
