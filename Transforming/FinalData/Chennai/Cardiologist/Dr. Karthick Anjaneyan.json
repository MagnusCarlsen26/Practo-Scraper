I was advised to take medicine prescribed and to apply ointment for the wounds. After 3months I was advised to take appointment with Dr.Karthik for review. I am doing as advised. I use to take BP reading every day morning. I found my BP High inspite of taking tablet both morning and evening. I have no way to contact or inform Dr. Today I asked for appointment and am given Thursday 12.30pm to meet Dr.Karthik.\nI feel stressed. Expect my Cardiologist to provide atleast a direct communication so as to enable his patients like me to get relieved and to have a moral support. I pray the Almighty to have my High BP tension gets solved. Thank you for this facility to express my feelings ",
