,,0,0,NO,"While he may be a good doctor, his way of handling patients leaves a lot to be desired. Dr.Kaushik speaks in a very condescending tone and doesn't answer any questions or concerns that the patients might have. Also the medicines he prescribes are only available in his clinic where he operates, making it very difficult for us to procure them while traveling.",2022-09-23 12:48:04,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
