,,0,0,YES,Extremely professional and down to earth doctor. She is very well read and patiently answered all my questions. I approached Dr. Sai for my 2 years old girl baby. She heard all my concerns with attention and gave an assessment plan. The assessments were done by her team of therapists who showed commendable diction and precision in their approach. A clear plan was provided and doctor counselled us about the strengths and difficulty faced by my child very well* **** ****** *** *********** ***** **** ***** ** ** *** ************* ***** ** ******,2021-06-05 19:07:37,False,True,Vasavi,,,

,,0,0,YES,My experience was amazing with Dr. Sai Sucheetra. I felt that Dr. Sucheetra is very much interested in my 4 years sonâ€™s physical and mental health and his comfort. Everything is well explained about his shortcomings. I never made to feel that caring for us is a burden for doctor. I am no reluctance to ask for what I need . On top of that the medical outcome is great in last 8 month since we start to work and taking care of our child with her guidance. I would recommend Dr. Sucheetra to anyone home and abroad who needs this procedure.,2020-07-29 08:52:29,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
