So i wanted to take her for an overall treatment.\n\nI came to know about Dr. Thomas George when I researched about specialists in preventive healthcare/internal medicines. I took my mother for a consultation with him. He did a comprehensive study and started his treatment four months ago. Over these days there is significant improvement in her pigmentation, sleep deprivation and numbness issues. She now has hope that all these ailments can be cured. \n\nAbove all Dr. Thomas George is so caring and friendly. He gets to know the very minute details. He listens to the patients and answers all the queries in a more courteous way. He avoids unnecessary scans/tests/medicines and knows exactly what he is doing. I am happy that I took my mother to the right medical practitioner",

So i wanted to take her for an overall treatment.\n\nI came to know about Dr. Thomas George when I researched about specialists in preventive healthcare/internal medicines. I took my mother for a consultation with him. He did a comprehensive study and started his treatment four months ago. Over these days there is significant improvement in her pigmentation, sleep deprivation and numbness issues. She now has hope that all these ailments can be cured. \n\nAbove all Dr. Thomas George is so caring and friendly. He gets to know the very minute details. He listens to the patients and answers all the queries in a more courteous way. He avoids unnecessary scans/tests/medicines and knows exactly what he is doing. I am happy that I took my mother to the right medical practitioner",

He recommends scans or tests only if necessary. Unlike the trend we see oflate.  Felt happy and relieved that we found a doc whom we can trust blindly. Any ailment just go to him. He will suggest or guide the right one. ",

I had approached different specialists at top hospitals only to have them invalidate my experience. Every doctor i went to told me that my bloodwork was fine and i was just imagining it and made me give up on seeking treatment. After seeing amazing reviews for Dr Thomas George, i decided to have a consultation. He made me take only necessary tests and gave prompt accurate diagnosis. After 2 long years of struggle i was able to breath with ease, all thanks to Dr Thomas George. He is very approachable. There have been situations where I'd text him in whatsapp and he makes the time to respond back to my querries. Such a friendly doctor. Down to earth person. I'd 100% recommend him to everyone i know because im absolutely certain that  people are in the safest of hands if they choose Dr. Thomas George. ",

He went through the report and quickly commented that something was wrong with the report. \nAs he wanted to conduct a detailed investigation, I was admitted in the hospital and I had undergone all the major tests recommended by him. At the end after him studying all the reports he had conclusively confirmed to me that my kidneys are in good health. He found that some of the medicines that I had been taking had caused the variations and gave me a new set of medicines. I\u2019m really happy with the way Dr. George had conducted the diagnosis. Dr. A. Thomas George was very understanding, explicit in his diagnosis and took great effort to make me understand and explained to me in detail. I am really thankful to him for taking care of me.",

The charges were breathtaking. On asking him if I can get these tests done from somewhere else since the price being charged here is unaffordable to me, he started cutting down a few tests to make it reasonable for me. Absolute weirdo! When I again requested him that if I can get it done from somewhere else and share reports with him and he may diagnose the same, he clearly said a NO. Asked me to see a new doctor because the doctor precisely doesn't see reports for tests done outside their hospital. Oh, BTW, he even gave me rates ** ****** *** other hospitals in Chennai and tried making me believe that what they are charging is too less yet genuine - totally ridiculous!",

The above complaints and findings is alarming and a cause of concern since you are only 34 years old and the complaints have been persistenting for 6 montha inspite of seeing other doctors. The above complaints and findings cannot be translated into a diagnosis without a complete work up. You were counselled and adequately explained about the need for a complete work up and its cost which you have deliberately exaggerated. In anycase wish you all the very best , may god bless you .",

Hence they will not be able to come on time not forgetting the fact that their children have to taken care at home during this period   2)All your medical complaints were heard and documented in the letter head  3) You were also examined adequately , which most doctors fail to do during this COVID period 4) The examination findings have been written and documented in the letter head 5) Your medical condition was explained to you more than adequately for almost more than 15 mins- 6) We doctors have certain protocols to be followed during this COVID pandemic period to safeguard your health my health and our healthcare workers health.  It\u2019s time for patients to understand the plight of the Doctors and healthcare worker. Even when all are scared and taking shelter in their home, we are in the frontline to serve the community. I don\u2019t think I need to explain more. One has to be more understanding in such situations. Dr Thomas George",

Hence it is my duty and responsibility with my 40 yrs of my medical experience to give you the correct diagnosis \n5) when you are not able to find a diagnosis for 7 months, you can\u2019t expect me to give you a complete diagnosis in 20 mins time without appropriate investigations \n6) It is  a BLATANT LIE to state that you told me that you would get your tests done in a place close to your house.\n7) yes, I love to save lives of critically ill patients and hence I am busy. I greatly appreciate that you did not accuse that I am lazy.!\nAnyways, as a Senior citizen and and a doctor, that\u2019s all I can do... \nthis is the only explanation I can give.
