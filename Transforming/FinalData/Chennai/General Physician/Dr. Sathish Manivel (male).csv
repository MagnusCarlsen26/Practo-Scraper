,,0,0,YES,"I had Umbilical Hernia, for past thirteen years, due to this, last year, I had certain discomfort. I visited a renowned hospital but was not satisfied with the response from them. I was later referred to Dr. Sathish Manivel, I met him, he took time to listen to my ailments and suggested a plan for my surgery. On 3rd May, I underwent Abdominoplasty with Liposuction/Umbilical Hernia Repair with Right Para Ovarian Cystectomy. Now I have fully recovered, by following doctors guidance and I have joined my duty. I am grateful to Dr. Sathish Manivel.",2023-07-24 14:17:02,False,True,Deepa Persis,,,
