When we reached the clinic, around 9:00 p.m,the doctor had already left ,but the receptionist called her and she rushed to the Clinic within 10 mts,had a thorough examination ,comforted her and prescribed the essential medication.\nIt is indeed a blessing to have such a Dedicated & Caring Physician at the proximity of our house.. we are so grateful to her on attending on my daughter especially during this pandemic times and too at night leaving her children behind at home. And also avoiding an immediate CT scan, thereby saving us from shelling out too. My daughter is getting better,such a relief,may God bless the doctor and her  dedication to her profession.",
