,,0,0,NO,They charged us ₹800 and accepted cash only. Where as it was mentioned everywhere in the hospital that they accept digital payment methods. They made me wait around and beg around to accept a google pay of the difference amount as I only had ₹600 in cash including every penny in my pocket. I had enough money to swipe or transfer but the people are so rude. I got an appoinment of 3pm where in Dr comes only after 4.30pm. When asked they keep saying that it was already reported to practo months ago and nobody changed anything on the page. * ***** **** ******* ** **** * ********* ******* **** ** **** either ways its really difficult to handle all this when you are sick.,2021-04-27 18:27:53,False,False,Sruthi Nair,,,
