Sugar level was 300 above when we met the doctor and with the great guidance of this doctor, not only his sugar level is normal but he is energetic, his wound is healing fast. We are so thankful to God that we met this doctor. Meeting him was a miracle for us.  After the visit, my husband is so positive about his health.  So far my experience with Diha hospital, Nanganalloor is the best. ",
