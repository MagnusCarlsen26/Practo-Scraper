He respects the patient/attendant regardless of their religion language and who they are. He treats the upset mental condition of the patient along with treating the disease, supporting patient with best available information and unbiased treatment options respecting the patient's choice over it. I found him examining the patient reports /records thoroughly with eagle eye. He has kept an option of email for patients which we can use as a means of communication in urgency. He even called me for urgent consultation by replying my mail.Its indeed great that he finds out time to reply our mails out of his busy schedule. Noteworthy that his prescription is so detailed and clear that no explanation is required from others to follow the instructions. He is very honest and candid in his statements regarding the anything or I can say for example, chemo therapy side-effects and the best medicinal support to withstand  it. After one month ongoing treatment and several consultations,me and my father,67 (patient)is highly satisfied to have a doctor like him. My father always say that Dr Zehran in future will be a great doctor wherever he be. We wish Apollo Hospital our vote of thanks for  offering us such great doctor and hope to maintain its quality in all sphere of medical care in future. \n                                       With best regards\n                                    Mukunda Medhi, Guwahati\n                                     Assam",
