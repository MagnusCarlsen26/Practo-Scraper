He asked what's purpose of visit and we told him we came for routine check-up and he was like you are coming after 3 years. He told to continue same medicines. Multivitamin tablets were prescribed but he didn't suggest or write when to use and how many to be taken. We purchased and later we checked with nurse about tablets. There was some waiting time in the hospital, it was for 30 minutes.",
