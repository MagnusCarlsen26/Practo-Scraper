Whatever medications he prescribed to me was adequate and helpful for me. The best thing is that he didn't suggest any unwanted tests. But the only problem I noticed was that they consider only one week as a follow-up and after that, we have to pay the consultation fees as normal. If they can consider some concession in that, it will be really helpful.",
