"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Acupuncture,",0,0,YES,"I am married for 7 years and we planned to have a child after 3 years of our married life. While we were very eager to start a family, I could not get pregnant as easily as I thought. Myself and my husband were living abroad and were quite hesitant to start with any fertility treatment hastily without any proper guidance. 
Hence, I came down to India in 2018 for a health checkup at a renowned hospital in Chetpet, Chennai. After a master checkup, the chief doctor there performed Hysterolaproscopy for a left  tubal disconnection. Also, later I was told that I could get pregnant only through IVF. With no other option left and without asking any 2nd opinion, I underwent all the procedures for IVF. Finally at the end of the IVF procedure, after embryo transplant , it was sad to know that I did not conceive. It was so harrowing to experience that feel, because emotionally and financially it was quite a loss for us. Though the IVF doctor asked me to go for a second attempt immediately even after the failed attempt, I was not physically and mentally prepared for it again.

Thats when I met Dr.Rajesh Verma at Bliss Acupuncture, Vadapalani in November 2019. After talking in detail about my experience and going through my health reports, Dr. Rajesh Verma guided to me undergo an Acupuncture session for a period of 6 months and assured me that I will definitely get pregnant before the completion of this 6 months. It was a 15 day session every month and I also took combination medicines that he suggested along with Acupuncture to improve my overall immunity and better health and fertility. Doctor assured me that I could naturally conceive and if by chance needed also I could try for IUI option and definitely not in need for IVF as I had age and my fertility level was satisfactory. 

With all the confidence that Dr. Rajesh gave me and the best Acupuncture treatment that I got from him and the blessings of the almighty I got pregnant in March 2020. Owing to my time constraint I opted for IUI for my pregnancy. I got pregnant in IUI in my first attempt. 

I am now a happy mom to a BABY BOY. I cannot thank Dr. Rajesh Verma enough for the happiness that I am enjoying today being a mother. I should say, he diagnosed where my problem was and treated me exactly. His accuracy in the treatment is excellent. I highly recommend other people who are trying for pregnancy or not able to get pregnant to have an opinion with Dr.Rajesh Verma before choosing any hasty options as he genuinely guides you in the right path.
