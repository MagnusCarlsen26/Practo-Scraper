She has a very warm and positive personality and answers our numerous questions with patience. Her approach to treating ailments seem very practical - using the efficiency of modern medicine and at the same time not forcing us to deviate from cultural practices (unless they are harmful for the baby). Despite being a visiting doctor in numerous hospitals hinting a very busy schedule she responds to us on a timely manner. We have a deep respect for her knowledge in the field as well as her attitude in general, and hence will always recommend her to be your child's paediatrician. ",

This time I had my list of questions ready to shoot before she sends us out. \r\nThis time around, she forgot to tell us that the baby could fall sick post vaccination and suggest the appropriate medicine. When asked as well, this did not strike her. Well, she was too busy with her smartphone to have heard it. The baby did fall sick and cried all night. We rushed to the hospital at 3am (READ 3 IN THE MORNING) where he was delivered and the duty nurse suggested we give Paracetamol for the time-being and admit the baby so the doctor could visit the following day! The Paracetamol worked well. We decided not to admit and see her ever again!",

Despite being a visiting doctor in numerous hospitals hinting a very busy schedule she responds to us on a timely manner. We have a deep respect for her knowledge in the field as well as her attitude in general, and hence will always recommend her to be your child's paediatrician. ",

This time I had my list of questions ready to shoot before she sends us out. \r\nThis time around, she forgot to tell us that the baby could fall sick post vaccination and suggest the appropriate medicine. When asked as well, this did not strike her. Well, she was too busy with her smartphone to have heard it. The baby did fall sick and cried all night. We rushed to the hospital at 3am (READ 3 IN THE MORNING) where he was delivered and the duty nurse suggested we give Paracetamol for the time-being and admit the baby so the doctor could visit the following day! The Paracetamol worked well. We decided not to admit and see her ever again!",
