After a thorough examination, he prescribed minimal medication for seven days followed by a tailored set of exercises. Over the course of six months of dedication to the exercise regimen, my wife experienced a remarkable recovery.\n\nInitially, my wife was unable to move her right hand from the shoulder to the elbow due to the stiffness and pain associated with frozen shoulder. However, thanks to Dr. Jeff Walter's treatment plan and her commitment to the exercises, she has made significant progress. She can now lift both her hands fully, indicating a complete recovery from the condition.\n\nI am truly impressed by the expertise and care provided by Dr. Jeff Walter. His accurate diagnosis, minimal medication approach, effective treatment plan, and personalized exercise routine have brought about life-changing improvements for my wife. I highly recommend Dr. Jeff Walter to anyone seeking treatment for shoulder-related issues.",

After a thorough examination, he prescribed minimal medication for seven days followed by a tailored set of exercises. Over the course of six months of dedication to the exercise regimen, my wife experienced a remarkable recovery.\n\nInitially, my wife was unable to move her right hand from the shoulder to the elbow due to the stiffness and pain associated with frozen shoulder. However, thanks to Dr. Jeff Walter's treatment plan and her commitment to the exercises, she has made significant progress. She can now lift both her hands fully, indicating a complete recovery from the condition.\n\nI am truly impressed by the expertise and care provided by Dr. Jeff Walter. His accurate diagnosis, minimal medication approach, effective treatment plan, and personalized exercise routine have brought about life-changing improvements for my wife. I highly recommend Dr. Jeff Walter to anyone seeking treatment for shoulder-related issues.",

We saw Dr. Jeff, and he suggested a hydrodilatation procedure. After that, my uncle's shoulder is back to normal, and he's using his arm without any pain or issues.\n\nWhat stands out about Dr. Jeff is his genuine empathy for his patients. He takes the time to explain the problem, the possible solutions, and the best option based on the patient's age and condition. Throughout the whole process, he treated us like family. If you need an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Jeff is the one to trust. I highly recommend him to anyone reading this.",

Just by observing the patients walk, postures , stretches he is able to identify the issues . He doesn't prescribe fancy tests or procedures. His empathy and reassurance to patient is also remarkable . As a patient I left the clinic with a clear diagnosis, a reassurance on the disease front as a forward looking person after Dr. Jeff sir interactions .In short  I intend to recommend my  patients like me to get free of the ortho problems I blindly suggest Dr.jeff sir thank you sir",

He  explains the problem / health issue in a simple, easy to understand manner. His accurate problem diagnosis ability, prescription of recent medicines, suggesting essential simple exercises and positive advice helped my recovery easy and faster. Waiting time in his clinic is between 05 to 30 minutes depending on the number of patients and their issues. From my experience, I have recommend Dr. Jeff Walter to my friends and they also felt happy with his ability to accurately identify problems and treatment. In future also I will recommend this doctor to my family, friends and known circle.",
