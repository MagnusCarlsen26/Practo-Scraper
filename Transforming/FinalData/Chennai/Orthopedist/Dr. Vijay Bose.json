This **** ******** hip replacement but it had failed once that was performed by a ortho surgeon in Bihar (Muzaffarpur). During surgery surgeon broke her femur bone and could not complete surgery. After surgery she was on bed and wheel chair for a year. Meanwhile i was looking for option if there is possibility of having a reconstruction and hip replacement surgery. She is 83 years old and otherwise healthy have no other  major health issue then I found name of Dr Vijay Bose (google search) and immediately contacted him. He responded promptly and asked me to arrange a visit which i did in August 2019 and further x-ray and evaluation he agreed to perform second surgery. I was afraid if she will survive second surgery however considering doctor's optimism i took a chance and went back in October. This has been over 6 weeks after surgery she started walking with walker with 2 days of surgery. Her recovery path has been exact the same as Doctor Bose told us. The SIMS hospital in Chennai is phenomenal, the staff are great. In spite of my mother language issue (knows only Hindi) the nursing staff manged very well. I only had great experience with Dr. Bose his staff, hospital.  I don't think i could have found in something like this in India. My mother giving blessing to every staff who cared for her.\n",
