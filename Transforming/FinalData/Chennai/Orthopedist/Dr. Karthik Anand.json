He took the time to make sure all my needs were met, by explaining the type of procedure and the advantages of the system. I felt reassured going into the surgery knowing that he was very confident about the process. On the day of surgery, he came in and talked with me and had prayer with my pastor, staff and my wife. He took the time to check on me three times after surgery before I left to go home. One week after surgery, I messaged him with a concern, and he took the time out of his busy schedule to get back to me. This man is very good at what he does and cares about his patients. I have never had a doctor that would follow through as much as Dr.Karthik Anand did. I am pleased and honored to have met and had him take care of me. I will and already have to recommend the man to anyone.",
