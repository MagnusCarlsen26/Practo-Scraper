Was specifically looking for someone who could educate me so I could tackle my disc herniation/disc bulge situation better. He was methodical, easy to talk to and took the time to thoroughly explain how to read an MRI and my X-rays while providing a thorough analysis of it. What I liked best was the fact that he provided me with a protocol for pain management in case of emergencies and also tips on what will be critical in the future on keeping pain at bay as I age. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with my visit and I'd definitely recommend him !",
