These two words I say with sincerity and gratitude. \n\nYou have sent a medic home to remove my 93 year old fathers stitches. It has saved my father from the anxiety of hitching on to an Ambukance for the ride up and back from the hospital. My father is ever so radiant and he thanks you from the bottom of his heart for the special care you and your hospital has given him. \n\nThank you very much and stay blessed \n\nReji george",
