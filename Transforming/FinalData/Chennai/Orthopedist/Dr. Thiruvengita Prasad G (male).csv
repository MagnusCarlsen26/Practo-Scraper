,,0,0,Yes,I had visited the hospital and it was neck pain related. Doctor was good in consulting me. Doctor was available and there was no waiting time in hospital. I can definitely recommend the doctor to my family and friends. We knew doctor well. Tablets were prescribed by the doctor. Ointment was suggested. Massage was suggested. Within one week it was resolved. As we work for more time and sit because of that I had neck pain as I work in IT. Doctor told to relax and take break while working once in a while and he was friendly.,2021-07-13 05:13:47,False,True,Ms Swetha,,,
