I have been suffering from Algodystrophy from one year and a half following an accident at work. All the treatments I underwent did not cure me. But your smile, your kindness, your humanity, your treatment and your advice have given me a lot of hope for recovery. I already feel better and I will continue the exercises you suggested. I really appreciated the quality of care provided by all the staff at your clinic. The cleanliness of the premises is wonderful. It would be good for all patients if all hospitals and clinics and if all doctors and care staff were like you and like your team in our Mother India. As planned, I will come back to meet you next month for another consultation. Thank you very much Sir. Mrs VEL Tilagavady",

It was a grade I tear back then.\nI had visited one of the leading orthopaedic surgeon in Chennai, they asked me to rest for a week and get back to my workout routine. Days flew but my pain kept on increasing. Then I decided to go to Apollo and got my knee examined by the chief doctor there and he suggested that I go in for some IFT physiotherapy.\nThat is when I searched online about good physiotherapy centres and OJAS was rated one among the best and I chose to get it done here.\nI had visited Ojas in the month of June.\nThe staff there are very kind and courteous, they suggested that I could once show my reports to Dr.P.R.Ashwin just to get a more clear understanding on what has to be done.\nThis was the time I lost all hopes that I would ever recover from the injury and get back to my normal workout routine.( leave alone workout, standing for more than 10 mins was a very big deal for me)\nThe very first time I met Dr.Ashwin , I was very much motivated.\nHe spreads a lot of positivity which according to me is what every person under pain requires. He educated me on what exactly I'm undergoing and he asked me to give it sometime since I was too young for a surgery. He asked me to believe in the natural healing process(unlike doctors who readily want to perform a surgery).\nHe later along with his team analysed my problem in detail and \nsuggested that I should go in for an Ultra sound guided Injection in my hamstring.Within 10 days I found myself to be in a better position that what I was, I was given some more physiotherapy which Dr.Ashwin was very kind enough to guide personally.\nNow I am back to my old fit self.\nAll thanks to Dr.Ashwin and his team.\nNow my entire family visits only him for any orthopaedic issues.\nIt is very important to fall in the right hands and feel confident about your doctor.\nUnlike most hospitals where they give appointments to all patients at once just to keep a crowded atmosphere, here at Ojas even the appointments are so sorted and you aren't made to wait very long (which is important , because it gets hard to sit an wait for hours when you are already sick)\nDr.Ashwin has a very modern approach to his treatment.\nHe makes sure you get the best available treatment.\nHe makes sure that there is a proper check on his patients via his staff.\nA special mention to his staff for dealing with patients with a lot of patience and a kind manner.\nYou can undoubtedly visit Ashwin doctor for your orthopaedic issues and I'm sure you would relate to everything I have said.\n",

The assurance on his face definitely increased my confidence and I realized, that with God\u2019s Grace, I am in the right hands. To be more precise, I have no other option, but, to attribute my special appreciation for his pain management treatment. Not once, did I feel any pain or discomfort, after my surgery. With lot of patience, he will always spend his valuable time with the patient, duly explaining him in detail and making him feel at home. Hats off to the doctor!! \nAt this juncture, I assume that may be my meeting with an accident, is a god given opportunity for me, to meet a person like Dr.Ashwin Vijay in my life!\n\nIt is always said that good people always get associated with good people.  That is why Dr.Ashwin Vijay has been blessed with a kind & capable person, like Mr. Jose, as his secretary.  I have never heard of any Doctor\u2019s secretary giving a call to the patient regularly and finding out how he is doing. \nFrom day one, till this date, Mr.Jose has been always rendering his service & support through frequent & timely phone calls. I am sure, definitely Mr.Jose is one of the valid reasons for Dr.Ashwin Vijay\u2019s success story.\n\nIn this context, it will be only fair on my part to wish Dr.Ashwin Vijay and his secretary Mr.Jose, all success in their journey.\n\nIn nutshell, without any second thought, I will definitely recommend Dr.Ashwin Vijay as a NUMBER 1 CHOICE for any orthopaedic consultation.",

Met Dr. Ashwin to consult my son\u2019s shoulder dislocation problem on our vacation during March and he suggested some good advice to keep him fit and continue his games.\nLast month (July) we went to Europe and I got my back pain which begun in Swiss and got aggravated and spread all around my right leg. The pain was really unbearable and we came back to Abu Dhabi and did MRI and consulted 4 doctors. They all had different opinions, like take rest for one month, do traction and IFT.\nI got a lot of opinions from my friends like going to Kerala for Ayurveda massage and advise to go to several doctors. I was totally confused and my pain started playing games with me like sometimes I feel no pain and the next minute the pain is at its peak. So, totally confused, we came for our summer vacation to Chennai as planned; a full busy family vacation schedule for 10 days. But casually visited Dr. Ashwin for an opinion and after seeing my MRI he mentioned a word that changed my mind. He told me that if I was a family member of his, he would strongly urge me to take the surgery as my condition is of that I was going to have a paralyzed leg and this could happen any time, sort of like a time bomb attached to my back. That word changed my life and I agreed to go for the operation.\nTotal scenario changed. Our family vacation became a lifesaving event instead. I got admitted and Dr. Ashwin and Dr. PhaniKiran did operation and that day evening Dr. Ashwin asked me to stand and start walking. I was so happy that my shooting pain had gone completely.\nNow 14 days has passed after the surgery and now I\u2019m a completely new man.\nDr. Ashwin is a great human and he took me as his family member and advised otherwise. I might have gone to Kerala for the Ayurvedic massage or some other choices because I was totally against the operation 15 days ago.\nEven until the last minute before the operation, I got a lot of phone calls saying that I shouldn\u2019t do the surgery. Even my brother from USA had asked me to abort because he thought it was a risk.\nBut now me, my family and my friends are happy that I became normal because of Dr. Ashwin.\nThanks Dr. Ashwin. I have no words to thank you please keep it up and I wish you will make lot of people happy by relieving their physical pain.\n",

Post Covid when I started working out, my knees weren\u2019t supportive. I started feeling heaviness around my knees when I jog or jump\n\nMy experience: Ojas hospital building gets more than 5* for the interiors and architecture. You will feel entering a 7* hotel. All staffs are very kind and professional. They answer every question you ask without slacking.\n\nI had to wait for 45 mins approx. for the consultation (this is ok because doctors schedules can\u2019t be on the point). When I met the doctor he was very kind and attentive in listening to my problem statement. He recommended x-ray to diagnose my issue.\n\nWhen the x-ray was out he prescribed physiotherapy and mild medications. I am not convinced with his diagnosis or his explanation for my problem. I have pain in both my knees while the doctor gave the root cause only for one knee which I am not convinced. His explanation wasn\u2019t detailed to a layman person.\n\nWish doctor explained me clearly the cause and the diagnosis statement. May be it\u2019s too early for him to conclude?\n\nI am glad for others who are very much satisfied with his treatment while am looking for such good experience. Hope during my next review session he will explain things more clearly",

But your smile, your kindness, your humanity, your treatment and your advice have given me a lot of hope for recovery. I already feel better and I will continue the exercises you suggested. I really appreciated the quality of care provided by all the staff at your clinic. The cleanliness of the premises is wonderful. It would be good for all patients if all hospitals and clinics and if all doctors and care staff were like you and like your team in our Mother India. As planned, I will come back to meet you next month for another consultation. Thank you very much Sir. Mrs VEL Tilagavady",

It was a grade I tear back then.\nI had visited one of the leading orthopaedic surgeon in Chennai, they asked me to rest for a week and get back to my workout routine. Days flew but my pain kept on increasing. Then I decided to go to Apollo and got my knee examined by the chief doctor there and he suggested that I go in for some IFT physiotherapy.\nThat is when I searched online about good physiotherapy centres and OJAS was rated one among the best and I chose to get it done here.\nI had visited Ojas in the month of June.\nThe staff there are very kind and courteous, they suggested that I could once show my reports to Dr.P.R.Ashwin just to get a more clear understanding on what has to be done.\nThis was the time I lost all hopes that I would ever recover from the injury and get back to my normal workout routine.( leave alone workout, standing for more than 10 mins was a very big deal for me)\nThe very first time I met Dr.Ashwin , I was very much motivated.\nHe spreads a lot of positivity which according to me is what every person under pain requires. He educated me on what exactly I'm undergoing and he asked me to give it sometime since I was too young for a surgery. He asked me to believe in the natural healing process(unlike doctors who readily want to perform a surgery).\nHe later along with his team analysed my problem in detail and \nsuggested that I should go in for an Ultra sound guided Injection in my hamstring.Within 10 days I found myself to be in a better position that what I was, I was given some more physiotherapy which Dr.Ashwin was very kind enough to guide personally.\nNow I am back to my old fit self.\nAll thanks to Dr.Ashwin and his team.\nNow my entire family visits only him for any orthopaedic issues.\nIt is very important to fall in the right hands and feel confident about your doctor.\nUnlike most hospitals where they give appointments to all patients at once just to keep a crowded atmosphere, here at Ojas even the appointments are so sorted and you aren't made to wait very long (which is important , because it gets hard to sit an wait for hours when you are already sick)\nDr.Ashwin has a very modern approach to his treatment.\nHe makes sure you get the best available treatment.\nHe makes sure that there is a proper check on his patients via his staff.\nA special mention to his staff for dealing with patients with a lot of patience and a kind manner.\nYou can undoubtedly visit Ashwin doctor for your orthopaedic issues and I'm sure you would relate to everything I have said.\n",

The assurance on his face definitely increased my confidence and I realized, that with God\u2019s Grace, I am in the right hands. To be more precise, I have no other option, but, to attribute my special appreciation for his pain management treatment. Not once, did I feel any pain or discomfort, after my surgery. With lot of patience, he will always spend his valuable time with the patient, duly explaining him in detail and making him feel at home. Hats off to the doctor!! \nAt this juncture, I assume that may be my meeting with an accident, is a god given opportunity for me, to meet a person like Dr.Ashwin Vijay in my life!\n\nIt is always said that good people always get associated with good people.  That is why Dr.Ashwin Vijay has been blessed with a kind & capable person, like Mr. Jose, as his secretary.  I have never heard of any Doctor\u2019s secretary giving a call to the patient regularly and finding out how he is doing. \nFrom day one, till this date, Mr.Jose has been always rendering his service & support through frequent & timely phone calls. I am sure, definitely Mr.Jose is one of the valid reasons for Dr.Ashwin Vijay\u2019s success story.\n\nIn this context, it will be only fair on my part to wish Dr.Ashwin Vijay and his secretary Mr.Jose, all success in their journey.\n\nIn nutshell, without any second thought, I will definitely recommend Dr.Ashwin Vijay as a NUMBER 1 CHOICE for any orthopaedic consultation.",

Met Dr. Ashwin to consult my son\u2019s shoulder dislocation problem on our vacation during March and he suggested some good advice to keep him fit and continue his games.\nLast month (July) we went to Europe and I got my back pain which begun in Swiss and got aggravated and spread all around my right leg. The pain was really unbearable and we came back to Abu Dhabi and did MRI and consulted 4 doctors. They all had different opinions, like take rest for one month, do traction and IFT.\nI got a lot of opinions from my friends like going to Kerala for Ayurveda massage and advise to go to several doctors. I was totally confused and my pain started playing games with me like sometimes I feel no pain and the next minute the pain is at its peak. So, totally confused, we came for our summer vacation to Chennai as planned; a full busy family vacation schedule for 10 days. But casually visited Dr. Ashwin for an opinion and after seeing my MRI he mentioned a word that changed my mind. He told me that if I was a family member of his, he would strongly urge me to take the surgery as my condition is of that I was going to have a paralyzed leg and this could happen any time, sort of like a time bomb attached to my back. That word changed my life and I agreed to go for the operation.\nTotal scenario changed. Our family vacation became a lifesaving event instead. I got admitted and Dr. Ashwin and Dr. PhaniKiran did operation and that day evening Dr. Ashwin asked me to stand and start walking. I was so happy that my shooting pain had gone completely.\nNow 14 days has passed after the surgery and now I\u2019m a completely new man.\nDr. Ashwin is a great human and he took me as his family member and advised otherwise. I might have gone to Kerala for the Ayurvedic massage or some other choices because I was totally against the operation 15 days ago.\nEven until the last minute before the operation, I got a lot of phone calls saying that I shouldn\u2019t do the surgery. Even my brother from USA had asked me to abort because he thought it was a risk.\nBut now me, my family and my friends are happy that I became normal because of Dr. Ashwin.\nThanks Dr. Ashwin. I have no words to thank you please keep it up and I wish you will make lot of people happy by relieving their physical pain.\n",

Post Covid when I started working out, my knees weren\u2019t supportive. I started feeling heaviness around my knees when I jog or jump\n\nMy experience: Ojas hospital building gets more than 5* for the interiors and architecture. You will feel entering a 7* hotel. All staffs are very kind and professional. They answer every question you ask without slacking.\n\nI had to wait for 45 mins approx. for the consultation (this is ok because doctors schedules can\u2019t be on the point). When I met the doctor he was very kind and attentive in listening to my problem statement. He recommended x-ray to diagnose my issue.\n\nWhen the x-ray was out he prescribed physiotherapy and mild medications. I am not convinced with his diagnosis or his explanation for my problem. I have pain in both my knees while the doctor gave the root cause only for one knee which I am not convinced. His explanation wasn\u2019t detailed to a layman person.\n\nWish doctor explained me clearly the cause and the diagnosis statement. May be it\u2019s too early for him to conclude?\n\nI am glad for others who are very much satisfied with his treatment while am looking for such good experience. Hope during my next review session he will explain things more clearly",

This was a one of kind experience that all patients should get to feel how comforting it is. First of all you get greeted in with a smile from the reception team and all staff are so friendly and ready to assist with a smile and urgency. No long waits, your good if your there at the time you have fixed the appointment . Then you get greeted by Dr Ashwin with a smile and such a warm and friendly welcome when you enter the consulting room. I was having an issue with my shoulder for about 6 months, the first thing Dr Ashwin said is not to worry and he instilled confidence in a very friendly manner and provided me with the next course of the identifying the issue and also the treatment. Went there after completing the tests and Dr Ashiwn explained what was the issue and also how he is going about the treatment. I was very happy that he mentioned he did not want to do a surgery which is not the case with most places since they don\u2019t hesitate to put the knife on you for reasons best known.  The consultation charges are very reasonable given that you get the wow factor when you visit the clinic and also the medicines are provided by them at a very reasonable price. This is one place I felt comfortable that it was not a place to make money but to provide best of class service to patients that come to Ojas Ortho.",

I learnt about DR Ashwin from one of my friends and had an appointment with him on 04/04/2022, He told me that though I had some physiological issues, the pain was mainly aggravated by stress. He suggested yoga as the MAGIC KEY to all my pains. I was surprised and wasn't sure of what to expect. But I believed that it would be the best way ahead as he reassured me that things would be better soon with yoga.  Both me and my husband are every so grateful to DR Ashwin for all his help.  \n\nGod Bless!\n\n",

He is always full of positive energy and immediately makes you feel better. His treatment is very ********** minimalistic and quick. He is very encouraging about running as he himself is a runner.

He asked us to wait for 10 days before taking up the procedure, and we also had frequent follow ups during this period. We were able to sense a personal care and commitment from Dr. Ashwin during this period. He was very open to our questions and answering them all sincerely.\n\nAfter 10 days, we had the surgery at Astra, Velachery. Surgery went very smooth, and my wife had a very good improvement in her knee with the help of physio exercises. After a month from the surgery, she is now able to walk without any support. My sincere thanks to Dr. Ashwin and all staff at Ojas and Astra.\n\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Ashwin.",

He doesn't need an MRI to diagnose. By mere observation he is able to pin point the problem and the MRI merely confirms his findings. Thereafter he proactively works on treating the patient and the recovery time forecast by him is as accurate as his honoring scheduled appointments! There is no lengthy waiting time to meet the Dr and this is handled to clinical perfection. There is no attempt to exaggerate the patient's problems and his charges are very reasonable. I will any day recommend this Dr to anyone with ortho problems.\n",

If this was originally not encouraged by doctor and his assistants, then it is really good.\n\nAlso the doctor\u2019s assistant intervened our conversation within 10 minutes saying there are \u201cmany patients waiting\u201d.
