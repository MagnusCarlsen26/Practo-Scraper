No complaints on doctors skills but the clinic is only run with profit motive. They charge you Rs 100 for registration and give you a simple paper folder to show expenses.

I'll never visit this clinic or recommend such a money first administration again. A skilled doctor does not mean you can can charge unnecessarily. ",
