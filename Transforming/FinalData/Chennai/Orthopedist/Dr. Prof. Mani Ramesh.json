He also looped in a Plastic Surgeon and entered the OT with no hope of getting my finger back. But, Dr. Mani Ramesh saved my finger and I am completely satisfied with the treatment and we are associated with Prashanth hospital since 2012 and until now, we go there for anything and everything.

Since my bone also got cut (almost amputation stage) Dr. Mani Ramesh came to the hospital at 12:30 in the night (SUNDAY) to see my condition and explained me thoroughly about the injury patiently at that time and fixed a surgery the next day. He also looped in a Plastic Surgeon and entered the OT with no hope of getting my finger back. But, Dr. Mani Ramesh saved my finger and I am completely satisfied with the treatment and we are associated with Prashanth hospital since 2012 and until now, we go there for anything and everything. Hats off to you Sir.",
