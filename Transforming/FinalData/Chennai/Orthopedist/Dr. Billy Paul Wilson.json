Few doctors recommended drugs(CollaFlex PRO) and pain killers for the problem. Fortunately they recommended  MIOT hospital Chennai for the procedure after several consultations. Thank God I met Dr. Billy, he advised me to go for rehab exercises and complete rest instead of the surgical procedure.  It worked. Now I am Ok with the pain and back to almost normal conditions.\n\nThe way he treats his patients is really amazing. Lots of professionalism and sincerity in the discussions with all his patients. Explanations of the health issue are really simple and fantastic. I have completed 6 consultations with him at MIOT hospital Chennai.\n\nThanks to Dr. Billy Paul Wilson.",

Few doctors recommended drugs(CollaFlex PRO) and pain killers for the problem. Fortunately they recommended  MIOT hospital Chennai for the procedure after several consultations. Thank God I met Dr. Billy, he advised me to go for rehab exercises and complete rest instead of the surgical procedure.  It worked. Now I am Ok with the pain and back to almost normal conditions.\n\nThe way he treats his patients is really amazing. Lots of professionalism and sincerity in the discussions with all his patients. Explanations of the health issue are really simple and fantastic. I have completed 6 consultations with him at MIOT hospital Chennai.\n\nThanks to Dr. Billy Paul Wilson.",
