When my baby fell sick in the middle of the night and was down with very high fever we were quite far from doc. At that time of emergency we consulted nearby pedarcs and constantly  got doc Kalpana's support. She was answering all our queries and showing her support. Next day was a Sunday, and as I am only comfortable with doc Kalpana we went to The hospital where she practices. Even though she wasn't around physically she made sure my baby got the right treatment. Her words comfort you and her advices makes sure that you follow the right path. I actually stay very far from doc but I still dont mind travelling all the way to see her. * ** **** ***** ** **** *** ***** *** *** **** ********** *** ** ********* Thank you doc! ",

                "review_text": "We had opted for the premium package (suite room) in Motherhood hospital for delivery of our baby. Few days before we paid an advance for the suite room and blocked the same. I was admitted in the hospital on 19th and my son was born on same day. The following are the issues which made the stay extremely uncomfortable and also make us shocked at how Motherhood has handled situations. \n\n1. Paediatric department: the moment our son was born he was taken to NICU and cleared as healthy. Throughout checkups from Nov 19 till today he was cleared as fine by the doctors. It was only today, when WE noticed and asked, the doctor realises that his feet are curved and he has some positional talips. The doctor also admitted that it needs physiotherapy or else it can set in the wrong direction. W* *** ******* ** **** **** ** *** ** ******** **** ***** ** **** ******* **** **** ** *** *** ** **** ***** *** ****** ********** This would have been a permanent damage had it not been for us noticing this, and the situation would have been very different. ** *** **** **** ** ** ***** **** **** ******* ** *** **** ** * **** **** ******* ****** \nThe doctor also was a bit unsure about whether or not he has jaundice. First she said he does, then she said no. We did not get any comfort from her diagnosis at all. \n\n2. Nursing department: The nursing department is absolutely unprofessional. \n- The nurses never turn up on time. Once I was shivering in the night and almost convulsing, the nurse took her own sweet time, then she tried to do her own diagnoses, at our insistence she called the doctor. The whole incident took almost an hour. \n-most of the time the nurses have serious attitude. One of them came and started shaking the baby's head like anything and said that's how you stimulate and shake the baby. \n- they came at 4am to check the baby's weight in his first night, when neither his dad nor I have slept in hours. \n- they came the day before discharge again at 4am switching on all lights and taking away extra meds to prep for discharge. Even at 4pm we are still not discharged so did not understand the need for that. She didn't stop despite being told many times. She went ahead. .\n- My attending doctor (Kavya) also noticed that there are never any nurses around even when she comes in. Every process is extremely delayed. When she came they had still not taken the bandage off because it took them one and a half hours to get a pair of gloves. \n- These instances are after repeatedly informing the Nursing superintendent that we are unhappy with everything so far. There are multiple instances too many to cite but all of which made it a terrible experience. \n\nInsurance and billing: We were not informed when we enquired about the suite room that it's not covered in insurance. If we had been aware we would probably have gone with the regular room. This would have been a huge hit for someone who did not have sufficient ready cash. We were forced to agree because I had only one hour for surgery and no time to do these discussions. \n\nExcept for Dr Kavya, Dr Sonali and Dr. Aarthi, every other experience here has been intolerable.\n\nThe AC is the recovery room was leaking with a bucket below it. This is an arms distance from where I am recovering from a surgery and where my few minutes old son is kept. I cannot imagine the hygiene maintained in this case.\u00a0\n\n\nThe AC in the preoperative room was not working at all. I was sweating and my BP also had dropped and I almost fainted.\u00a0\n\n\nThe nurse on the first night of my stay spilt half my meds while trying to inject them into my drips. I had Iv fluid down my hands, and medicines on the floor because she was either clumsy or sleepy.\u00a0\n\n\nPrior to my admission I wanted to speak to a gynaec. I tried motherhood line and it took one hour for a clear communication with the gynaec. The call back we received was twenty minutes after we left for the hospital. I had to remind them it's a hospital and not a hotel and they should have an emergency line.",

I am a new mother and very likely to have my own experience, doctor has always been there for me at odd working hours, whether its a saturday or monday she is always next her patients. When my baby fell sick in the middle of the night and was down with very high fever we were quite far from doc. At that time of emergency we consulted nearby pedarcs and constantly  got doc Kalpana's support. She was answering all our queries and showing her support. Next day was a Sunday, and as I am only comfortable with doc Kalpana we went to The hospital where she practices. Even though she wasn't around physically she made sure my baby got the right treatment. Her words comfort you and her advices makes sure that you follow the right path. I actually stay very far from doc but I still dont mind travelling all the way to see her. * ** **** ***** ** **** *** ***** *** *** **** ********** *** ** ********* Thank you doc! ",

                "review_text": "We had opted for the premium package (suite room) in Motherhood hospital for delivery of our baby. Few days before we paid an advance for the suite room and blocked the same. I was admitted in the hospital on 19th and my son was born on same day. The following are the issues which made the stay extremely uncomfortable and also make us shocked at how Motherhood has handled situations. \n\n1. Paediatric department: the moment our son was born he was taken to NICU and cleared as healthy. Throughout checkups from Nov 19 till today he was cleared as fine by the doctors. It was only today, when WE noticed and asked, the doctor realises that his feet are curved and he has some positional talips. The doctor also admitted that it needs physiotherapy or else it can set in the wrong direction. W* *** ******* ** **** **** ** *** ** ******** **** ***** ** **** ******* **** **** ** *** *** ** **** ***** *** ****** ********** This would have been a permanent damage had it not been for us noticing this, and the situation would have been very different. ** *** **** **** ** ** ***** **** **** ******* ** *** **** ** * **** **** ******* ****** \nThe doctor also was a bit unsure about whether or not he has jaundice. First she said he does, then she said no. We did not get any comfort from her diagnosis at all. \n\n2. Nursing department: The nursing department is absolutely unprofessional. \n- The nurses never turn up on time. Once I was shivering in the night and almost convulsing, the nurse took her own sweet time, then she tried to do her own diagnoses, at our insistence she called the doctor. The whole incident took almost an hour. \n-most of the time the nurses have serious attitude. One of them came and started shaking the baby's head like anything and said that's how you stimulate and shake the baby. \n- they came at 4am to check the baby's weight in his first night, when neither his dad nor I have slept in hours. \n- they came the day before discharge again at 4am switching on all lights and taking away extra meds to prep for discharge. Even at 4pm we are still not discharged so did not understand the need for that. She didn't stop despite being told many times. She went ahead. .\n- My attending doctor (Kavya) also noticed that there are never any nurses around even when she comes in. Every process is extremely delayed. When she came they had still not taken the bandage off because it took them one and a half hours to get a pair of gloves. \n- These instances are after repeatedly informing the Nursing superintendent that we are unhappy with everything so far. There are multiple instances too many to cite but all of which made it a terrible experience. \n\nInsurance and billing: We were not informed when we enquired about the suite room that it's not covered in insurance. If we had been aware we would probably have gone with the regular room. This would have been a huge hit for someone who did not have sufficient ready cash. We were forced to agree because I had only one hour for surgery and no time to do these discussions. \n\nExcept for Dr Kavya, Dr Sonali and Dr. Aarthi, every other experience here has been intolerable.\n\nThe AC is the recovery room was leaking with a bucket below it. This is an arms distance from where I am recovering from a surgery and where my few minutes old son is kept. I cannot imagine the hygiene maintained in this case.\u00a0\n\n\nThe AC in the preoperative room was not working at all. I was sweating and my BP also had dropped and I almost fainted.\u00a0\n\n\nThe nurse on the first night of my stay spilt half my meds while trying to inject them into my drips. I had Iv fluid down my hands, and medicines on the floor because she was either clumsy or sleepy.\u00a0\n\n\nPrior to my admission I wanted to speak to a gynaec. I tried motherhood line and it took one hour for a clear communication with the gynaec. The call back we received was twenty minutes after we left for the hospital. I had to remind them it's a hospital and not a hotel and they should have an emergency line.",
