When I contacted that doctor, he said if it was vaccination, he was available, but for this, only video consultation was possible!!! I felt really disappointed in his attitude. Then, I searched in Practo and luckily came across Dr.Priya. She gave an appointment immediately. She was very courteous and was trying her best to pacify my kid who got grumpy getting into the clinic :-)Recently, I took him for vaccination. Infact, she went one step ahead and adviced us that Meningococcal vaccine is not required for our kid and Flu Booster should be fine. She shared couple of articles as well. The other doctor was insisting us to take the Meningococcal vaccine prior to the Flu Booster. Anyway, Dr.Priya proved she was a better and more importantly an ethical doctor even if the other doctor had more experience than her. I don't want to name that doctor. But I definitely wanted to  do a compare!!!Me and my wife felt, Dr.Priya is a compassionate doctor whom we can trust and definitely travel a long distance for consultation.Thanks Dr.Priya. Please stay rooted and please keep up this humaneness. More parents will keep coming to you. Really happy we found you for our Dharun!!!With Lots of Thanks,Karunakaran",

I consult her for every single and silly thing - when my baby didn't sleep and when he slept for a long time, when he had loose motion and when he had constipation, when a chair fell on him and when he fell down on the floor, for cold, cough and even when I missed the vaccination by one day. Being a new mother is a difficult phase for everyone and Dr.Priya helped me through it and never once got irked with all my silly doubts.  \n\nBest part about the doctor is, she will connect with the kids instantly and mine always felt comfortable with her. Would definitely recommend her to everyone especially for infants and toddlers.",

When I contacted that doctor, he said if it was vaccination, he was available, but for this, only video consultation was possible!!! I felt really disappointed in his attitude. Then, I searched in Practo and luckily came across Dr.Priya. She gave an appointment immediately. She was very courteous and was trying her best to pacify my kid who got grumpy getting into the clinic :-)Recently, I took him for vaccination. Infact, she went one step ahead and adviced us that Meningococcal vaccine is not required for our kid and Flu Booster should be fine. She shared couple of articles as well. The other doctor was insisting us to take the Meningococcal vaccine prior to the Flu Booster. Anyway, Dr.Priya proved she was a better and more importantly an ethical doctor even if the other doctor had more experience than her. I don't want to name that doctor. But I definitely wanted to  do a compare!!!Me and my wife felt, Dr.Priya is a compassionate doctor whom we can trust and definitely travel a long distance for consultation.Thanks Dr.Priya. Please stay rooted and please keep up this humaneness. More parents will keep coming to you. Really happy we found you for our Dharun!!!With Lots of Thanks,Karunakaran",
