"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Consulted Dr Srinivas 4 years back for my kid constipation issue. We are happy about the treatment. Before I consult him We consulted several doctors but no good news. 
We consulted him again recently  after 4 years for my kid IBS issues. We consulted many pediatrics and might have visited more than 30 times , even gastro specialist. No one could identify it a IBS.  The treatment is good. The issue is reduced by about 75 %.  Hopefully We would find complete solution soon.  Good doctor. Listen to patient case history.  Spend enough time with patient to diagnosis.  ",2020-11-21 19:47:45,False,True,Prakash,,,
