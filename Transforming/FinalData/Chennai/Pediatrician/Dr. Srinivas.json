Before I consult him We consulted several doctors but no good news. \nWe consulted him again recently  after 4 years for my kid IBS issues. We consulted many pediatrics and might have visited more than 30 times , even gastro specialist. No one could identify it a IBS.  The treatment is good. The issue is reduced by about 75 %.  Hopefully We would find complete solution soon.  Good doctor. Listen to patient case history.  Spend enough time with patient to diagnosis.  ",
