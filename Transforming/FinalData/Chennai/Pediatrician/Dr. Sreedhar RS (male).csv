For this reason while booking appointment it is very clearly mentioned that there may be a waiting time  upto 60 min.Also during the pandemic we cannot allow patients to crowd in the waiting room. So best is to wait in an open area outside clinic and come in when called  ...I totally understand that its uncomfortable especially with kids but it goes a long way to prevent  transmission of corona ...Thank you for your feedback...,2020-11-24T11:17:46+0000,Dr. Sreedhar RS
