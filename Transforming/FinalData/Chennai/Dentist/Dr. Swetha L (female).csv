,,0,0,YES,Excellent consultation and treatment given by Dr.Swetha. I was advised to get root canal treatment and it was done at an ease. I m completely pain free after the treatment. Right treatment at the right time by the right qualified doctor always helps. Thanks to her team also. Reasonable fees also,2023-10-21 12:49:10,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
,,0,0,YES,Recently went to Partha dental clinic for cleaning my teeth with the coupon given by my friend. Dr.Swetha did the cleaning and itâ€™s absolutely free worth of Rs.2000. They suggested to get my decayed tooth filled. Will get it done for sure in the same clinic. Thanks to the doctor and staff,2023-10-06 15:13:49,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
