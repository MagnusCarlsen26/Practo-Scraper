"Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Value for money,","Artificial Teeth,",0,0,YES,"Dr Monica is friendly, considerate, kind yet highly professional
She explains, discusses before laying out a detailed time bound treatment schedule
The procedure, cost, & medication helps you make an informed decision
She removed an old cap which had outlived its utility, identified a rotting tooth and suggested a couple of options
I chose bridging of two teeth 
She took an x-ray, showed me the extent of decay and infection before listing out the options which helped me take an informed decision
The temporary cap & medication before the next visit for recap and bridging, will help me deal with the infection & discomfort
After removing the cap, she inspected the adjacent teeth which is infected & rotting and needs RCT or bridging or both. 
The entire experience was painless( with LA of course) 
She has taken the tooth impressions and will call me to fix the next appointment
