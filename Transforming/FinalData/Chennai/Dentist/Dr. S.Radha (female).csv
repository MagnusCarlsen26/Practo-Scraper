"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Straightening Teeth (Conventional Braces),Dental Checkup (General),",0,0,YES,I had first visited the clinic for a general dental checkup. Dr.Radha was very friendly and she identified my issues and explained to me in detail. I had previously worn braces but that treatment was not successful. There were a lot of gaps in the upper jaw which led to further movement of the teeth  and the teeth had started to protrude. I was very hesitant to wear a permanent braces again. She understood me so well and she came up with a different treatment plan. I am under her treatment and I can see a huge difference. I am really thankful to Dr.Radha for her patience and dedication. The clinic premises is also maintained really well and the treatment room is spick and span. ,2021-03-04 03:13:33,False,True,Vyshnav deve,,,
