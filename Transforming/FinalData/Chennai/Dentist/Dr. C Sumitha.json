She performed the treatment on time in the given appointment schedule. \nClinic was also maintained cleanly with all necessary equipments.\nThank you so much Dr. Sumi for all your timely services inspite of this pandemic situation.",

Couple of doctors from my native said tough case. \n\nShe assessed my case and considering my travel plans she had performed the procedure (withing 1 hour) with assessment 10min,  break 20m, local sedation  5m, break 5m, extraction 15m, completion and post extraction care in 5mins. \n\nPremise is also neat and hygienic with adequate amenities for X-Ray, Sanitizing the tools etc.\n\nCharges were unbeatable compared to other doctors even in my town. (Kovilpattti - South TN)\n\nThis is my second visit to her. Previous one was Root Canal and Cap. in 3 sitting I guess, couldn't recollect exact flow but that was almost closer to American Dental standards which I got after Insurance coverage. (in US for 15times of the cost what she charged) \n\nWish she is located near to my town or at-least come as visiting Doctor to a dental clinic here.",

I religiously followed the medication provided and other oral practices recommended by doctor and within 3 days it was almost 70% resolved.. My gums now are looking so much healthier .. I do not have any swelling or bleeding in my gums anymore..
