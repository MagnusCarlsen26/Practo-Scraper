I went with the complaints of missing teeth and sensitive.

Dr.Sanjay Jacob is very attentive when I was verbalizing my discomforts .

 He explained me the solutions in a very simple sentences that I can understand easily.

 I agreed for there treatment plan and opted for implant for missing teeth and for sensitive just they suggested a toothpaste it really worked.

Besides no unnecessary Imaging or Lab test.

Their time management is perfect.

On the day of my implant the implantology's quickly recapped the plan and procedure, preprocedural vitals are checked , within a short time frame maybe less than 40 minutes he finished fixing for two teeth.

Reassurance, post care and follow-ups are promptly reminded from clinic.

Overall I thank the entire dental team of Dr.Sanjay Jacobs clinic and I hope they will maintain their high quality of work and professionalism.

Spent 2 years and lot of money to correct my teeth allignment. My issue started back within 6 mobths after removing the braces. The Essix retainer which the doctor forcefully suggested didnt help. When i approached him back with the issue, he was very rude and not even ready to listen completely. He kept shouting at me. ** *** ** **** ** ***** ********** *** *** **** *** ************* ",2022-08-25 06:15:37,False,False,Verified Patient,"Hello Maam, hope alls well. Firstly, ‚Äúin your feedback‚Äù, you did not mention the fact that you had previously already undergone a orthodontic treatment with some other dentist, way back, before you even met me. This so called ‚Äú complete orthodontic treatment‚Äù involved the extraction of ‚Äúfour‚Äù of your premolar teeth, the orthodontic treatment that you had undergone was highly disappointing and cannot be considered a proper orthodontic treatment without any form of retention.

In 2019 November, when we first met, for your orthodontic treatment, you had already extracted 4 teeth, and extraction spaces were all closed, your teeth were proclined outwards with spacing in the front teeth, lip incompetency and a convex profile, ‚Äúcompletely relapsed‚Äù from the previous orthodontic history with hardly any spaces left to retract or push your teeth inwards, but you still insisted on wanting your teeth to be pushed inside and change your profile, it was clearly explained to you that, it cannot be done, since all your first premolars were already removed and extraction spaces were closed, all that can be done is to make use of the mild spacing in between your centrals and laterals  to retrude or push back your teeth as much as possible, clubbed max with some proximal stripping, which wont improve your profile, but will only close the existing mild spaces and push the teeth inwards to a mild degree, not to the extent of a creating a profile change. For which you had completely agreed, and gave me the green signal to go ahead. i had done and finished, what i said i would do to the best of my ability.

Following the treatment, before removal of the braces, i had specifically asked you if your ok and satisfied, you said everything is fine. 

Secondly Maam, On the day of essix retainers delivery, which by the way, wasnt ‚Äúforcefully‚Äù given to you as you claim to say ( Retention is a mandatory part of any orthodontic post treatment, that was clearly explained to you before the start of the orthodontic treatment and the fact that, lower lingual retention being a part of the package whereas  essix ‚Äúisnt‚Äù) for which you had created a big ruckuss regarding the payment of the essix retainer, and finally you went on to pay for it, and also slammed the door on your way out. 

Yesterday, after 6 months of post treatment, When you came to me, i did not find any space opening, with any of the teeth, though you kept insisting the upper teeth r proclined and there r spacings, for which i repeatedly kept telling you that it isnt possible since, your retainer that was given to you back in 2022 February , ‚Äústill fits your teeth perfectly‚Äù. If the teeth, were to have, relapsed like you told me, the retainer wont fit at all, and 
Thirdly Maam, it wasnt me trying to be rude to you, infact it seemed like you had walked in, with the very intent of creating an altercation, i tried to explain things to you, in a calm and composed manner, but you weren‚Äôt even trying to listen, instead infringed into and stopped me from whatever conversation i was trying to have with you, and saying things like, ‚Äú i have done a big mistake, spending my money on this orthodontic treatment ‚Äú. Barging in and accusing a person for no reason, is not accepted nor done, maam.
We have all your pre treatment records, to very well prove all that i have said.
Moving on from here, lets not take it back and forth out here, if you have anything to discuss, your always welcome and i am always open to a healthy conversation and will be always ready to help you out in whatever way i can.
And Finally, please think twice before trying to malalign and defame an individual. Thanks maam, have a good day.",2022-08-26T08:34:40+0000,Dr. Sanjay Jacob
