Ever since Dr. Sarvanan has been closely monitoring the development of my teeth and it's reshaping.\n\nHe has a beautifully designed dental clinic in Virugambakkam. He treats you like his very own kid and is the most soft hearted dentist for me to have ever come across. I call him up and have my appointment fixed according to my convenience considering I am from Hyderabad. He makes sure to cater that time to me always. I remember he chose to treat me and finish up my course inspite of not having the capability to pay him in full during one particular visit. \n\nHe'll be my go to dentist moving forward no matter which part of India I stay in. A dedicated, humble, professional and personal dentist to all his clients. Kudos to Dr. B. Saravanan",
