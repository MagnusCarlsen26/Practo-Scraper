She answers to all your problems and doubts without any hesitation. I've started RCT and gonna fix dental crown in upcoming sitting. I thought I can drop in a review after the procedure is over. I trust them and it made me to write now itself. Anyways I'll update my review after few weeks. If your objective is care and best treatment then you can blindly visit them for sure.True vfm.

Unlike other doctors she doesn't push the work if some one else walks in without an appt. Pl make sure u confirm the appt before u reach the clinic. ",

I was worried about it.I thought of getting an second opinion and I found Dr.Vesta samuel from Facebook. I visited her . she cooly said there is no need to extract the tooth. I was surprised. Then she did a post and core and gave me crown which looks very natural. I am very happy and great full to her . Thank you doc. I would recommend this doctor for dental treatments in a better and less stressfull way.",

After hearing abt Dr.Vesta from the internet, I had the courage to go meet her. I underwent 2 root canals. It was like a cake walk,compared to the root canal that I did with a mother dentist.There was no pain during the treatment.\nThe way she injected anaesthesia was excellent, I just felt the liquid going in.Earlier dentist use to give anaesthesia which is very painful. I truly admire her soft medical skills. Highly recommended fr painless dentistry.",

Dr. Vesta,  Thank You for giving me my smile back !!. \n\nI was little apprehensive to visit a Dentist - this never had any particular reasons neither in the past nor in the present associated. It may be due to a perception or whatsoever. Finally, when I decided to meet a Dentist, I surfed the internet to find a good dentist and came across Dr. Vesta's profile with glowing reviews. \n\nDr. greeted me warmly, made me feel relax, understood my dental problems and started diagnosis. Dr gave a summary of the diagnosis - explain how the procedure is done .. Dr. was extremely caring and was making me at ease during the course of the treatment. \n\nI am very glad for the service provided and the overall experience. \n\nDr. Vesta - Thank You so much.\n",

But Dr. Vesta had a discussion with me before the start of the treatment and she clearly explained the course of treatment which other dentist fail to do. She is a non commercial doctor, I would  say this because other dentist will ask u pay the entire treatment cost in one stroke. But she does not collect money like that . First month we need to pay for the kit alone. From second month onwards we can split the cost as EMI. She and her orthodontist does a great job. Highly professional.",

I visited stunning smiles clinic simply to ask the dentist  to extract my broken tooth. But she saved my tooth with Root canal treatment followed by apicectomy and capping without damage to my wallet. Whereas in a corporate clinic I was asked to pay Rs.24000 in one shot for the same treatment. But Dr. Vesta did the same for Rs.6000 in installments. Very economical. Highly recommended fr her perfectionism. ",
