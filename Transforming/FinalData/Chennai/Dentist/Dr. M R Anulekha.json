Doctor was extremely genuine in explaining the treatment process and the timeline. She dint rush or force me to the treatment, made me understand the pros and cons and the decision was left to me. I underwent fillings for my decayed teeth which was precisely explained. This is the first time I'm coming across a doctor spending so much time in explaining the patient about the treatment and understanding what the patient really wants. Post treatment, I'm very much comfortable. And they are checking the comfort of the patient after three treatment as well.\n Really satisfied with the treatment and totally worth every penny spent. I would definitely recommend to all my friends and family. Thank you doctor \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
