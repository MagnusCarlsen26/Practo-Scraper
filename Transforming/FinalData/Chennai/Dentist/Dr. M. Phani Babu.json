The receptionists and dental assistants are very efficient, thoughtful, kind, helpful and follow-ups are wonderful. Every time we call or come into Dent Eazee, we can expect prompt, courteous, cheerful, gentle service! They have the latest state of the art dental equipment *** ******* *** ****** *************.

He provided a thorough explanation of the surgery's choices. For the procedure, we chose general anesthesia. We were already aware from prior visits that Dr. Phani and his team would do a fantastic job making the procedure painless for the child and it went exactly as anticipated. Even though the surgery took two hours, our trust in the doctor made us feel secure. After the procedure, the doctor and the clinic personnel patiently answered all of our questions and assisted in my child's quick recovery. We would like to thank him for his technical prowess and thoughtful attention to the patient's dental issues.",
