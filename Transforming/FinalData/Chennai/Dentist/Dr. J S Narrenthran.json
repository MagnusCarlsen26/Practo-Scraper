Feeling totally better after the treatment and felt free to ask my dental doubts. Who feels RCT is a pain pls visit js dental. Finally economical and quality treatment with a clear explanation.",

Also I have to mention that I was charged less cost comparatively. A friendly doctor who understands our problem and explains the root cause in detailed manner. Gives us a permanent solution and treatment, definitely not a temporary solution. So kind and advice us in a friendly way in taking care of our teeth and health. Though it's far from my residence still I prefer this Doctor for dental related. *** **** ****** *** *** ****** *****",

Also I have to mention that I was charged less cost comparatively. A friendly doctor who understands our problem and explains the root cause in detailed manner. Gives us a permanent solution and treatment, definitely not a temporary solution. So kind and advice us in a friendly way in taking care of our teeth and health.
