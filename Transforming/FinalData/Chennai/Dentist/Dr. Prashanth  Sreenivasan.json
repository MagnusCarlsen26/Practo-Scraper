Called them on the phone and Dr. Prashanth & Dr. Syed were good enough to set me an appointment and go over the steps. I met Dr. Syed, Dr. Prashanth, Dr. Bharath  & Dr. Andrew (in the order) during the procedures.  It started with extraction, four root canals, cap prep, two bridges and a cap on my molar.  I finally got done last week after almost two months of all procedures (step-by-step). These guys may look young but let me tell you, they are **** ************* *** experienced. With my health condition, Dr. Prashanth was able to set  up my appointments accordingly.  All of them were courteous and Dr. Prashanth is expert in it :). Hands down, these guys are the  experts.  They know what they're doing and they do it correct .I would definitely recommend them to my family/friends.  Before I forget, a special shout out to Kesavan.",

I met Dr. Syed, Dr. Prashanth, Dr. Bharath  & Dr. Andrew (in the order) during the procedures.  It started with extraction, four root canals, cap prep, two bridges and a cap on my molar.  I finally got done last week after almost two months of all procedures (step-by-step). These guys may look young but let me tell you, they are **** ************* *** experienced. With my health condition, Dr. Prashanth was able to set  up my appointments accordingly.  All of them were courteous and Dr. Prashanth is expert in it :). Hands down, these guys are the  experts.  They know what they're doing and they do it correct .I would definitely recommend them to my family/friends.  Before I forget, a special shout out to Kesavan.",
