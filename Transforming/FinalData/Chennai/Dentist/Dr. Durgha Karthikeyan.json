What I liked most about Maxx dental was the professionalism - be it timeliness in appointments, follow-up or clarity in communicating the problem and possible solution options. The doctors and staff are friendly and courteous, and the procedures are done by numerous experts in the field, some in-house and others brought in as needed. They come across as a premium service provider, and are easily available on call for any doubts/clarifications in between appointments/sittings. Overall... a very good experience. My parents, wife and brother's family have also got treatments done here at Maxx Dental and are happy with the experience.",

I had quite a big open bite. It was opined that I might have a tooth or two removed and serious still, that only surgery might help my cause. It was then Dr. Nivetha of Radiant Dental at Perungudi introduced me to Dr. Durgha. Dr. Durgha was not only clear that they were uncalled for but also firmly knew what needs to be done precisely. Over the course, she let me understand each set of processes and what the desired effect of it would be. By realising what the doctor is trying to do, you are encouraged to follow her instructions diligently. So I was eager to see the progress in each visit. She anticipates results, favourable or otherwise, has alternatives too and thus directs accordingly- a modus operandi any professional would love to bear. By the virtue of all these, Dr. Durgha has a part in my 'aesthetic' smile now. Thank you, doctor.\n\nP. S: Radiant is a definite go too. Other doctors and sisters are thoroughly equipped as well. Thanks to a very amicable team",

I had quite a big open bite. It was opined that I might have a tooth or two removed and serious still, that only surgery might help my cause. It was then Dr. Nivetha of Radiant Dental at Perungudi introduced me to Dr. Durgha. Dr. Durgha was not only clear that they were uncalled for but also firmly knew what needs to be done precisely. Over the course, she let me understand each set of processes and what the desired effect of it would be. By realising what the doctor is trying to do, you are encouraged to follow her instructions diligently. So I was eager to see the progress in each visit. She anticipates results, favourable or otherwise, has alternatives too and thus directs accordingly- a modus operandi any professional would love to bear. By the virtue of all these, Dr. Durgha has a part in my 'aesthetic' smile now. Thank you, doctor.\n\nP. S: Radiant is a definite go too. Other doctors and sisters are thoroughly equipped as well. Thanks to a very amicable team",

I can't even eat at that time and literally that was my situation.I have seen many doctors and many doctors said that you should make a surgery and can't correct it. But the durgha doctor gave me hope and she proved it. I had no pain throughout the treatment.Now I feel very happy because my crossbiting has been corrected and I can eat normally. I have 100% satisfaction with my teeth now. My heartfelt Thanks to durgha doctor.",

I am about 36 years old and I took it this treatment as I faced incomplete biting and chewing issues and there was also a distinct possibility of losing my lower teeth. I must admit that, if it was not for the persistence and hard work of the doctor, I would not have completed the treatment.  I would like to thank her by saying few words on the treatment she provided to me. She had always kept my best interest in mind and she provided the best possible treatment to me, even going out of her way.  She had always provided appointments to me even during pandemic times, some of the times she had to travel to clinic only to attend me as I was visiting her from outstation. I had paid my entire fees during the first three months of the treatment, when I wanted to prematurely discontinue the treatment due to repeated breakages in wire, she could have simply acceded without any financial impact, however she continued to treat me with great care for over an year and half to successfully treat me. I am thankful to her and I wish her a long and illustrious career.",

After the very first appointment I was confident that my daughter is in the right hands for her treatment. Dr Durgha patiently took us through the options available and what will best work for my daughter. As a parent I was happy in making informed decisions on the choice I was taking. \nDr Durgha\u2019s consistency for perfection was witnessed through this period as I could see that she was not willing to compromise until the desired results were achieved. Yesterday when the braces was off; I witnessed how beautifully she has structured my daughters teeth alignment in less than 11 months \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42..\nDr Durgha hats off ,my daughter owes this beautiful smile to you.. Thank you for the awesome support during her treatment.",
