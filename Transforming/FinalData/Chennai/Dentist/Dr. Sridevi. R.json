She follows the ethics and principles from UK.\n\nShe also suggests many natural remedies  and healthy practices rather than giving us a huge list of medicines to purchase.

Since I am in Chennai I have visited the dental hospitals here and twice the the crown fixation again came off.  Finally when I visited Dr.Sridevi of The Shree's clinic she has taken the extra effort to understand the root cause of the fall and also coordinated with Dr.Gowd as to the nature of implant and ensured that the re-fixation of the crown was very successful.  Till date no further issues to my teeth after this re-fixation.",
