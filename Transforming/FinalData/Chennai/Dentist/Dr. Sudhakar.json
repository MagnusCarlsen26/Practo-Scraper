This was my first dental visit. I was a bit excited and nervous on how it would go. \nAfter reaching, he told me that he was going to put a spray that will make my lips, tongue and gum numb and dry.\nThe spray was bitter and kind of spicy and it was very tough to hold it in my mouth. Then after a couple of minutes, he told me to spit it out. After that, he gave an injection of anesthesia and then my whole mouth was dry and numb. While pulling my tooth out, he was distracting me by talking so that I feel calm and not nervous. After he took the tooth, he showed it to me and then only I realized that he had taken it out because I didn\u2019t feel a thing!\nhe told me to have ice-cream after I go home and to not have hot things. I was very happy because I could have ice-cream!!\n** ** *** **** **** ******* ** *** ***** *** I recommend \u2018Gift A Smile\u2019 near Amir Mahal to everyone who reads this and has dental problems! \n",

Then treatment is done with high steriled equipments. They even have sleep therapy treatment which puts patient into sleep while the treatment goes on patient will not know anything the surgery is done safely as they sleep. The charges are very Nominal... And they give a very good follow up calls too... I can strongly recommend Dr.Sudhakar's Gift smile dental clinic for any age category patients. Great work Dr.Sudhakar and Team.",

This was my first dental visit. I was a bit excited and nervous on how it would go. \nAfter reaching, he told me that he was going to put a spray that will make my lips, tongue and gum numb and dry.\nThe spray was bitter and kind of spicy and it was very tough to hold it in my mouth. Then after a couple of minutes, he told me to spit it out. After that, he gave an injection of anesthesia and then my whole mouth was dry and numb. While pulling my tooth out, he was distracting me by talking so that I feel calm and not nervous. After he took the tooth, he showed it to me and then only I realized that he had taken it out because I didn\u2019t feel a thing!\nhe told me to have ice-cream after I go home and to not have hot things. I was very happy because I could have ice-cream!!\n** ** *** **** **** ******* ** *** ***** *** I recommend \u2018Gift A Smile\u2019 near Amir Mahal to everyone who reads this and has dental problems! \n",
