************** Responsible. Deft. Brilliant.
You run for adjectives when you're a more than happy, content patient. I had quite a big open bite. It was opined that I might have a tooth or two removed and serious still, that only surgery might help my cause. It was then Dr. Nivetha of Radiant Dental at Perungudi introduced me to Dr. Durgha. Dr. Durgha was not only clear that they were uncalled for but also firmly knew what needs to be done precisely. Over the course, she let me understand each set of processes and what the desired effect of it would be. By realising what the doctor is trying to do, you are encouraged to follow her instructions diligently. So I was eager to see the progress in each visit. She anticipates results, favourable or otherwise, has alternatives too and thus directs accordingly- a modus operandi any professional would love to bear.
