Chakravarthy is seriously the master of the game. His work is pure precision. If you want a hassle free and best treatment then just blindfold your eyes and rest yourself at ' My Dental Specialist', everything else will be taken care of by them. Have any doubt's and you will be answered wisely. Afraid of pain? Don't worry, I just felt a negligible needle prick in the whole treatment of 6 months. I seriously did not even feel a thing after root canal.! Which sounded so big to me coz of what people said earlier to me. They are having all the latest technologies equipped with them to give you a flawless treatment and results. If you go to them once you will never feel like going anywhere else in the futu*** ** *** *** ******** **** **** *** **** *** **** ** ***** \n\nYour smiling patient\nAbhinav Sharma",

That is when Dr Chakravarthy showed me photos of other cases he had corrected. It was like a dream. I straight away fixed an appointment. After he was done and I saw my teeth in the mirror I could not believe that my teeth were looking like this. One sitting.  One evening. That's it. New smile, new confidence. A new me.

But my first injection given by him was totally painless. I got my tooth removed with no pain. He said I could travel next morning itself.  Very happy that I came to My Dental Specialist. Will come again for further treatments.",

I had initially just come for an opinion, as a couple of other dentists I went to, said that I would need a surgery as well, apart from braces, and I wasnt keen on getting a surgery.The Orthodontist here, clarified all my doubts and explained to me clearly as to what my condition is like and why I wouldn't require a surgery. So, that was a huge plus for me, as I was mentally relieved, that I don't need to go through any such hassle. Secondly, Dr.Chakravarthy, also ensured that he would be taking care of my oral hygiene requirements as well, during the course of my treatment, and explained to me how important it is. So, I got treatments such as air polishing, fluoride application and some restorations done before the start of my treatment. I opted for ceramic braces. Its just been a month now, and I am happy with it! :) ",

Have any doubt's and you will be answered wisely. Afraid of pain? Don't worry, I just felt a negligible needle prick in the whole treatment of 6 months. I seriously did not even feel a thing after root canal.! Which sounded so big to me coz of what people said earlier to me. They are having all the latest technologies equipped with them to give you a flawless treatment and results.

I had initially just come for an opinion, as a couple of other dentists I went to, said that I would need a surgery as well, apart from braces, and I wasnt keen on getting a surgery.The Orthodontist here, clarified all my doubts and explained to me clearly as to what my condition is like and why I wouldn't require a surgery. So, that was a huge plus for me, as I was mentally relieved, that I don't need to go through any such hassle. Secondly, Dr.Chakravarthy, also ensured that he would be taking care of my oral hygiene requirements as well, during the course of my treatment, and explained to me how important it is. So, I got treatments such as air polishing, fluoride application and some restorations done before the start of my treatment. I opted for ceramic braces. Its just been a month now, and I am happy with it! :) ",
