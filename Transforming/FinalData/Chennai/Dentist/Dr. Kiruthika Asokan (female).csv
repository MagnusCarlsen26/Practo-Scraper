The permanent treatment is to do root canal and fix tooth cap. I was frightened but she clearly explained about both the procedure. She asked me to take temporary treatment first if it does not ease the pain then we can go for the permanent treatment. I opted for the root canal treatment. It was less painful and the cost was also  reasonable when  compared to other clinics. I am really happy with her treatment. She gave the exact match of tooth cap for my treated tooth.

Since root canal treatment is a long process, we fixed an appointment for you at 5:30PM and for another patient at 6:00 PM. But, you reached our clinic only at 6:15PM. So we had to finish the consultation of the second patient, who arrived punctually at her fixed appointment time. We had to finish up with the treatment of the second patient before starting your treatment. We hope this doesn't happen again and we kindly request you to be punctual with respect to fixed appointments.All our appointments got delay for 45 mts and our clinic closing time too extended. üòä
