I felt no pain during the process and the instructions given post surgery helped me recover and be at ease. Made two visits to clinic after surgery. Post surgery follow up and care at this clinic and by the Dr is great. \n\nStaff is very friendly and the clinic is clean. Will recommend Shruthy and True Dental Care to people I know. Especially ones who are scared to go to a dentist. Planning to take my mom next and have personal checkups here from now.",

Xray was advised and surgery was planned and explained to me very clearly and was done two days later. \n\nAfter a year or so of being afraid to get my decaying wisdom teeth removed, was finally able to get it done. I felt no pain during the process and the instructions given post surgery helped me recover and be at ease. Made two visits to clinic after surgery. Post surgery follow up and care at this clinic and by the Dr is great. \n\nStaff is very friendly and the clinic is clean. Will recommend Shruthy and True Dental Care to people I know. Especially ones who are scared to go to a dentist. Planning to take my mom next and have personal checkups here from now.",

So my wife used Practo to find me a good Dentist and she suggested Dr.Shruthy.\n\nMy first appointment was smooth and Doctor explained clearly what needs to be done and recommended for the wisdom tooth removal as it was giving me lot of pain.\n\nNever in my lifetime I had to go thru tooth extraction and I was very afraid of the procedure but Doctor Shruthy gave me the right confidence for the procedure and I ended up taking not one but two teeth\u2019s :-) To be honest I had zero pain during the whole procedure and I am so grateful to my doctor. \n\nI will 200% recommend Dr.Shruthy to anyone and would surely consult with her for any of my future treatments for myself and to my whole family \u263a\ufe0f",
