Her patience and understanding were truly commendable. \n\nThe procedure itself was handled with the utmost care and expertise that was very much needed for my 3 year old daughter. Dr. Janvi took the time to explain each step to my daughter in a way that she could understand, which alleviated any fears she had. Dr. Janvi along with dental assistants , Ms. Janki and Ms. Soundrya worked seamlessly to ensure that the appointment went smoothly.\n\nOverall, our visit was a positive one, thanks to the friendly environment, the professionalism , and the exceptional care provided by Dr. Janvi .",
