He doesn't like visits to hospitals at the best of times and I had quite a struggle convincing him to see Dr. Mareeswari. I had read good reviews about her practice and booked an appointment  through her receptionist. It has to be said at this point that the appointments were always bang on time, never late. Dr. Mareeswari was very friendly and caring and put my difficult to please father- in-law at ease, the moment we met her . My father-in-law had to undergo a root canal treatment and then had to have caps fitted over his teeth. She patiently explained each and every step of the process to be undergone . She took great pains to alleviate  my father-in-law's doubts and anxiety. We are very happy with her and would definitely recommend her because she really cares about her patients and is extremely professional. We also liked the follow-up calls to know how the patient was doing.",

I am very thankful to Dr.Mareeswari who was so prompt in finding out what was my problem when she saw the scanning report and x-ray.She answered all my questions with so much of patience and always had a smily face. Dr.Mareeswari and the entire team were kind and the whole clinic had a positive vibe. I travelled 1hr from my location but it is a total worth. Price is reasonable. I strongly recommend this clinic.

I filled around  7 teeth and I'm extremely happy with the treatment and feel more confidence  looking at my teeth now. The clinic is well maintained with great hygiene and cost is optimal.

It should be really a hard time to make them understand for what reason they are meeting a doctor. For sure at this age being panic is the first expression we see in their face. But with Dr Mareeswari, this is entirely a new story. She welcomed and greeted my child with her smiling face, that erased the panic. She started speaking with my kid with no bothering of time. She conveyed in a friendly manner,the available types of treatment for kids with pros and corns. \nIt will be a great task for us to see her decayed tooth in home, but Dr asked her to show the decayed tooth. We where surprised, she responded immediately with no fear. This showed her kindness and her expirence in handling a kid. I strongly recommend DR Mareeswari for Kids. For sure once you visit the clinic you will get a very good expirence and the real value for your hard earned money. ",

She examined and suggested a scan for knowing the root reason for the pain. With the scan report it was clear that my tooth has decayed deep into my roots which was the cause for the jaw ache. Doc suggested root canal in order to save the tooth. I was little nervous. But doc explained the root canal process with the help of a animated video and me understand the process is not that complex . In the next sitting root canal was done and further to it crown was fixed. All the treatment was very much smooth without any complication. Doc is very friendly *** ***** ********* ******** *** **** * *** ***** *********. I would strongly recommend Ms Mareeswari for your dental problems. ",

He doesn't like visits to hospitals at the best of times and I had quite a struggle convincing him to see Dr. Mareeswari. I had read good reviews about her practice and booked an appointment  through her receptionist. It has to be said at this point that the appointments were always bang on time, never late. Dr. Mareeswari was very friendly and caring and put my difficult to please father- in-law at ease, the moment we met her . My father-in-law had to undergo a root canal treatment and then had to have caps fitted over his teeth. She patiently explained each and every step of the process to be undergone . She took great pains to alleviate  my father-in-law's doubts and anxiety. We are very happy with her and would definitely recommend her because she really cares about her patients and is extremely professional. We also liked the follow-up calls to know how the patient was doing.",

I was scared about the pain, but tooth was removed without any pain even the injection given for numbness was like an ant bite. It was awesome. The procedure was simple and doctors are well experienced. I am very thankful to Dr.Mareeswari who was so prompt in finding out what was my problem when she saw the scanning report and x-ray.She answered all my questions with so much of patience and always had a smily face. Dr.Mareeswari and the entire team were kind and the whole clinic had a positive vibe. I travelled 1hr from my location but it is a total worth. Price is reasonable. I strongly recommend this clinic. Happy smile \ud83d\ude2c",

Throughout the treatment process she kept me informed about  what is going on and ensured I was never in any pain. I filled around  7 teeth and I'm extremely happy with the treatment and feel more confidence  looking at my teeth now. The clinic is well maintained with great hygiene and cost is optimal. I would highly recommend for everyone if you are looking for a dental clinic with great service  from a **** doctor with an optimal cost.",

It should be really a hard time to make them understand for what reason they are meeting a doctor. For sure at this age being panic is the first expression we see in their face. But with Dr Mareeswari, this is entirely a new story. She welcomed and greeted my child with her smiling face, that erased the panic. She started speaking with my kid with no bothering of time. She conveyed in a friendly manner,the available types of treatment for kids with pros and corns. \nIt will be a great task for us to see her decayed tooth in home, but Dr asked her to show the decayed tooth. We where surprised, she responded immediately with no fear. This showed her kindness and her expirence in handling a kid. I strongly recommend DR Mareeswari for Kids. For sure once you visit the clinic you will get a very good expirence and the real value for your hard earned money. ",

During the treatment there is no pain and the treatment is worth the cost which is very low compared to others. Very professional and calm in handling patients. The hospital environment is good and there is no wait time. After the treatment, they will take an Xray and show the RCT done in tooth. If you are new to chennai or in need of a good dentist, I strongly suggest to visit this Dental clinic *** **** **********",

She examined and suggested a scan for knowing the root reason for the pain. With the scan report it was clear that my tooth has decayed deep into my roots which was the cause for the jaw ache. Doc suggested root canal in order to save the tooth. I was little nervous. But doc explained the root canal process with the help of a animated video and me understand the process is not that complex . In the next sitting root canal was done and further to it crown was fixed. All the treatment was very much smooth without any complication. Doc is very friendly *** ***** ********* ******** *** **** * *** ***** *********. I would strongly recommend Ms Mareeswari for your dental problems. ",

Generally some old gentlemens are tougher as they would be quite adament because they too are like kids only.. Mareeshwari handled and explained the complications very patiently and her treatment style was pretty cool and painless seeing which my father too stunned.

I visited the clinic because I had to get Root canal treatment done for three of my teeth. I was under the impression that root canal Treatments take atleast 3 sittings to finish, but Dr. Mareeswari completed my Root Canal treatment in one visit itself! She was amazing and she saved me a lot of time. I am a working mother and I don't get a lot of time to go to the dentist. She gave me an appointment according to my convenience and I really liked that. Thank You, Dr. Mareeswari and your staff for all you do! . Highly recommended as doctor is very interactive too and keeps the atmosphere quite comfortable. I will definitely only go to her whenever I have and dental problems in the future.",
