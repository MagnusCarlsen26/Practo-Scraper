Me and my wife were little worried as this is my first visit to a Dentist for my kid and it was a wonderful experience to say the least.\n\nThe Doctor is super cool and took a lot of time to explain the nuances of the issue, preventive measures to be taken both for the kid and parents and listed out the alternative modes of treatment.\n\nWe really enjoyed the session at the clinic and my kid was happily interacting with the doctor. Been a long long time to have such an experience with Doctors.",
