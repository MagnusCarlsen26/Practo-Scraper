She has been so kind, patient and friendly with my teenage daughter who was initially not at all willing to go for braces to correct some crookedness. That was one year back. Right from choosing the brace type to treatment pace to choosing the retainers now, the doctor explained all the options and let it to my daughter to decide. In about a year, the teeth are all straightened out and we will move to retainers from this month. I thank her for being so patient, ever smiling, and chilled out. Takes the stress out of parents and definitely I will not consider any other dentist anymore!",

She doesn\u2019t time box a treatment which is  usually done at corporate dental care. She slows down the process if patient finds it sensitive and doesn\u2019t mind if the treatment time gets extended. \nHer impeccable attention to detail and fore-bearing  nature ensures the treatment addresses the cause and at the same provides an almost pain free experience to the patient. In my opinion her dental care is one of the best  offered in and around Chennai. \n",

I had visited the doctor for a second review of my previous dental treatment (invisible aligners) which was incomplete. She was able to address all my concerns and provide feasible, efficient solutions. I am currently undergoing treatment under Dr. Anusha who is helping me recover the mishaps of my previous treatment and complete my cosmetic dentistry concerns. From a patients perspective I would high recommend Dr.Anusha.",

The place was very clean and the doctor was very good. She first made me very comfortable knowing that I was scared and assured me it would be a very smooth procedure. And it was. Absolutely smooth. She explained in detail about post care and they also followed up to check how I was doing. Very happy with the overall experience. ",

In about a year, the teeth are all straightened out and we will move to retainers from this month. I thank her for being so patient, ever smiling, and chilled out.

She is one of those doctors who patiently listens and also explains the \u201cWhat\u201d and \u201cWhy\u201d of the issue, the solution in layman terms. \nShe does not force any of the dental procedures on the patient, rather provides enough details about the issue, the procedure options (including wait and watch) and it\u2019s outcome there by allowing the patient to understand and decide the best course of action. \nHer procedures, especially dental fillings are done with patient\u2019s sensitivity in mind. She doesn\u2019t time box a treatment which is  usually done at corporate dental care. She slows down the process if patient finds it sensitive and doesn\u2019t mind if the treatment time gets extended. \nHer impeccable attention to detail and fore-bearing  nature ensures the treatment addresses the cause and at the same provides an almost pain free experience to the patient. In my opinion her dental care is one of the best  offered in and around Chennai. \n",

The place was very clean and the doctor was very good. She first made me very comfortable knowing that I was scared and assured me it would be a very smooth procedure. And it was. Absolutely smooth. She explained in detail about post care and they also followed up to check how I was doing. Very happy with the overall experience. ",
