Since 4 yrs i had dental problem and I had been visiting various doctors , the doctors sought out root canal as my solution and I have treated my 4 teeth with root canal but i had underwent pain even after root canal. only here i found out my wisdom teeth needed to be removed for my permanent pain loss. i am glad my brother suggested me to this doctor. so much kindness , attention and patience of the doctors here is admirable. their precise explanation of my issue and perfect treatment is something I am really thankful for. i had my 4 wisdom teeth removed within half an hour when I didn't feel  single pain and didn't know that my teeth were removed. there are plenty of doctors available but Dr. Sivaraman and Dr. Rajeshwari are those who work to relieve and cure problems . they are few of the gifted doctors one can have their treatment resolved with .",
