It was almost manageable since my age is just 22 my body started recovering with a day or two. It took 8 days to heal on one side completely.\n\nI had constant support from him through call even at night remainding me to take my medications to keeping ice packs. \n\nWe planned it at 9Pm at night and it took 20 mins for both upper and lower wisdom teeths. Honestly to tell it was painless for both the sides and his method of using professional technique of teeth removal did not even give me a noticeable swelling anyway which is gone in 4 days.\n\nOther side it was horizontal impact in left lower wisdom teeth and upper tooth took more than the right side to 35mins. Its been just 2 days I am recovering from it and Im happy all four came out without causing troubles.\nThat my story short. Thank you very much Doctor Udhay",

I was really satisfied with his way of explanation & treatment plan,.. he has done a deep scaling and root planing & polishing, followed with medication. Now am feeling better after the treatment. Even during Corona period he has done everything in a proper manner by following proper sanitising ,temperature checking, pulse oxymeter ,no apparets, even I can check my weight also. He is having & following all these medical essential things, I will definitely refer Dr.Udhaya to my friends and colleagues to get a best treatment.",
