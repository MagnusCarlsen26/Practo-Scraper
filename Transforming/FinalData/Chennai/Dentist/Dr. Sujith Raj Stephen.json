It has become losse and shaking for past 2 months so I visited Dr. Steve's clinic, they suggest me to go for fixed implant teeth, it was bit scary because placing  screw inside the bone was not that easy for me to take up, so I gone through many article regarding the treatment and finally I made up mind to go for the treatment,, doctor hv placed 4 implants in upper jaw and gave a full set of fixed teeth with in 10 days,, the entire procedure of placing implant ws less than 45 mins, completely painless during the procedure, mild swelling nd pain was there for next 3 days but it was quite tolerable. Thanks to doctor and assisting doctor for taking care of me throughout the procedure, now I can enjoy all my food with a natural feeling nd my self confidence have increased a lot. Total treatment is value for money what I have spend. Thanks to doctor and team again. ",
