I am not sure of their names, but 3 Dr.\u2019s visited and I got treatment from them during my course for the past 2 years since it was a long journey. Saturday was my regular monthly appointment. All are comfortable to me. Although Ortho Dr's is on a move, Harsini dental clinic holds the bond to care for and satisfy the patients.\nI need to be honest like, I never keep up my timings, sometimes I skipped/ I would be available at the station. Even though I would get reminder calls from the Clinic. One day the Dr. Waited for me till 10:30 pm since I need to travel the very next day.\nThank you so much Dr. I am amazed to see the transformation of my teeth. I am much more confident than before.\nThe alignment of my teeth and the front profile were totally changed and gave a new looks to my face with a smile.\nI strongly recommend my Friends and Colleagues. Keep up your good work.\nthanks",

                "review_text": "\nMy 3Yrs of experience with the Braces & the Clinic\n\nClose to 1 yr was standstill during corona plus 3-4 months were passed on consultations with diff. orthodontist & also there were transitions in Dr.'s before & after corona. Orthodontist are the one who specialises in the diagnosis, prevention & correction of teeth, jaws in our case it's concerned with the braces. Here the orthodontist is arranged and he visits the clinic once a month. ** ************ *** * ******** **** My advice is to find an clinic(For Braces)where the Dr. is specialised in orthodontics, *** ******* ***** ** *** ****** ***** it's time taking procedure some may end up removing the braces in years time while some may be even take years together depending upon the complexity, if one finds the clinic with the Dr. specialised in it, everyone can have their customised schedule, can visit Dr. anyday rather in an day of strict schedule & interval of. visits and duration of the process would be short, some orthodontics follow shorter intervals b/w visits. Also in case of uneven circumstances of breakage in between it could be easy to fix, while in here if any mishap happens you should suppose the contact the clinic, the clinic consults with the specialist obtains it's approval, and would plan as per the convenience of both, it's cumbersome & Expensive. The appointments were initimated to patients on close call there would be a call days before of the appointment and that's it, you're supposed to remind of the date & time and plan with the schedule , initially even this system was poorly managed, adapting to their schedule was quite a challenge, in the last 6-8 months the clinic's integration with the Practo, uplifted the clinic .practo reminds patients of the appointments regularly, after the clinic updates their status with practo, after consultant(orthodontist) opinions are sought out. Practo did an splendid job . The prices have soared in these 3Yrs. drastically and I find it quite high for their service.\n\nThe package cost was fixed initially, whilst 50% were paid initially and rest through installments of 10% in every months visit. I requested the Dr. for the bill but it was prolonged till the last day. Everytime I would ask for the bill, there would be an excuse from the Dr. it was initially I have asked for the bill after the 1st installment i.e after 60% , bcos. it's hard to keep track of the installments during corona has there were long intervals in between, an acknowledgment would suffice but this isn't honored the Dr. said the bill will be given only after the complete payment of installments . So, I patiently traveled with the course and asked for the bill after the completion of payment & now I was said that the bill would be given after the completion of procedure. And so it was on the last day I was given the bill. It's everyone right to ask for the bill & should be honored. The clinic also didn't keep up with the time for some(4-5) visits the waiting period was so long, 30 mins to 1.5Hrs.\n\nInitial days were glorious days with the clinic but it doesn't last long. I regret for choosing this clinic. Hope my experience would lend way for the beginners.",

She had a initial look on my teeth decay based on that she said there are two things , first one would be normal removal of teeth decay and second would be root canal. Again these options depend on how deeply impacted. After removing the teeth decay she said that it impacted little deeply and removed everything. Finally went for filling.. charged only 500 rs. Note: I didnot opted for laser filling. She just took around 45 minutes to complete all the process. Really i bothered how long this process will take. But within 45 minutes she had done a great job. Overall I am happy with her performance for tooth decay.  The people who are looking for dental clinic please visit there. ",

I am not sure of their names, but 3 Dr.\u2019s visited and I got treatment from them during my course for the past 2 years since it was a long journey. Saturday was my regular monthly appointment. All are comfortable to me. Although Ortho Dr's is on a move, Harsini dental clinic holds the bond to care for and satisfy the patients.\nI need to be honest like, I never keep up my timings, sometimes I skipped/ I would be available at the station. Even though I would get reminder calls from the Clinic. One day the Dr. Waited for me till 10:30 pm since I need to travel the very next day.\nThank you so much Dr. I am amazed to see the transformation of my teeth. I am much more confident than before.\nThe alignment of my teeth and the front profile were totally changed and gave a new looks to my face with a smile.\nI strongly recommend my Friends and Colleagues. Keep up your good work.\nthanks",

Orthodontist are the one who specialises in the diagnosis, prevention & correction of teeth, jaws in our case it's concerned with the braces. Here the orthodontist is arranged and he visits the clinic once a month. ** ************ *** * ******** **** My advice is to find an clinic(For Braces)where the Dr. is specialised in orthodontics, *** ******* ***** ** *** ****** ***** it's time taking procedure some may end up removing the braces in years time while some may be even take years together depending upon the complexity, if one finds the clinic with the Dr. specialised in it, everyone can have their customised schedule, can visit Dr. anyday rather in an day of strict schedule & interval of. visits and duration of the process would be short, some orthodontics follow shorter intervals b/w visits. Also in case of uneven circumstances of breakage in between it could be easy to fix, while in here if any mishap happens you should suppose the contact the clinic, the clinic consults with the specialist obtains it's approval, and would plan as per the convenience of both, it's cumbersome & Expensive. The appointments were initimated to patients on close call there would be a call days before of the appointment and that's it, you're supposed to remind of the date & time and plan with the schedule , initially even this system was poorly managed, adapting to their schedule was quite a challenge, in the last 6-8 months the clinic's integration with the Practo, uplifted the clinic .practo reminds patients of the appointments regularly, after the clinic updates their status with practo, after consultant(orthodontist) opinions are sought out. Practo did an splendid job . The prices have soared in these 3Yrs. drastically and I find it quite high for their service.\n\nThe package cost was fixed initially, whilst 50% were paid initially and rest through installments of 10% in every months visit. I requested the Dr. for the bill but it was prolonged till the last day. Everytime I would ask for the bill, there would be an excuse from the Dr. it was initially I have asked for the bill after the 1st installment i.e after 60% , bcos. it's hard to keep track of the installments during corona has there were long intervals in between, an acknowledgment would suffice but this isn't honored the Dr. said the bill will be given only after the complete payment of installments . So, I patiently traveled with the course and asked for the bill after the completion of payment & now I was said that the bill would be given after the completion of procedure. And so it was on the last day I was given the bill. It's everyone right to ask for the bill & should be honored. The clinic also didn't keep up with the time for some(4-5) visits the waiting period was so long, 30 mins to 1.5Hrs.\n\nInitial days were glorious days with the clinic but it doesn't last long. I regret for choosing this clinic. Hope my experience would lend way for the beginners.",

She had a initial look on my teeth decay based on that she said there are two things , first one would be normal removal of teeth decay and second would be root canal. Again these options depend on how deeply impacted. After removing the teeth decay she said that it impacted little deeply and removed everything. Finally went for filling.. charged only 500 rs. Note: I didnot opted for laser filling. She just took around 45 minutes to complete all the process. Really i bothered how long this process will take. But within 45 minutes she had done a great job. Overall I am happy with her performance for tooth decay.  The people who are looking for dental clinic please visit there. ",
