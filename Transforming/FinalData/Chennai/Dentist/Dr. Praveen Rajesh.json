Not expensive)\nCar Parking: Available(Check once before you book an appointment)\nAppointment: 5/5 \nDuration of Treatment: 4.5/5 ****** **** ******** *******\nPain-level during and after treatment: 4.5/5 (Trust me, my tolerance levels are low)\nMusic During treatment: Self DJ :p\n\nIt was during the lock down I had visited the clinic. I'm sure Dr. Kritika would vouch for the situation in which I had come. Though they were handling another patient, Dr. Praveen quickly helped in arresting the shooting pain first so that he could finish with the other patient in the meantime. \n\nOnce it was my turn, Praveen attended my case. \n\nFirstly, I had visited because of a shooting pain in the decayed teeth which I was prolonging the pain using the usual pain killers. Once it was time I couldn't prolong it anymore, I decided that i'll see a dentist. \n\nPraveen carefully examined my case and using his gizmos showed on the bigger screen the condition of my teeth. (P.S. He is also a dental photographer so ask for nice pics of your teeth later). He identified that I needed two RCTs and some filling for the slightly decayed teeth. \n\nThe treatment was a step by step procedure which got done in 3 sittings and 1 sitting for the caps. Again, 3 sittings is because i had a huge amount of puss which had to subside so that he could continue with the RCT. \n\nPost RCT, the caps were put on and had to come another day to check on the positioning of the caps. \n\nI still have my fillings, one extraction and two implants to be done yet.. so will write about that in the next review. \n\nAlso, they maintain all your records on the cloud, so in case you are else where and you need your reports/records, they would be glad to share it with you/the dentist. \n\nDr. Praveen: Chilled out doc. Charming personality. (P.S.: Sorry girls, he is taken) Patiently explains the procedure. Shows the pictures and videos of the treatment (Pre&Post). Doesn't beat around the bush but is straight out in telling you what is the best. More than timely resolution which most of the dentists do, Praveen is more of a preventive care specialist. He not only sorts out the issue but also focuses more on the preventive part so that you don't have to come back again with a bigger problem. \n\nDr. Kritika: Super cool doctor. Though she didn't attend my case (She is a Pediatric Dentist), she was there throughout. It was super fun. \n\nIt was actually super fun. It was more like I came there to hang out with two of my friends and it was all laughter and enjoyment throughout. ",

This visit was for me where I had severe gum problems with pain and bleeding. \n\nDr.Praveen Rajesh listened to my problem very calmly and examined my tooth and explained that it is due to Hard plaque formation on the gums, he clearly explained what treatment he is going to do. I was very scared to visit a dentist and kept postponed many years because the pain which I underwent during my childhood days is unforgettable. Dr.Praveen understood my fear and suggested a Nitrous oxide sedation method which made me more comfortable so that we don\u2019t get anxious.\n\nDr.Swarna did the procedure and no pain was experienced during the entire procedure. I got my teeth back as to how it was before. She is a brilliant dentist, with utmost compassion towards the comfort of me.\n\nShe also explained the brushing techniques and showed the before and after treatment photos which makes it very clear for me to understand and witness the results. She is just brilliant and a master of her trade and I highly recommend her.\n\nThe clinic is very neat and well maintained. Appointments well in time and completed the procedure on time. Highly professional with great expertise. \n\nThank you Microsmiles for giving me back my SMILE.",

I was totally convinced and agreed for the treatment, as suggested by him.. he filled three teeth in such a short duration, totally painless.. Also cleaned my teeth with his advanced new tool, which was quick and no pain. I was surprised that he completed my entire treatment within an hour, which otherwise would have taken minimum three sittings in my earlier dental clinics..\nWith the melodious music in the background and comfortable sky view chair, it was an enjoyable experience than treatment., Rather I would say it is like a dental spa.. I recommend Doctor Praveen for all age groups who are in need of painless and apt treatment for their dental problems in a very comfortable and wonderful ambience in less time",

Not expensive)\nCar Parking: Available(Check once before you book an appointment)\nAppointment: 5/5 \nDuration of Treatment: 4.5/5 ****** **** ******** *******\nPain-level during and after treatment: 4.5/5 (Trust me, my tolerance levels are low)\nMusic During treatment: Self DJ :p\n\nIt was during the lock down I had visited the clinic. I'm sure Dr. Kritika would vouch for the situation in which I had come. Though they were handling another patient, Dr. Praveen quickly helped in arresting the shooting pain first so that he could finish with the other patient in the meantime. \n\nOnce it was my turn, Praveen attended my case. \n\nFirstly, I had visited because of a shooting pain in the decayed teeth which I was prolonging the pain using the usual pain killers. Once it was time I couldn't prolong it anymore, I decided that i'll see a dentist. \n\nPraveen carefully examined my case and using his gizmos showed on the bigger screen the condition of my teeth. (P.S. He is also a dental photographer so ask for nice pics of your teeth later). He identified that I needed two RCTs and some filling for the slightly decayed teeth. \n\nThe treatment was a step by step procedure which got done in 3 sittings and 1 sitting for the caps. Again, 3 sittings is because i had a huge amount of puss which had to subside so that he could continue with the RCT. \n\nPost RCT, the caps were put on and had to come another day to check on the positioning of the caps. \n\nI still have my fillings, one extraction and two implants to be done yet.. so will write about that in the next review. \n\nAlso, they maintain all your records on the cloud, so in case you are else where and you need your reports/records, they would be glad to share it with you/the dentist. \n\nDr. Praveen: Chilled out doc. Charming personality. (P.S.: Sorry girls, he is taken) Patiently explains the procedure. Shows the pictures and videos of the treatment (Pre&Post). Doesn't beat around the bush but is straight out in telling you what is the best. More than timely resolution which most of the dentists do, Praveen is more of a preventive care specialist. He not only sorts out the issue but also focuses more on the preventive part so that you don't have to come back again with a bigger problem. \n\nDr. Kritika: Super cool doctor. Though she didn't attend my case (She is a Pediatric Dentist), she was there throughout. It was super fun. \n\nIt was actually super fun. It was more like I came there to hang out with two of my friends and it was all laughter and enjoyment throughout. ",

This visit was for me where I had severe gum problems with pain and bleeding. \n\nDr.Praveen Rajesh listened to my problem very calmly and examined my tooth and explained that it is due to Hard plaque formation on the gums, he clearly explained what treatment he is going to do. I was very scared to visit a dentist and kept postponed many years because the pain which I underwent during my childhood days is unforgettable. Dr.Praveen understood my fear and suggested a Nitrous oxide sedation method which made me more comfortable so that we don\u2019t get anxious.\n\nDr.Swarna did the procedure and no pain was experienced during the entire procedure. I got my teeth back as to how it was before. She is a brilliant dentist, with utmost compassion towards the comfort of me.\n\nShe also explained the brushing techniques and showed the before and after treatment photos which makes it very clear for me to understand and witness the results. She is just brilliant and a master of her trade and I highly recommend her.\n\nThe clinic is very neat and well maintained. Appointments well in time and completed the procedure on time. Highly professional with great expertise. \n\nThank you Microsmiles for giving me back my SMILE.",

In Two teeth filling had come out and also had sensitivity in many tooth..\nDr.Praveen gave me confidence that he can provide me treatment with minimum pain..I was totally impressed by the ambience and the moment sat in the dental chair, I felt  very comfortable. \nAfter careful examination of my teeth & quick X-Ray , Dr. Praveen explained me in a very simple way about the problems in my teeth and his treatment plan.. I was totally convinced and agreed for the treatment, as suggested by him.. he filled three teeth in such a short duration, totally painless.. Also cleaned my teeth with his advanced new tool, which was quick and no pain. I was surprised that he completed my entire treatment within an hour, which otherwise would have taken minimum three sittings in my earlier dental clinics..\nWith the melodious music in the background and comfortable sky view chair, it was an enjoyable experience than treatment., Rather I would say it is like a dental spa.. I recommend Doctor Praveen for all age groups who are in need of painless and apt treatment for their dental problems in a very comfortable and wonderful ambience in less time",

He uses state of art techniques to give the best care to his patients. This was very evident when he decided to save one of my decayed teeth and use a Fibre composite and reconstruct the teeth which had adverse issues, and infected root canals. His perfection esp in the entire RCT process and crown alignment is something I hadn't seen in a dentist. His patience and the post op care deserves a special mention !

Photographs of each stage of the process were also shared with me. Dr. Praveen also explained in detail the all the other problems I had in my other teeth and their solutions. Definitely recommend very highly. ",

The gas is not harmful - they use it for children also - I was able to drive immediately after the procedure. It was a pain free, relaxed option and all the procedures were completed in a single sitting. There was no discomfort and I resumed a normal diet. I would wholeheartedly recommend this sedation option  to anyone who is anxious or nervous about getting dental treatment.",

Doctor was very transparent with the suggested treatment and cost involved. The entire process was painless and did not face any issue post the treatment as well as between the 2 sittings. Ambience is very good and calming. surprised by the questions asked on the choice of music as later realized this was being played at the background while the treatment was on \ud83d\ude00. Dr. Praveen was quite engaging and created a comfortable atmosphere. Definitely recommend the place for a great experience.

Dr. Praveen checked and filled a tooth in the upper jaw. Also felt a  crack in the lower tooth. It was only visible  with a x-ray .\nDr.Praveen is very professional and most friendly. He made me feel very relaxed before and during the procedure. During the procedure he was stopping often to check if I was feeling any discomfort.  He had explained what he was going to do and took photographs  at different stages and confirmed to me that what ever explained was done. \nClinic was following strict covid precautions.\nRepeated reminders in sms were sent for the follow up appointments. He had to complete the procedure in 3 sittings. \nNo more tooth pain and am able to munch and have my food without any discomfort. \nI will recommend Dr.Praveen to  any one who is having dental problems.  Especially if he/she  wants to have a route canal done. ",

I had to go abroad immediately so he did everything without removing the cap as there wasn\u2019t enough time for capping. I\u2019m scared of medical procedures but he made me very comfortable.\nI would recommend him very much :) ",
