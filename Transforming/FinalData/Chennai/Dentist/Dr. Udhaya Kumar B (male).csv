"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"Having all four impacted wisdom teeths, Now started recovering from the surgery done by Dr Udhay and Oral Max surgeon Dr. Vijay its been 10 days of extracting all 4 as in 2 teeths at once in Gap of 7 days. It was almost manageable since my age is just 22 my body started recovering with a day or two. It took 8 days to heal on one side completely.

I had constant support from him through call even at night remainding me to take my medications to keeping ice packs. 

We planned it at 9Pm at night and it took 20 mins for both upper and lower wisdom teeths. Honestly to tell it was painless for both the sides and his method of using professional technique of teeth removal did not even give me a noticeable swelling anyway which is gone in 4 days.

Other side it was horizontal impact in left lower wisdom teeth and upper tooth took more than the right side to 35mins. Its been just 2 days I am recovering from it and Im happy all four came out without causing troubles.
That my story short. Thank you very much Doctor Udhay",2021-02-20 19:25:58,False,True,sriram seshan,"Tq so much for your valuable feedback sir, pls hv a regular dental visit to avoid dental problems",2021-05-13T08:33:01+0000,Dr. Udhaya Kumar B
