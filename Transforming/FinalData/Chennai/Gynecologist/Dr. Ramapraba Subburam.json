She is very understandable and tends to observe/hear what her patients are thinking. As a well-matured professional, she can take correct decisions on time. The level of patience she exhibits is greatly appreciated.Here's a wonderful moment I'd like to share with you. A baby's birth is one of the most precious events in a person's life. One day after the delivery, Doctor cut cake at the hospital to celebrate this occasion. It was a new experience and much appreciated.",
