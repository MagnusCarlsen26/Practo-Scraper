She was very encouraging and ensured my daughter's normal delivery,  though the baby had fetal distress and my daughter developed post natal hypotension. The  immediate intervention and quick decisions of the doctor brought back their conditions to normalcy. The delivery was conducted at RPS  Hospital, where Dr. Vasanthi is a gynaec consultant. Both the clinic and hospital staff  were very hospitable and cordial. We are extremely happy that we entrusted my daughter's delivery into safe and caring hands. ",

She is very soft spoken, explained my daughter's condition at each and every step of consultation and labour. She was very encouraging and ensured my daughter's normal delivery,  though the baby had fetal distress and my daughter developed post natal hypotension. The  immediate intervention and quick decisions of the doctor brought back their conditions to normalcy. The delivery was conducted at RPS  Hospital, where Dr. Vasanthi is a gynaec consultant. Both the clinic and hospital staff  were very hospitable and cordial. We are extremely happy that we entrusted my daughter's delivery into safe and caring hands. ",
