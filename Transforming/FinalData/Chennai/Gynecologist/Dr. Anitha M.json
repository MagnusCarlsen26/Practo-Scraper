                "review_text": "Hi mommies\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, I personally wanted to share my own experience with the people who really looking for the best care taker during your pregnancy\ud83e\udd30 period till the  delivery\ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udffb, even post delivery care\ud83e\udd31\ud83c\udffb in Chennai, as people are driving a long for this particular doctor and the hospital\ud83c\udfe5. Actually the happy pregnancy journey begins with the dedicated doctor\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2695\ufe0f The mental and physical health of pre and post delivery strengthens from there. \nWhen I had high fever during the third corona wave at my 6th month of second pregnancy, even my gynecologist whom I visited till then was not ready to treat me, she suggested to go for corona ward. None of the hospitals were ready to give me the first aid atleast. But when I approached SM hospital, Dr.Suseela mam (30+ years of experience -mother of Dr.Anitha) gave me strength by gaining my confidence and suggested for some medications and the staffs there too helped alot. I got good opinion on SM hospital by then itself. Then I got to know much about Dr. Anitha mam during my 7th month of pregnancy and I was much curious to continue with her for my rest of my pregnancy journey. \nBut it was a big challenge for me to convince my husband and my family. By god's grace, one by one coincidentally we started hearing something related to SM hospital and their way of treatment. Initially it was recommended by one of my friends. Then I enquired about the same with some of the people who delivered their babies over there and their own experience. Then I searched for Google reviews too. When my husband enquired about the hospital with his colleagues they also referred SM hospital unexpectedly with their past experience. So we strongly decided to go with Dr.Anitha Mam during my 7th month of pregnancy.\nAll set when we together visited Dr.Anitha mam for the first time. In one word we can describe her as 'saviour'. She is just polite, humble, soft spoken and she never recommend for unwanted scans and medications. She spends time with her patients and for our clarifications. She always says 'nothing to worry'. She does the delivery like a piece of cake. She and her staffs always prefer to normal delivery, They wait for it too (even after long tired day with work) even if you stress for C-sec. In my case, I was thejr third patient for the day of delivery(10.30pm). I personally know they came to the hospital by 5am and was waiting for my delivery till 11pm. They had to come again next day for a surgery at 5am..Though none of their labor ward staff show that tiredness in their face. They helped much for my comfort at the labor ward. They discharged me in 24hrs. I am a happy mom now with the blessed just born baby. Our family had a life time feel good memories with SM hospital and Dr. Anitha mam. I strongly recommend her for the safest delivery.\n Adding to it, It is not a money motive hospital, it is very very affordable at cost when compared to other hospitals in Chennai, patient friendly one. And my husband was permitted with me in the labor ward during the whole delivery process. I thank Sister Aleyamma who was with me throughout the process and cheered me till the last minute . Dr.Anitha Mam, you should live a long to bring many more beautiful souls to the world \ud83d\udc9d. Love you Mam!!\nTotal Lobor period: 5hrs\nDelivery mode: Normal vaginal delivery.",

I had come to know about SM through one of my cousins. Would have been happy to have known about the Doctor & the Hosp during my first pregnancy as well.  I decided to have my hubby & the 5 year elder kid along with me. I was bit paranoid of not having a female attender for my delivery more so for postpartum handling of baby & the breast feeding. But with a very good support of nurses & the duty Docs. at SM, which they extended round the clock, we were able to handle it well.  They took utmost care of us during our stay. There was no havoc or urgency created for settling the bills nor getting the medicines from the pharmacy.  Unless warranted they don\u2019t make you stay for more than 3 days even if it\u2019s a C-sec. This maternity hospital stood out for their simple processes yet most satisfying delivery. In our considered opinion, this doctor, nurses and the hospital together give a super cool environment for one to get past one of the most crucial moments of life.",

From the day1 we met Dr. Anitha we felt very secure that we finally reached to the right place.  She is so cool ,simple dedicated and experienced person who handled my labor successfully without giving up for any reason.  I had my normal vaginal delivery on 25th of may.  Went with labor pain to sm, duty drs and staffs took immediate utmost care and Dr. Anitha reached to hospital irrespective of her hospital hrs for my delivery during this lockdown. Without her,  my normal delivery wouldn't have happened.. She is an iron lady :-) put all her strength and helped to took my  baby out successfully when I felt tough to push and struggled to bring out the baby for one hour and lost all my hope.  All Sm staff nurses are very dedicative towards their work and very supportive to the patients. Special thanks to Dr. Edal Queen who is very friendliest during my labor..  I really thankful to Dr. Anitha and all SM nurses.  I Could say SM is an excellent exclusive hospital in chennai for maternal care which I can proudly recommend to all my friends and colleagues. ",

I believe that these 9 months are very precious and one always wants them the best as anything can go wrong at any point. So it is very important at this time to have good support, especially on the healthcare front especially from the doctors. \n\nAnita mam certainly is an amazing doctor and even 5 minutes with her can make you feel so much at ease and she gives support at every step throughout the pregnancy. She was always available for all my queries. The best thing about her is how she focuses on natural birth and waits till the end. During the entire tenure of pregnancy she always motivated me to stay active and eat healthy. She also goes in for minimal medications and testing and believes that a natural process like pregnancy needs no intervention unless really required. We feel really grateful & are happy we chose SM Hospital for our baby\u2019s arrival. \n\nMy overall experience at the hospital has been awesome. The services have been very nice, everyone from the housekeeping to the nursing staff and the whole team has been very kind and helpful and made me feel most comfortable always. All of them were so dedicative towards their work and were literally available everytime when we wanted their support and help. One of the few hospitals where quality meets affordability. Super satisfied with everything & would definitely recommend her and the hospital to everyone for safest delivery \u2764\ufe0f\n\n",

Private rooms are reasonably priced, very clean, and equipped with a TV and a cabinet.After intensive research, it was a blessing for us to visit this hospital.Without your medical guidance, my nine months of pregnancy may have been a nightmare.

                "review_text": "Hi mommies\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, I personally wanted to share my own experience with the people who really looking for the best care taker during your pregnancy\ud83e\udd30 period till the  delivery\ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udffb, even post delivery care\ud83e\udd31\ud83c\udffb in Chennai, as people are driving a long for this particular doctor and the hospital\ud83c\udfe5. Actually the happy pregnancy journey begins with the dedicated doctor\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2695\ufe0f The mental and physical health of pre and post delivery strengthens from there. \nWhen I had high fever during the third corona wave at my 6th month of second pregnancy, even my gynecologist whom I visited till then was not ready to treat me, she suggested to go for corona ward. None of the hospitals were ready to give me the first aid atleast. But when I approached SM hospital, Dr.Suseela mam (30+ years of experience -mother of Dr.Anitha) gave me strength by gaining my confidence and suggested for some medications and the staffs there too helped alot. I got good opinion on SM hospital by then itself. Then I got to know much about Dr. Anitha mam during my 7th month of pregnancy and I was much curious to continue with her for my rest of my pregnancy journey. \nBut it was a big challenge for me to convince my husband and my family. By god's grace, one by one coincidentally we started hearing something related to SM hospital and their way of treatment. Initially it was recommended by one of my friends. Then I enquired about the same with some of the people who delivered their babies over there and their own experience. Then I searched for Google reviews too. When my husband enquired about the hospital with his colleagues they also referred SM hospital unexpectedly with their past experience. So we strongly decided to go with Dr.Anitha Mam during my 7th month of pregnancy.\nAll set when we together visited Dr.Anitha mam for the first time. In one word we can describe her as 'saviour'. She is just polite, humble, soft spoken and she never recommend for unwanted scans and medications. She spends time with her patients and for our clarifications. She always says 'nothing to worry'. She does the delivery like a piece of cake. She and her staffs always prefer to normal delivery, They wait for it too (even after long tired day with work) even if you stress for C-sec. In my case, I was thejr third patient for the day of delivery(10.30pm). I personally know they came to the hospital by 5am and was waiting for my delivery till 11pm. They had to come again next day for a surgery at 5am..Though none of their labor ward staff show that tiredness in their face. They helped much for my comfort at the labor ward. They discharged me in 24hrs. I am a happy mom now with the blessed just born baby. Our family had a life time feel good memories with SM hospital and Dr. Anitha mam. I strongly recommend her for the safest delivery.\n Adding to it, It is not a money motive hospital, it is very very affordable at cost when compared to other hospitals in Chennai, patient friendly one. And my husband was permitted with me in the labor ward during the whole delivery process. I thank Sister Aleyamma who was with me throughout the process and cheered me till the last minute . Dr.Anitha Mam, you should live a long to bring many more beautiful souls to the world \ud83d\udc9d. Love you Mam!!\nTotal Lobor period: 5hrs\nDelivery mode: Normal vaginal delivery.",

I had come to know about SM through one of my cousins. Would have been happy to have known about the Doctor & the Hosp during my first pregnancy as well.  I decided to have my hubby & the 5 year elder kid along with me. I was bit paranoid of not having a female attender for my delivery more so for postpartum handling of baby & the breast feeding. But with a very good support of nurses & the duty Docs. at SM, which they extended round the clock, we were able to handle it well.  They took utmost care of us during our stay. There was no havoc or urgency created for settling the bills nor getting the medicines from the pharmacy.  Unless warranted they don\u2019t make you stay for more than 3 days even if it\u2019s a C-sec. This maternity hospital stood out for their simple processes yet most satisfying delivery. In our considered opinion, this doctor, nurses and the hospital together give a super cool environment for one to get past one of the most crucial moments of life.",

From the day1 we met Dr. Anitha we felt very secure that we finally reached to the right place.  She is so cool ,simple dedicated and experienced person who handled my labor successfully without giving up for any reason.  I had my normal vaginal delivery on 25th of may.  Went with labor pain to sm, duty drs and staffs took immediate utmost care and Dr. Anitha reached to hospital irrespective of her hospital hrs for my delivery during this lockdown. Without her,  my normal delivery wouldn't have happened.. She is an iron lady :-) put all her strength and helped to took my  baby out successfully when I felt tough to push and struggled to bring out the baby for one hour and lost all my hope.  All Sm staff nurses are very dedicative towards their work and very supportive to the patients. Special thanks to Dr. Edal Queen who is very friendliest during my labor..  I really thankful to Dr. Anitha and all SM nurses.  I Could say SM is an excellent exclusive hospital in chennai for maternal care which I can proudly recommend to all my friends and colleagues. ",

I believe that these 9 months are very precious and one always wants them the best as anything can go wrong at any point. So it is very important at this time to have good support, especially on the healthcare front especially from the doctors. \n\nAnita mam certainly is an amazing doctor and even 5 minutes with her can make you feel so much at ease and she gives support at every step throughout the pregnancy. She was always available for all my queries. The best thing about her is how she focuses on natural birth and waits till the end. During the entire tenure of pregnancy she always motivated me to stay active and eat healthy. She also goes in for minimal medications and testing and believes that a natural process like pregnancy needs no intervention unless really required. We feel really grateful & are happy we chose SM Hospital for our baby\u2019s arrival. \n\nMy overall experience at the hospital has been awesome. The services have been very nice, everyone from the housekeeping to the nursing staff and the whole team has been very kind and helpful and made me feel most comfortable always. All of them were so dedicative towards their work and were literally available everytime when we wanted their support and help. One of the few hospitals where quality meets affordability. Super satisfied with everything & would definitely recommend her and the hospital to everyone for safest delivery \u2764\ufe0f\n\n",

She also spent time listening throughout each examination. Private rooms are reasonably priced, very clean, and equipped with a TV and a cabinet.After intensive research, it was a blessing for us to visit this hospital.Without your medical guidance, my nine months of pregnancy may have been a nightmare.

I went to Dr Anitha within 40days of my pregnancy for an emergency scan since I had severe stomach cramps on a Sunday and she was so patient and helped me calm down and told me everything was fine. Her experience can be seen when she was precise with all her observations starting from by when the head will be fixed till almost the time I would deliver the baby when my contractions began. I had a normal vaginal delivery and the Dr was with me throughout the process despite being a Sunday again. She helped me feel so much at ease both during the delivery and after it. Gives you confidence and encourages you to get back to your normal life. Just follow the Dr's instructions and you will definitely have a smooth pregnancy and delivery. For my first pregnancy I really couldn't ask for anything more than this.",

Dr. Anitha is very empathetic in her treatment towards the patient. She will not hide any complications but at the same time after talking to her you will feel relaxed and secure. She gives proper time and attention, gives answers to all your questions. And the best part is in case of emergency she is always available. In my fourth month..I got some complication in night at 1 o clk... we rushed to hospital and she came within 5 minutes.   All in All very much satisfied with the doctor.

The service and support extended through the pregnancies and post delivery are highly commendable.\n\nThis is one of the very few hospitals where quality meets affordability.  The nursing staff and doctors here are very cordial and professional and tend to your needs with utmost sincerity. \n\nAnd Dr. Anitha, I must say that she is one of the coolest doctors I\u2019ve met thus far.  She has always made me feel at ease with her clear and honest communications for all our doubts and queries. The positivity she exuberates gives you the much needed confidence to make through your journey of pregnancy.  She definitely made both pregnancies easy for me with ample support and her skilful guidance and care.\n\nI would highly recommend Dr. Anitha and SM Hospital to anyone looking for good healthcare services.",

Would also like to appreciate the medical staffs who took care of us all the time be it day or night. Whenever the staffs hear the baby cry, they had come for support without even calling.\n",

Her postop pain and discomfort was very minimal and it was managed well by her and support team of the anesthesiologist and staff.  Today, is postop day #4 and  she is  almost back to 75% of her norm.   We were very fortunate to have had surgery with Dr. Anitha  I also would like to add that all the support nursing staff at SM Hospital are very cordial and responds well when approached.  We want to thank each and everyone of them for their warm gesture during our stay.  The hospital itself is kept very clean and the ambiance helps in quick recovery.    \n",
