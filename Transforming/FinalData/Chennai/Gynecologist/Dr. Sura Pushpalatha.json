Worried? Panicked? \nThe moment you see her smiling face it will vanish. She will give you complete positivity that your baby is fine.  \nI had bit high sugar levels from my 7th month due to which my water levels had increased. She suggested me to cut down sugar and asked me to check sugar every week. She then suggested a diet and inspite of diet my sugar didn't come down only then she started tablet for me. \nI had no pains till 39th week. Since my sugar was high and she wanted me to have normal delivery she suggested to induce labour in 39th week and 3 days. \n\nSpecial mention about her before and after my labour. Since it was my first pregnancy, I was super scared and due to which heart rates of me and my baby were high. All she told me was not to worry, it's a natural process and asked me to relax and go with the flow. \n\nI was 4cm dilated at 10:30 pm and doctor rushed to the hospital after that. \nShe patiently waited for me to be 10 cm dilated, gave me strength and kept motivating me. During the pushing stage she encouraged me to breathe in breathe out and asked me to push when the pain started. She gave me complete support.  Since my baby wasn't coming out she tried to pull her with vacuum  pump . After trying twice my baby didn't come out. She didn't give up and tried again after which my baby came out safely at 3:05 am.\nI had a safe and normal delivery all credits to Dr Sura mam.\n\nAfter my stitches process was done , doctor made sure to come and check on me by holding my hand and Since I was emotional, I poured my heart out to her and she patiently listened to me and consoled me and started to her home at 5 am. \n\nReally the best gynecologist ever! \nPregnant? Trying to get pregnant? Go to her with complete faith. She will take care of the rest! Highly recommend all ladies to go to her! \nLiving angel on earth \ud83c\udf0e \u2728\ufe0f ",

She was my 5th doctor i consulted luckily* *** * ****** *** *** ** *** **** ***** *** ** ***** She is friendly enough to hear all our fears n doubts and then tells us what is right to do without making us panic. I have been visiting so many gynics in chennai for past 9yrs for infertility issues, but never found someone so comfortable to talk. She made the scariest person in me to be bold n strong enough to face it. Atlast i ended up getting my surgery done by her and her post surgery talks and advises were also very good. I highly recommend her for people who are scared n worried to see gynics. Thanks mam, i am relieved from everything because you gave me confidence.",

Worried? Panicked? \nThe moment you see her smiling face it will vanish. She will give you complete positivity that your baby is fine.  \nI had bit high sugar levels from my 7th month due to which my water levels had increased. She suggested me to cut down sugar and asked me to check sugar every week. She then suggested a diet and inspite of diet my sugar didn't come down only then she started tablet for me. \nI had no pains till 39th week. Since my sugar was high and she wanted me to have normal delivery she suggested to induce labour in 39th week and 3 days. \n\nSpecial mention about her before and after my labour. Since it was my first pregnancy, I was super scared and due to which heart rates of me and my baby were high. All she told me was not to worry, it's a natural process and asked me to relax and go with the flow. \n\nI was 4cm dilated at 10:30 pm and doctor rushed to the hospital after that. \nShe patiently waited for me to be 10 cm dilated, gave me strength and kept motivating me. During the pushing stage she encouraged me to breathe in breathe out and asked me to push when the pain started. She gave me complete support.  Since my baby wasn't coming out she tried to pull her with vacuum  pump . After trying twice my baby didn't come out. She didn't give up and tried again after which my baby came out safely at 3:05 am.\nI had a safe and normal delivery all credits to Dr Sura mam.\n\nAfter my stitches process was done , doctor made sure to come and check on me by holding my hand and Since I was emotional, I poured my heart out to her and she patiently listened to me and consoled me and started to her home at 5 am. \n\nReally the best gynecologist ever! \nPregnant? Trying to get pregnant? Go to her with complete faith. She will take care of the rest! Highly recommend all ladies to go to her! \nLiving angel on earth \ud83c\udf0e \u2728\ufe0f ",

I have been visiting so many gynics in chennai for past 9yrs for infertility issues, but never found someone so comfortable to talk. She made the scariest person in me to be bold n strong enough to face it. Atlast i ended up getting my surgery done by her and her post surgery talks and advises were also very good. I highly recommend her for people who are scared n worried to see gynics. Thanks mam, i am relieved from everything because you gave me confidence.",

I had bad experience today, Hospital administration does not have a common sense for pregnent women's. For changing doctor name ,they ask me to go with several procedure to get sign from attainder / department.people should think twice before going to global hospital, they don't care your critical situation of patient just they wanted to full fill own statement until you don't do . Admin will not allow you to go to doctor.  I won't suggest you to go to global hospital ... its a place for very bad administration.",
