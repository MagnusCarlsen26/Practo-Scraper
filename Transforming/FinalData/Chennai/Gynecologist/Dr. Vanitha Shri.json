I don't recommend this doctor if you are planning for normal delivery. She thinks that normal delivery is time wasted and she could have done more than 1 delivery during that time. My wife had so much complications post pregnancy due to C section. When we asked same to doctor, she tried to convince us saying she also had C section. \nIn summary, you can go to her for consultation and not baby delivery. ",

Though pregnancy checks were all fine, we were not convinced with her approach towards baby delivery. She wanted to do C section and finish the job. She wasn't willing to wait for normal delivery. I don't recommend this doctor if you are planning for normal delivery. She thinks that normal delivery is time wasted and she could have done more than 1 delivery during that time. My wife had so much complications post pregnancy due to C section. When we asked same to doctor, she tried to convince us saying she also had C section. \nIn summary, you can go to her for consultation and not baby delivery. ",

She made me feel comfortable first and allowed me to talk about my inhibitions which I had. Then she clearly and patiently explained. Her friendly smile gave me confidence and her practical advice of taking a regular walk and exercise for my well-being boosted me.",

She constantly monitored me and baby during the surgery and ensured a successful and safe procedure . \nDuring pregnancy I had placenta previa\\/low lying placenta , she constantly kept a check on this condition till the very last day and I successfully completed the full term period for my baby without any further complication and delivered a healthy baby .\nShe helped us sail through this very emotional and challenging journey of 2+ years not only as a professional doctor but also counselled us time to time emotionally and provided a very personalized treatment approach . We are very thankful to come across her through our journey from couple to parents.\n",

I was initially reviewing with a doctor who terrorized me saying an IUGR baby, loaded me with medications emptying her pharmacy, but i went alarming with this problem to her , i and.my family.members were really peaceful right from.the first review itself.  I am a person who is afraid right from injections to hospitalisations, i had a breech baby and i had no choice to go for c section., the moment when i heard this, she was the fullest support mentally and.physically. I am now recovered from a c section just because of her full motivation, support and her way of treatment. No doctor will ever be of full support like her, be it calling her at midnights even , giving a whatsapp support. The most friendliest and experienced doctor who can make you very comfortable to any Gynac problems, above all is her positive motivation and her prayers too for her patients. ",

My second visit to her was when i got conceived.She  gave her words in a very positive way regarding my pregnancy complications.She took much care throughout my pregnancy period.She cares much for the patients health. Though most of the doctors we consulted said i have more complications and less probablity of becoming a mother , only because of vanitha mam  am holding my little princess in  hand now. Im very much thankful to vanitha mam for her care towards me throughout my pregnancy.We strongly recommend  Vanitha shri mam\n\n",

She is  very a good care taker too. Through out my pregnancy she kept me very comfortable and supported me a lot and educated me well. Irrespective of whatever busy she is she responds properly.",

She speaks to the point and is keen on finding the issue. She explains the issue in a simple way and patiently answers our queries. \nDr. Vanitha first identified the issue & then very smoothly worked to correct it to help me conceive. I could blindly trust her through my successful treatment, pregnancy and delivery. Despite some minor issues, I had a very smooth delivery. \nThanks to Dr. Vanitha Shri for her perseverance and dedication to her job. God bless her. I can anytime vouch for her and have already recommended 2 of my friends who are now gladly consulting her. \n\nNote: I have consulted her both at Apollo & at Progress Speciality Clinic",
