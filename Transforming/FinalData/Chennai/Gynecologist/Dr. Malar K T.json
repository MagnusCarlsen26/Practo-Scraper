After a mishap in my previous pregnancy, we were very worried about our next one and wanted to ensure that we get the best treatment and care so we have a successful delivery. That\u2019s when we came across Dr. Malar\u2019s profile in the website and went ahead for consultation. Truth be told, she handled us with utmost care and compassion. We know we were overwhelmed many times and went to her with many requests but she ensured that all our requests were answered and fulfilled. We successfully delivered our baby and we would not hesitate to say that it is because of Dr. Malar that our dream has now come true. She was very professional and at the same time ensured she gave us her complete attention throughout our pregnancy from the day of conception till the day of discharge from hospital post delivery. A special call out to nurses Jenifer and Priya who were assisting us 24/7 despite of the number of doubts and requests we had. They made it easier for us to be connected with the doctor without interruption and coordinated very well. Also, thanks to Ramu from CRE who helped us with the operational requirements, admissions and other administrative responsibilities. During my admission in the hospital all the duty doctors, nurses and even the house cleaning team were so impressively caring and helpful. Overall we had the best experience with Dr. Malar and Cloudnine, OMR.",

You can blindly trust the treatment she gives unlike most of other doctors prevailing these days. She doesn't prescribe any tests or medicines unless highly essential. If anyone is looking for a doctor and not an entrepreneur then it can be none other than her. I wish she were a pediatrician too so that my kids too will get the **** doctor. She is that ******* *** nice. Hats off to her.  She is one doctor and woman i look upon. Really astonished at her professionalism and ethics she has. ",
