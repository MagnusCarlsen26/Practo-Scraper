Since the beginning from getting pregnant to delivering our little one. She has been very clear about things and made us feel comfortable and confident. I remember Misha madam's words very clearly, on the day of the tube test madam said \"I will make sure that you will become a mother\". And she helped us in every way possible.

Misha mam was so supportive thorough out our entire  pregnancy process. Inspite of her busy schedule and multiple appointment we wonder how she was able to give same level of detailing and attention every time we visited her. We are sure that she gives same attention to every single patient who visit her every time. One cannot simply do this all the time, unless they are so dedicated to their profession. No matter what time it is, she is always available for her patients either through call or whatsapp whenever they need. In the past we have seen doctor's who carry vast knowledge, very good command over the language but zero empathetic or zero compassionate, with average listening skills. ** *** ***** **** ***** *** **** * **** ********* *** ********** ** *** ****** ** a very good listener who is very empathetic and humane towards her patients. In our life time we will come across only very few doctors with this combination of being strong, outspoken at the same time empathetic and compassionate towards their patients. Misha mam is one such of a gem. We were overwhelmed with the flexibility and understanding that Misha mam has shown for our personal requests, especially during the delivery, post care and discharge. Definitely she carries a positive aura around her wherever she goes. We would highly recommend this doctor for anyone who is looking for a wonderful and dedicated gynecologist.\n\nPS : Ours was a risky pregnancy with placenta previa, transverse lie and high BP (at the time of delivery). Mam tried her fullest to push me for a  normal delivery But my little princess was always in move in my womb  even after 38 weeks so we had no option but to go for c section . Post delivery mam checked on me daily to ensure I am recovering well. She gave many useful recommendations following which I was able to walk the second day and got discharged 3rd day.\n\nThanks & Regards\nPrathiba Manikandan",

After that we started a treatment for pregnancy from 2021 by following her guidance. Initially started with a follicular study of 6 cycles are failed and then we moved to IUI that also failed for 4 cycles. Meanwhile, we took a lot of breaks in treatment due to stress. Eventhough mam gaves a positive hope and continue the treatment without any hesitation. Atlast mam suggested D'Lap, we had gone through following which 5th cycle of IUI done and I conceived. From the beginning of confirming my pregnancy, mam took a lot of care for us. Unfortunately it was my first pregnancy, I came to my native in 7th month. And continue my treatment in native. Now I have my prince in my hand because of angel Dr.Misha mam. Once again thank you so much mam from myself and my entire family.",

I would like to call out her empathy and kindness during the entire process. \n\nMam also was a great support during the pregnancy. We had some scares/incidents  during pregnancy, but mam was very supportive and encouraged us as a very dear friend. She explained the reasons and gave needed treatment and practical guidance. Her clinic staff are also very helpful.\n\nMam has always motivated  exercises to encourage \"normal\" delivery. The exercise classes were helpful. By God's grace, we had a short labour and delivery.  There were some minor complications, but she did her level best for normal delivery, and we are blessed with a baby girl. She has continued to support us.\n\nDr.Misha mam has been available every step of the way and has gone above and beyond of what is expected of her.",

No words to explain how Dr Misha Pepsi mam took care of me from day 1 till delivery. Myself didn't expect for a normal delivery but it was all possible by support and care given by Dr Misha Pepsi mam. At midnight you kept track of me when we were unaware of the pain whether it's labour pain or normal,and madam was available early morning inspite of late night phone calls. We thank you so much for helping us in this journey, which is unforgettable in our life.Each time your positive approach helped us . Your service is a blessing to many couples who urge for a baby. Thank you Tamil mam for your exercises which helped me a lot. My friend Vishnupriya who is really a God sent messenger who referred about Misha mam. Thanks for the entire team of Misha Pepsi Mam.",

Since the beginning from getting pregnant to delivering our little one. She has been very clear about things and made us feel comfortable and confident. I remember Misha madam's words very clearly, on the day of the tube test madam said \"I will make sure that you will become a mother\". And she helped us in every way possible. The trust we had in Misha madam, just made us follow her every suggestion. *** ** *** **** ****** ** ***** **** ***** *** ****",

Misha mam was so supportive thorough out our entire  pregnancy process. Inspite of her busy schedule and multiple appointment we wonder how she was able to give same level of detailing and attention every time we visited her. We are sure that she gives same attention to every single patient who visit her every time. One cannot simply do this all the time, unless they are so dedicated to their profession. No matter what time it is, she is always available for her patients either through call or whatsapp whenever they need. In the past we have seen doctor's who carry vast knowledge, very good command over the language but zero empathetic or zero compassionate, with average listening skills. ** *** ***** **** ***** *** **** * **** ********* *** ********** ** *** ****** ** a very good listener who is very empathetic and humane towards her patients. In our life time we will come across only very few doctors with this combination of being strong, outspoken at the same time empathetic and compassionate towards their patients. Misha mam is one such of a gem. We were overwhelmed with the flexibility and understanding that Misha mam has shown for our personal requests, especially during the delivery, post care and discharge. Definitely she carries a positive aura around her wherever she goes. We would highly recommend this doctor for anyone who is looking for a wonderful and dedicated gynecologist.\n\nPS : Ours was a risky pregnancy with placenta previa, transverse lie and high BP (at the time of delivery). Mam tried her fullest to push me for a  normal delivery But my little princess was always in move in my womb  even after 38 weeks so we had no option but to go for c section . Post delivery mam checked on me daily to ensure I am recovering well. She gave many useful recommendations following which I was able to walk the second day and got discharged 3rd day.\n\nThanks & Regards\nPrathiba Manikandan",

After that we started a treatment for pregnancy from 2021 by following her guidance. Initially started with a follicular study of 6 cycles are failed and then we moved to IUI that also failed for 4 cycles. Meanwhile, we took a lot of breaks in treatment due to stress. Eventhough mam gaves a positive hope and continue the treatment without any hesitation. Atlast mam suggested D'Lap, we had gone through following which 5th cycle of IUI done and I conceived. From the beginning of confirming my pregnancy, mam took a lot of care for us. Unfortunately it was my first pregnancy, I came to my native in 7th month. And continue my treatment in native. Now I have my prince in my hand because of angel Dr.Misha mam. Once again thank you so much mam from myself and my entire family.",

I would like to call out her empathy and kindness during the entire process. \n\nMam also was a great support during the pregnancy. We had some scares/incidents  during pregnancy, but mam was very supportive and encouraged us as a very dear friend. She explained the reasons and gave needed treatment and practical guidance. Her clinic staff are also very helpful.\n\nMam has always motivated  exercises to encourage \"normal\" delivery. The exercise classes were helpful. By God's grace, we had a short labour and delivery.  There were some minor complications, but she did her level best for normal delivery, and we are blessed with a baby girl.

No words to explain how Dr Misha Pepsi mam took care of me from day 1 till delivery. Myself didn't expect for a normal delivery but it was all possible by support and care given by Dr Misha Pepsi mam. At midnight you kept track of me when we were unaware of the pain whether it's labour pain or normal,and madam was available early morning inspite of late night phone calls. We thank you so much for helping us in this journey, which is unforgettable in our life.Each time your positive approach helped us . Your service is a blessing to many couples who urge for a baby. Thank you Tamil mam for your exercises which helped me a lot. My friend Vishnupriya who is really a God sent messenger who referred about Misha mam. Thanks for the entire team of Misha Pepsi Mam.",

                "review_text": "Hi everyone, this is Nandhini blessed with baby boy on 26th May. I was initially in Kanchipuram for first 3 months and consulted one doctor. Next 3 months I was at my MIL place ie Karaikudi,for time being consulted another doctor . When I came back to kanchipuram in 7th month. doctors at my place denied to give treatment & not accept me as they don't hv trust on me that I will continue in their hospital till delivery. So I hv no other option, that time my relative Tanya referred Misha mam to me. I have no one at Chennai to take care of me so initially I was not interested so I just ignored her. Then one day I came to Chennai for some other work ,so me and my husband decided to meet Misha mam once. We visited her once and we loved the way she spoke to us. She was very open and listens to all of our queries and answered clearly. Last 3 months she took care of me.I got admitted at hospital on 24th May as that was my due date and I didn't get any symptoms for labor. She gave gel for pain induce at 24th night, I had contraction that day night but cervix was not open. Next day 25th morning again she gave one more gel for pain induce I had contraction whole day but cervix was 1cm dilated. 26th early morning she gave trips at 5.30am for pain induce I had heavy contraction but cervix was still 1cm only till 8.30am. She tried her best to make it as normal but baby head was not closer so without any other option I had c section and baby was born at 9.03am. During labor she was telling me stories and all even she asked me what song I want to listen and as per my wish she played Ilayaraja songs for me\ud83e\udd70 I made right decision by coming to you mam. I believed you mam and I never regret by going for c section as you tried all possibilities. I saw everyone in this group mentioning you as an angel even I experienced it mam. You are an Angel mam \u2764\ufe0f we blessed to have baby from your hand\ud83d\ude0d\n\n *Few words from my Hubby:* \n\nFirst of all i thank Misha mam.I wonder the way she gave treatment with care and transparency. When pain inducing medicine was given to my wife at night 10pm ,She asked me to monitor her and note down the pain level whole night in 10mins interval ie,in 10 min ,4pain in 45sec. I was sending this every hour to her through whatsapp whole night and she was replying back in next min,Iam wondering does Angel don't sleep\ud83d\ude4a(sending the snap this might help some future Dad\ud83d\ude07).I was really happy and that was a nice experience to take care my wife along with her by sharing her pain(oly Tough task which I did happily\ud83e\udd2a).No hidden or trial & error  treatment,it's perfect and her experience speaks everywhere.I was eagerly waiting to go along  with my wife to labor room,Unfortunately It was C section and I was roaming outside like kutty pota Cat\ud83d\udc08.on 26th May,9.03am ,Misha mam conveyed me a happy news that I was become Dad and inside theatre,my wife was listening Ilayaraja songs,(was she kidding me, I was thinking inside\ud83d\ude48) .Iam thanking Misha mam once again and I request everyone to stay safe and vaccinated. Happy Parenting to everyone\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66\ud83e\udd30\ud83d\udc7c\ud83c\udffc",

                "review_text": "I would like to share my experience of birth of my Princess. The first time when I visited her, I was really happy with her friendliness, how patiently she answered all my questions and she was so polite and patient to answer all my silly questions as well. But the thing which I really liked about her was, when she said \"you and baby is more important to me, so take care, eat healthy and u don't have to worry for anything else\" and that really touched me. At the very first visit, she asked me to call her or text her in case of any doubts or emergency. I remember, during pregnancy I had little complication and when I called Doctor Misha, she was not in town but eventhough she wasn't here I felt her presence as she managed everything perfectly; she asked me to go and check with a specific doctor and send her reports through whatsapp but what Amazed me more about her was, when she returned back, the very same morning she asked me to come and meet her to make sure everything is perfect.I had bp problem throughout my pregnancy and she was always there to guide me, motivate me and always there with her positive words to overcome any thoughts which was troubling me.When I was near my edd, I got symptoms of eclampsia which Doctor Misha noticed and started following up with me every few hours. I was in awe of her, when she called me like at every few hours to check on my bp and then she called me around 12 in the morning to check if my bp is okay and since it was really high, she asked me to get admitted as we had to do emergency C section. I was really scared cause everything was happening so fast and as my Edd was 13 May and it was only 6th May and at the same time I was relaxed knowing that Doctor Misha is there, as she always took care of me and the baby. I reached hospital around 1: 30 am, Doctor Misha was already on the way and when she came to see me, she said \"she will not take any chance with my life or baby's life and she will take care of everything and soon I will have my baby in my arms\" and when she said those words, that little fear which I had before coming to hospital, everything was gone and I was more n more excited to meet my little one and soon after I am blessed with a baby girl.Really Hats off to her dedication, as even in in this lockdown situation, she was there in hospital early in the morning and she also arranged anesthetist and pediatrician that too around 2 am.After delivery when she came to see me, I was really happy to see her, as she told me that she will make sure everything goes perfectly and I dont have to go through lot of pain. Before leaving the hospital, she asked me to call her in case of any severe pain or doubts. And she was constantly following up with nurses in the hospital and getting update on me and baby.But due to unexpected circumstances I had to get discharge from hospital soon after delivery, even after that she was constantly texting and calling to check on me and baby.When I couldn't visit her after delivery, she did video call to make sure everything is perfect. I am really thankful to Dr Misha for everything she did throughout my pregnancy, for all the care and support and even now when I contact her, she is always there to help me out.Ladies, trust me.. you don't have to be worried about anything, *** *** *** **** ******* she will always make sure that the mother and baby is safe and healthy.To Doctor Misha, Thank u so much for everything, from the first time when I met you; you were always there for me as a sister guiding me, motivating me throughout my pregnancy and I am really lucky that I met you.",

I was facing fibroid issue and single umbilical artery. The thing is I had my check ups in one hospital and final stage I have been moved to another hospital because of covid severity which was very much a last min surprise for me. God's Grace atlast me and baby was doing well except with the result of covid- positive which made my baby to loose breast milk. I thought that was my hectic period and I have been saved by God but there was another major health problem which I didn't even notified.\n\nSecond pregnancy ( second baby - boy - this month August)\n\nAgain I was having my regular check ups with my usual hospital.suddenly at my fifth month I got very much afraid as covid severity was increasing and I was rolled out with the imagination of last year and I thought of put an end to the usual hospital for check ups. Beside this I skipped one month check up (6th month) because of this panic situation. At seventh month I remembered Dr. Misha pepsi mam to whom I went check up for once last year at ninth month where mam instructed me that I should strictly go with normal delivery beyond the visibility of fibroid as it is not going to play a major role in normal delivery and I was very much afraid of normal delivery  which made to put an end to her visit.\n\nTo be very Frank at this pregnancy for first check up (7th mnth) I really don't have confidence as I have changed my gyno at last moment. From second check up she gave me very much confidence and i literally says that I want your presence mam pls be beside me even if am stated as covid positive and you gonna move me to some other hospital. This was my tharaga mantra for all check ups I went. Her words were very positive saying like \"you are not going to be in that state and am the one who gonna deliver your baby for sure so don't worry\". Happily 7th and 8th month passed with her positive words.\n\nHere comes the most surprise I faced at ninth month. I was asked to take ecg/echo and I was notified that I have ASD in heart ( hole in heart from child birth). This has been stated in my previous pregnancy report itself but because of covid severity I was not notified about this and I went with c sec without any kind of emergency precautions. God saved me. \n\nNo words to describe this situation. Mam gave me full support and she was much prepared than me for my delivery by getting cardiologist opinion and anesthesiologist opinion. Finally I was in delivery bed for c sec again. Mam the baby successfully and she noticed the fibroid which I had was half decayed and in the stage of spreading infection. It was not planned to remove but it was great that she removed and saved my life.\n\n These are the words from my heart where I really saw her as my another mom and I felt very much lucky to have her in this pregnancy. \n\nAll the moms here- feel lucky and happy that you are in the safe hands for your pregnancy journey\n\nThank you so much for all your support mam!!",

We read multiple reviews and suggestions from friends and its led us to Selva Maternity Clinic and Dr. Misha Pepsi. Since this is our first baby we had n number of questions and doubts throughout the pregnancy. But LUCKILY we got Dr.Misha Pepsi. When we went for the first check up, the way she greeted was so warm and also when the check up was done she said \"Baby is so beautiful,awesome and Happy Motherhood\", with the real josh, which makes us happy and gave strong faith on her.\n\nFurther visits we just stopped worrying about pregnancy and we just put everything on her head. Going to clinic became visiting friends home and meeting her became meeting a family member. We literally starts waiting for the consultation date to come. She explains everything in detail, she made sure that her patients are completely aware of the issue, treatment and drugs they are going take. Most importantly she is available for her patients any time. I would like to reiterate the word ANYTIME.\n\nI would like to share an incident happened to us, our baby didnt move for more than 12 hours when i am on my 6th month. Since we started noticing it at night we thought of wait till morning, at morning also we didnt find any movement, we were thinking it as normal and reached her around noon. She immediately asked us to come, when checked she confirmed the heartbeat but to check the movement she advised us to take the Doppler (scan) immediately. Since it was a holiday there were no scan center available to do, she herself called a specialist and make it available for us. We went to the place and waited for a while with all of fear. After an hour we got the call from Doctor to check the status and we said we are waiting for the specialist to come. Soon, we surprised to see our doctor came all the way to the place where we are waiting for the scan and was with us till the baby moves. We were literally impressed to see such thing from a doctor. We could sense how seriously and passionately she is doing the profession.\n\nDoctor will be available 24/7 for her patient. More than a doctor she is such a lovely human who politely answers all her patients queries. \n\nLove you doctor and just because of your advice and care we have a prince now with us. We are blessed. Thanks a ton Doctor. :) \n\nReason to choose:\n1. You'll get clear explanation on things\n2. Doctor will be greet and treat you with smile\n3. Doctor will be available for your anytime\n4. Doctor will guide you all the way to normal and happy delivery\n5. She is not paisa minded, she is doing this as service, the charges are pretty much less when compared with others in the market\n6. You can enjoy your every consultations",

It is indeed not something which work likes a machine. Oh, when talking about my pregnancy and my Arlin, how can I forget Dr. Misha? \nMy dear Doctor Misha, this truly happened with all your health support and advices, you were amazing and you really are. We were amazed with your support even when I was 3000 miles away and consulting another gynecologist. \nI spent my first 5 months of pregnancy in a tiny island in Maldives which hardly has medical facilities; the Gyne we were consulting was an introvert, and pulling words from his mouth was easier than giving birth I believe. He advised not fly back to India also we need to travel more than an hour by a speedboat to reach the Airport, which made me to spend 5 months in a stoneage. I was helpless and I decided to take an advice over the phone. Amazingly, we had an excellent response from Dr. Misha, she was so helpful and I felt relaxed. Somehow we reached India after 5 months and gave my womb control to My Trust Misha. We started waiting for the beautiful day to come, EDD March 13. Waiting\u2026waiting and waiting\u2026.\nThe day has come, Aashik started planning to arrive on 23rd Feb and I suppose to consult the doctor on 21st evening. I went there to the clinic, felt like a normal check-up. She started checking my BP; boom! It hit 160/100; suddenly she was so much worried and I saw her face, she called the receptionist and asked the other consultant to leave immediately. I and my mother has no clue what\u2019s happening around us. \nDoctor took me to the Anjaka Hospital on her own ride and on her own care. By the time my mom went home to adopt the situation. My BP was being monitored break free and same was informed to the Doctor. She said I can go home if BP goes down, if not we need to bring the beauty out. I was praying god to postpone the date at least for one more day, I want my labor partner to be with me to gaze the first sight of my baby together.  But seems my little princess can\u2019t wait for his dad to come; BP was on the same pace. So doctor decided to bring the little princes out.  I was confident enough and ready for the happiness, I felt painless thinking about the happiness forward. I saw full of freaked out faces around me, I was consoling everyone, and I thought they would do it to me. Aashik was literally crying over the phone and hardest thing was he couldn\u2019t get direct flight, haha.. Saturday night made his travel miserable. My dear Labour partner came after 8 hours, hitting 3 locations to see her new born.\nThe view! Approximately after 2 hours, I was on half sleep and drowsy, I heard a sweet little cry. Yes! It was first cry of my beauty. My Mom showed the beauty of sweet little face, I still can imagine, she was crying out loud, she was Pink. Her leg fingers and lengthy. Doctor was visiting me every day and keep calling the nurse to know me. I felt a real care in her. Thank you so much Doctor Misha Pepsi and she continuing to care me and my baby even after my discharge. Thanks for your great support\u2026\nWith Love and Respect\nNaafiya Aashik Ahamed and baby Arlin\n",

                "review_text": "Hi all, Thanking the almighty first of all for giving me grace to share my birth experience with Dr. Misha mam.\nGot Married & moved to this area in the month of May2019. Least knowing about the facility available in this locality, within 2 months we had to look for a gynae to confirm my pregnancy. Selva Maternity center was near my place so we just entered only to confirm my happiness. My first visit with Mam gave me high positivity, the way she addressed, the affirmative approach and her friendliness made me visit her again & again. With no doubt within our 2nd visit we confirmed that she is the one gonna be entrusted with my pregnancy.\nTo mention i\u2019m a person who is allergic or phobic to hospitals or doctors, i\u2019ve never felt anything of that sort with misha mam. It was all the concern, motivation and the right guidance that she bestowed.\nThe care provided by the doctor at each stage of pregnancy is mentionable. When i was in my 12th week I had complete dehydration, with lot of hesitation I had to call the doctor as it ws a sunday. The way she diagnosed & addressed half cured me & I ws surprised seeing a doctor taking utmost care even when she is not reachable.\nIn my 22nd week I had severe breathing problem, and mam was not in town at that time, in no doubt I felt her presence in her absence. Admist of her personal obligation she never failed her professionalism, with no time she made all the arrangements of an alternate doctor & treatment before I could reach the hospital & to my surprise her follow up at 12.30 in the night of how i\u2019m coping up made me mesmerized. Hats of to you mam!!\nI was in my full term pregnancy & was advices to get admitted in the hospital on 7th April, as the water level started dripping off. From then I saw a miraculous lady spinning around me every now and then continuously monitoring my progress. I was initially induced pain & was under observation for 12hrs within that for every 2hrs even in the midnight doctor was calling my husband to check on my status. I started having contraction early morning but I was dilated only 1 cm but still she waited . I was given IV & membrane rupture, pain increased but still it was only 2cm dilated in the late evening. To mention, her constant motivation on squats and other exercise was helping me to ease out the pain. In b/w baby\u2019s heart rate was continuously monitored & was updated fr every 1/2an hour. Being intolerant to pain I was continuously asking for epidural, knowing that would prolong my labour, Misha mam came out of her way to consider my request. When she sensed that we were panicking I can never forget the assurance that she gave to me and my husband from the Inception \u201cthe mother and baby are my responsibility\u201d she gave us full education of all the steps she was taking more than me Misha mam had great determination to have a normal delivery. In the labour room I still remember the words \u201cyou are a challenge to me Jasper\u201d I want to do a normal delivery for a person who is intolerant to pain and she did what she meant yes my cute little angel was born on 9th April2020  at 3:23 a.m. \n I am truly grateful and feeling blessed to have you entrusted with my pregnancy. Thank you so much Doctor. To all the mom\u2019s to be \u201cyou are in the right hands\u201d just do as she advices you and trust her completely. As she says \u201cyou and your baby will be safe\u201d and I really mean it!\n praying the almighty for good health and long life to you mam.",

I am very much thankful to Dr Misha Pepsi mam. without her this would not have been possible. I had mild labour from 1 am on 8th Sept and membrane rupture at around 3 am. since this is my 2nd pregnancy, I did not want to wait at home for a longer period. I went to the hospital at around 4.30 am. I was only 25% effaced and 2cm dilated. there was not much improvement in my labour.. it was a very slow process and meanwhile my water level was decreasing. I was constantly monitored for the baby's heartbeat and position. as and when I had pains there was a dip in the baby's heartbeat. that was because of a cord around his neck. around 4.30 PM misha mam told me that we shall induce since there was no much progress in the labour and the water level was also less. I was induced and pains were slightly higher, but the heartbeat was the same. there was a constant dip as and when I had pain. around 6.30pm, mam told me that she can neither risk the life of the baby nor mine, so let's go for c section if needed. she also said she will wait for another 2 hours, if there is not much progress then we will decide. I was shattered but that is when misha mam told me the facts and she also said \"we still have 2 hours of time, anything might happen, you keep doing squats and walking\". every minute I was closely monitored and encouraged. it was 7.30 and mam told me, this is ur final 30 mins. we will check after 30 mins if there is no progress then we will decide. but even then she encouraged me to stay strong and do my squats. it was 8 PM and I was 5 cm dilated. there was improvement so mam gave me another trump card of my life. another 30mins and I felt everything is falling in place. gained a little confidence. at 8.30 I was almost fully dilated but the head was not coming down, the pain was intense and the dip in the heartbeat continued. had there been any other doctor they would not have given me this time and chance, everyone was tensed but mam still had hope and she literally dragged me to the labour ward. she said no wheel chair and we went to the labour room running. it was 8.45pm and the final moments with misha mam and ramya mam.. they just said yamini push and only u can do it everything is in place. and by 9.05 PM my boy was in Misha mam' s hand. she was so much confident and did not want to take it to c section. the cord around the neck was cut even before my boy came out completely, that moment was unforgettable. I was the happiest person in the universe. Just a thanks would never be enough mam. Misha mam, you mean a lot to me. you have supported me throughout my pregnancies. Love u mam.",

I have been visiting the doctor right from the start of my pregnancy and I have delivered my baby vaginally only because of doctor's efforts and my post delivery recovery is also smooth. The best thing about the doctor is she is available round the clock over Whatsapp/calls to answer any queries which is highly commendable as not all doctors offer such services.  Will definitely recommend the doctor for all women and especially expectant mothers as the doctor never insists on C section unless or until it is absolutely required and guides through well from the start of pregnancy like starting antenatal classes at the right time which definitely help in delivery and recovery.

Dr. Misha Pepsi is truly exceptional.Dr. Misha Pepsi was not only patient but also incredibly helpful throughout my pregnancy. She took the time to address all my concerns, providing valuable information and guidance at every step.I had issues conceiving and had a previous abortion. In the first appointment, Doctor explained everything in detail and she took some tests and monitored my cycle. My periods were irregular and ovulated late. I was monitored every two days from day 11. After treatment, the next month, I conceived.At 8 weeks i had some bleeding issues and was diagnosed with subchorionic hemorrhage. But eventually the bleeding stopped after treatment. Doctor has helped with issues during pregnancy. She was always available via phone and whatsapp.I was mostly bedridden as it was high risk pregnancy.Around 32 weeks, doctor confirmed that everything is fine and she advised to take Antenatal classes. It was offered in the clinic itself. The class was excellent.One of the most remarkable things about Dr. Misha Pepsi was her commitment to my well-being. During the delivery process, when I was initially leaning towards a c-section due to my fears, she insisted on a normal delivery. Looking back, I'm grateful for her insistence as it resulted in a safe and smooth delivery.Doctor advised some exercises during labor and it had helped me for normal delivery.Due to issues during pregnancy, i was demotived and never thought that i would deliver a healthy baby via normal delivery. Every one in my family was shocked. Doctor motived me throughout my pregnancy.I recently moved to kochi and visited a doctor there, for post natal checkup. But i was not satisfied and eventually going back to chennai for check up. After visiting Selva maternity clinic, i didnt like to go to other clinics or hospitals.The nurse in the clinic was also very friendly and helpful.I highly recommend Selva Maternity Clinic and Dr. Misha Pepsi to any expectant mothers out there. The combination of her expertise, patience, and dedication to the well-being of both the mother and the baby is truly commendable.Thanks for making our lives better. My family is very grateful.We wish you and your family long and healthy life.",

Even after the delivery, She made sure she cared me well, visited me everyday, asked about my wellbeing, supported me and made sure everything was made available at our comfort.\nThanking you from the bottom of my heart for taking care of me, ensuring safe delivery of my Baby Boy, for encouraging me like my own family member when I was down thinking that I couldn't give birth via normal delivery and making sure we are healing completely. You are an inspiration who constantly strives to give only the Best along with your smile, for all who come to you seeking your guidance \nKeep inspiring us Dear Doctor!!\nThank you once again Doctor for giving us the trust and ensuring that we are in safe hands of you as we consider *** **** ** **** who help us give safe birth to both the Mother and the Baby!! \nI will definitely recommend Dr.Misha Pepsi for all the Mom-to-Be's especially for a positive pregnancy cum birth experience and parenting!!

She rushed to the hospital immediately..I was in labour pain for 3 hours and she was with me in the labour ward till i deliver the baby..for my first delivery, doctor came only 30 mins before the delivery...she was very supportive in the labour ward and encouraged me to do the exercises with the support of my husband.. she was keep on talking to me to make me conscious..and finally i had a normal delivery and my princess was born..I wanted to say big big thank you to Misha Pepsi mam for making my delivery easier and for the support you have given throughout my pregnancy...you are super gyno and I wish your great service to be  continued..",

Amidst those busy schedules and exhausting days, u never forget that cheerful smile on your face which invokes the confidence of each patient who undergoes labour. Even doctors are humans I still doubt how they can be so energetic dealing with each patient that too with a lot of patience... Literally I could realise the passion and love for the service you are doing....no words to explain that...In my daily prayers I have included you and your family to have a peaceful,healthy and happy life. You should live long and stay blessed to provide such a great service which is rarely found in this world...Thank you is a small word to express my gratitude but I don't find anything other than that...I have two daughters now..definitely I will show you to them for inspiration in their life... Thank you so much and Love you so much mam...\n\nWith lots of love...\nSharanya\ud83d\ude0a",

We are very proud to share our pregnancy story with you all.\nFor 3yrs we were trying for pregnancy and did a lot of treatments in a couple of hospitals but all went in vein.We totally lost all our hopes.\nBy that time coronavirus started so we thought to continue treatment in a nearby hospital and found Dr.Misha pepsi mam by god grace in June '20.\nIn the very first meet itself she provided a lot of hope and positive vibes.She went through our reports and guided a straight path to what she gonna follow for the next few months.\n\"\"She always gives us hope by sharing her very own pregnancy story with us\"\".She suggested D'LAP for us and told us that you guys will get conceive normally without any treatment.\nWe believed in her words always and blindly went through for D'LAP .She always suggests waiting for a normal pregnancy instead of IVF. Mams word came true we got conceived the very next month after LAP .\nThroughout my pregnancy she took good care & support. She will be always available to answer all my queries irrespective of any time.\nFrom day one we confirmed our pregnancy we went through a lot of struggles and obstacles. But she guided us in the proper way to continue our pregnancy in a healthy way.\nWithout mam's support we won't see this miracle happened in our life.There is lot more to say but words are not enough !!.\n\"We see GOD on Dr.Misha Pepsi Mam\". Thanks a lot Mam for bringing our life back with smile :). Wish you all success in ur life!!\n",

Since I reside nearby, I wanted to find an ob-gyn in and arnd Madipakkam, keelkattalai, Nanganallur. We were fortunate to have met Misha ma'am. \n\nWe delivered a baby girl on June 22nd - 40 weeks 1 day.. Here is our journey with Misha ma'am. I have pcos and auto immune thyroiditis and I had trouble in conceiving for first 3 years of marriage. We visited her and she nearly spent 1 hour to understand the history of us on our very first visit. She then explained clearly the line of treatment she is going to treat us. She took each and every step carefully for us to conceive soon. I used to ask many questions throughout and she always clears our doubts with a smiling face. She used to tell us, u need to ask questions and clear your doubts. It's your right.!\n\nI was induced with gel for 2 times on my due date since I don't have any symptoms of labor pain. But I was dilated only 1 cm even after 2 times and there was no progress. But ma'am was ready to wait and induce another time, Meanwhile baby's heart rate became abnormal and we decided to go for emergency C section. It was an informed decision and on each step she explained pros and cons to us clearly. And we were able to accept the decision we took as baby's health was the utmost priority.\n\nI Personally have to say this. After delivery, she keeps checking on all her patients on daily basis. She regularly comes for visits to our room itself every morning and evening and we can also contact her thro phone if anything urgent or emergency. I was very much down for not able to feed my baby effectively due to flat nipple issue, seeing my eyes she enquired what's the problem and she guided me how to feed the baby and educated me on positions also. She always goes extra step to care for her patients and thier babies. She even advised me to be strong and assured me it's normal to have this depressed feeling right after delivery. \n\nWe liked below points, \nTransparency of treatment given, doctors availability 24*7, prescribing medicines for necessary conditions, avoiding unnecessary medication, doctors friendliness. I felt comfortable seeing her. We highly recommend her. \ud83d\ude0a \n\nWe thank you so much Misha ma'am for the positivity you have created in our lives. You have showed us there will be definitely a light at end of a tunnel. \ud83d\ude0a\n",

But all we can say is that, Dr. Misha Pepsi is the sole reason behind our happiness.We were at the middle of uncertainties regarding the future of our parental life. Medical history was highlighted by pcod, 9th week miscarriage and non-conceivement.   But the ray of hope began after the first consultation with Dr. Misha Pepsi. We had experienced systematic approach for diagnosis and care. It started with assessing biomarkers to find out what is wrong inside and initiated medications. Very soon we have witnessed the good news, but there started the real challenge.Pregnancy was accompanied by early hyper BP, short cervical length, IUGR and inborn Rh-ve issue. Combination of these things was a clear hazard to our child and mother. These kinds of complications will always make the job hard for a doctor. But the professional skill and dedication of Dr. Misha Pepsi helped us to overcome these hurdles. Timely and accurate medical follow-ups (including cervical cerclage) by the doctor was the real-life saving measures. Each situation was explained in a gentle way and always tried to make us calm and stay positive. There were multiple times we have experienced the dedicated care of Dr. Misha Pepsi.Today we are parents, and that is solely because of Dr. Misha. While looking back at the complications, her role was truly a savior. Now our parenthood can be considered as a living evidence for the professional commitment and care of Dr. Misha Pepsi.  From our experience we truly believe that Dr. Misha Pepsi is a rightful choice for any couple who wants to be parentsFinally, all we can say is a big thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

In the 1st visit itself Doctor gave us good news by confirming my pregnancy. And she also analyzed the complete medical condition of mine based on that she started the treatment and suggested the tablets to follow. Regularly she will be available for all our doubts via WhatsApp also. During my last few weeks of pregnancy term when we visited doctor for regular check up she told my BP is slightly high and unstable and my water level also in the border line and asked me to get admitted in Anjakha Hospital immediately. But unfortunately Dr. Misha couldn't attend my delivery based on her some personal emergency but she informed required people in hospital for my delivery and also she constantly followed up with them for the status during her emergency situation too. She told us not to worry and I will be in safe hands. We believed Misha words completely. By God's grace we are blessed with Boy Baby on 28th April 2021. Misha was in constant touch in phone call whenever required until my discharge from hospital. Post delivery also she clears all our doubts via WhatsApp. We are really mesmerized by her passion & service she is contributing to all. She is a real diamond. Thank you Dr. Misha Pepsi for all the love and care you shower upon us. We wish you to continue this service to the society always. God Bless you immensely & wish you all the luck that you deserve. Thank you mam once again. I Love You. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

Since 3 yrs we were trying for pregnancy... At last got conceived by Aug 2019... I have went checkup in someother hospital... But they told me that baby growth is not good... We lost our hopes... At that time i came to know about misha mam through practo... She gave me positive vibes from the first meet itself. She told me that the baby growth is not good... If i have came earlier to misha mam surely she would have saved my first child... After that she listened to my problems and told me the treatment that she is going to follow... She told me to take rest for 6months.. After that in Jan 2021 i went to her for treatment... By gods grace and misha mam treatment i got conceived in August 2020.. Throughout my pregnancy period she took good care of me... She will be always there for queries... sShe explained each and everything to me and my husband... During my labour she keeps on monitoring... She motivated me and also told my family members to encourage me... though this is my first pregnancy my in laws forced me to come to native. But me and my husband  and my mom decided to stay here to deliver our baby from misha mam's hand... Whether its day or night she will be available during emergency... Till my discharge she keeps on monitoring me and baby...  I think no doctor would take care of her patient like misha mam...  Still now my mom wishing misha mam to have good health and long life... I pray to god that she must continue her service for decades... Thank you sooo much mam and thank god for letting me know about misha mam.. Love you sooo much mam... ",

I came across doctor's profile in practo with so many good reviews. With full of hope I started my treatment with Dr.Misha mam. From the very first time she has been very friendly and has taken great care of my health on all my routine check-ups. Not only she listens to all my concerns and doubts but also very patiently explains about it. Even when I felt low health-wise doctor always built up my confidence and says \"you and your baby are important to me\". That has always boosted me up. During my 37th week I suddenly got nagging pain with spotting. Informing doctor about this she immediately asked me to get admitted and on examining doctor suspected if the baby would have passed meconium stool. Still she encouraged me to try for normal delivery and kept tracking FHR. Though we kept trying for normal delivery with continuous nagging pain for two days, I was totally drained out when I was induced. With no energy to bear pain anymore finally I insisted for C-section. As suspected by doctor baby had passed stool but with God's grace and doctor's help I safely delivered baby boy on October 24th. I feel so happy on finding such a great doctor who is down to earth providing the best treatment and care to her patients. I pray the almighty to bless doctor and her family that she continues to give the bestest medical practice throughout. Thanks Dr.Misha mam \ud83d\ude0a",

I got married and moved to Chennai by end of 2018,would like to share my experience on Selva maternity centre.Being new to the place, it's hard to find a Hospital/Clinic around with proper Facility around.To confirm my pregnancy we were Searching in Practo for doctors around and going through every reviews, luckily we came across Dr.Misha Pepsi mam's profile, was stunned to see such positive reviews and immediately decided to visit her.Our first visit was on 17 Dec, While waiting we were attracted to the board filled with letters. It was so amazing to see the experience and feedback from so many monthers while waiting there. Honestly I have never seen such positivity and life-changing experiences. Misha mam checked me and confirmed my pregnancy. She explained everything clearly and guided on how to be and what to follow during this phase. We visited her for the monthly check ups and every visit clearly shows why ppl prefer to visit such a patient friendly and always approachable doctor. Unlike many others I noticed Misha mam spends enough quality time with each patient and addressing all the queries instead of rushing.We can blindly follow what she suggests and prescribes as her approach is more practical and person based.Things were good until covid hit the city, we couldn't visit the centre for check ups, yet Misha mam was always approachable on phone(WhatsApp) and guided for the tests to be taken in near centres and reviewing the results.Due to rising covid cases we were forced to plan the delivery at hometown, I left Chennai in May 2020 and was blessed with a Prince on July 30, it was a Normal delivery and baby was healthy too.once again thanks a lot Misha mam!",

I had my first miscarriage at 5 weeks in March, 2019. After that I conceived again in  June, 2019 and I started consulting Dr. Misha. My pregnancy was a high risk one and she took  a really great care of me through out the pregnancy. I had cervical incompetency and had to take stitches during 6th month. I was in tension but Misha mam gave me assurance that I should not worry and she told that your child is precious to me and its my responsibility, you just dont worry and stay happy. Once, i started bleeding and got admitted again. So overall I got admitted 3 times before delivery and Misha mam was a great support all the times. Finally at 33 weeks and 5 days, my pain started. It started around 12 pm and we rushed to hospital, and we all wanted normal delivery, so we waited till night. Dr. Misha was there with me all the time and giving me strength along with my husband. She also wanted normal delivery and waited till night. Finally I delivered my princess at 12.25 am and she was premature, she needed immediate attention, she was moved to another children's hospital and Dr. Misha was in constant touch with pediatrician  whole night. She didn't even sleep and she was in hospital only till morning 6 am. She left the hospital only after confirmation that mom and baby are safe.  Mam, thank you so much for all your support and raking really good care of me during pregnancy. I strongly recommend her for normal delivery and her very caring nature. ",

                "review_text": "Pregnancy is a wonderful period to be relished in one's lifetime. A period filled with excitement coupled with  fear and anxieties at times ,as d experience varies with women.\nThis period is made even more beautiful and memorable with the near and dear ones. One such is d gyno whom we choose. After d missed periods it would be a tough job to find a 'good gyno 'as the choices would be many made upon d experience, approach, proximity etc etc... I didn't have d confusion to choose one because Dr.Misha is a fellow Dominican, my schoolmate who was my senior and I used to call her  sister.\nWell Connected and came to know her service through fb, was following all her posts too....I consulted her  before marriage everything was fine  except for a small hormonal change.\n Every doc is unique,she has her own style of attending d patients with  her mesmerizing talk and smile.A caring attitude and approchability  spotted a difference . I felt dat I was in  my 'comfort zone'. Dats wat made me to decide and  chose her to handle my pregrancy eventhough her clinic was quite far.\n\nI was in my advanced maternity age so I was worried .With every visit all my worries faded. I was  very particular to have a normal delivery .With her advise and confidence given I was able to handle my preggy well. I was suggested to   join pregnancy classes tutored my Kavitha Venkatesan ma'am. A special note of thanks to Kavitha ma'am whose classes were really informative , helpful and that would be an added advantage in making one self active during anti and post  pregnancy period. It was a stress buster for a working woman like me esp those dances are to be highlighted.\n\n1..2...3..here we go it was like a roller coaster ride and there I was in my last month of preggy waiting for my lil one. I was on work even though my due date was approaching quite near. With a week's time ahead I had my amniotic sac broken and was admitted in d hospital.\nDr. Misha was constantly monitoring me and my baby, from morning 7 o clock .With every delivery case hoping for a normal one ,she tried her best to make mine  normal.Her assurance saying' with no compromise in both baby's and mother's  health I would wait and go for a normal delivery ' was a booster to me. The child's heart beat was monitored at regular intervals. All the efforts were futile even after  inducing pain  ..the water level was also monitored as it was being reduced. My lil one's heart beat was quite flat and was not satisfactory in d evening as d water level was reduced. I wanted to taste and  experience d  labour pain \nBut god's plan was different for me.I was operated at 7 in d late evening cos baby's head didn't engage and ther was no signs of labour pain.\nWith a heavy heart I was operated . But my worries disappeared like dew d very minute I saw my replica...yeah it was' junior shanthi' ...\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\n\nKudos to Dr.Misha who was made my pregrancy journey a beautiful one..\n\nFor all the expectant moms you would b safe in  Dr.Misha's hands.\n \nAnd thus d curtain closes \"With a Dominican delivering  a fellow Dominican\".\n\nPS: It's a late story cos am in parenting mode yaar\ud83e\udd17",

I have been visiting the doctor right from the start of my pregnancy and I have delivered my baby vaginally only because of doctor's efforts and my post delivery recovery is also smooth. The best thing about the doctor is she is available round the clock over Whatsapp/calls to answer any queries which is highly commendable as not all doctors offer such services.  Will definitely recommend the doctor for all women and especially expectant mothers as the doctor never insists on C section unless or until it is absolutely required and guides through well from the start of pregnancy like starting antenatal classes at the right time which definitely help in delivery and recovery.

Once I came to know that I was pregnant she was our go to person. \nPregnancy Journey\nThroughout my pregnancy I had few hiccups and Misha mam was there like a guardian angel to guide us. Right from referring to another stream doctor for a second opinion and giving me the confidence, I needed to carry out my pregnancy journey peaceful.\nLabour Journey\nMisha mam right from the starting of the pregnancy she always encouraged to do lot of activities and ensured for natural birth. But I had to go emergency C section delivery, since the baby heartbeat started going down, I was so sacred but mam was there and explained what is the process included and even in the OT she spread her magic positive aura by putting songs to relax my mind and handed my son to me which is a surreal feeling given by Misha Mam forever grateful for that. Her OT team is the best in all means.\nPost OP Recovery \nPost the operation she made sure I was recovering at a good speed and health. She also made sure I had to do the Post OP 6-week check-up which is very important because a \u201chappy and healthy mother gives a healthy baby\u2019\u2019. \nAlways and forever grateful for this beautiful pregnancy journey to Misha Mam.\n",

From the first day, she took immense care in making me comfortable, hearing my doubts and clarifying them clearly. She made us aware of the important things to pay attention to during pregnancy and helped me get over the problems I had in this journey. The guidance that she gave helped me a lot to get over my fears and bring my little angel into this world. My delivery was during midnight and even in those late hours she showed immense dedication, calmness and affection to me. My labor started at 10.30 pm. After hours of struggle, I became exhausted, gave up on myself and I asked for C- Section. But she didn't give up on me even for a single second. She trusted me to make a normal delivery and motivated me to do it. She waited a long time, put in a lot of effort and made me deliver my baby girl at 3.30 am as a normal delivery. There were many complications but she tackled all those things excellently. I'm very grateful to her for helping me, supporting me and delivering our bundle of joy.",

I wished to go for VBAC ,she supported me in all ways she guided me throughout the journey.On dec'18 th , early morning pain started i was observing whether it's false pain or true one ..As time goes on pain started to increase ,i called mam and went to hospital she came and checked and got admitted immediately , throughout the day i was in labour she checked me often and monitored baby's health . Evening the pain was intense but my labour was too slow and i opted for C -Section that night .In OT mam said one word that I don't regret  for doing C-section ,since my previous scar was week due to labour pain and my baby had passed meconium . Timely decision matters ,i too never regret for opting c section in last minute .After delivery ,she visited often until the day of discharge.And till now she is guiding in all ways when I call her or visit her.Great human soul she is,I would highly recommend her for pregnancy checkups and delivery \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a",

As we recently celebrated my son\u2019s first bday, thought this would be the perfect time to share my happy pregnancy and delivery experience. I always wanted to thank the angel (Misha mam) who brought my son into this world. I got pregnant in US and came back to India when I was 4 months due to home sick and other reasons. Me and my husband was searching for a gynecologist close by my area where we came across Misha mam with very good review. During the first visit itself, I felt I was lucky to meet her becoz of her confidence and motivation. Everything went good and she took atmost care of me and baby. She never hesitated to answer the calls during odd hours and if we didn\u2019t give her call back, she will follow up on the situation. She tried her best to deliver my baby normally but due to decrease in heartbeat level and cord twisted around the baby neck, it happened to be cesarean. After couple of months, same situation happened to one of my friend\u2019s cousin where doctor delayed and they couldn\u2019t save the baby. At that moment, I thanked Misha mam zillion times for her timely action. Irrespective about the mode of delivery, I am now back to my normal life because of her motivation and able to do all the work. Now my son started called me with the most beautiful word \u2018AMMA\u2019 and thank you Misha mam for giving me this precious gift.  \n",

Based on our medical history/age factor  Ma'am suggested to undergo basic fertility evaluation test. Was diagnosed with low AMH level. Clear explanation on the issue was provided by Ma'am which helped us to proceed with the next steps. \nInitially started with follicular study and later we proceeded for IUI which was failure. \nWe were given option to choose IVF procedure with clear explanation on the process , what to expect in the procedure.  Ample time was given for us to mentally prepare for the procedure and we started the IVF treatment on October. \nDue to utmost care provided by Ma'am (Considering my existing health issues) , I was able to conceive on the first IVF transfer itself on November. She was always there for any queries and support at anytime (even in midnight) and helped us on our successful pregnancy journey. \nWe were blessed with baby boy this month due to God Grace in form of Misha ma'am. We are forever indebted to Ma'am. Thank you ma'am - Geetha",

She listens to me completely, understand the issues & guided me in a very correct channel. My aminotic fluid started leaking @ week 32. She immediately admitted me to the hospital & explained the situation to us in a very clear manner. I underwent a C section delivery. She was available 24/7. Due to various medical complications I was not been able to treat with antibiotics. So, c section wound started producing puse. She took intense care on me... made daily dressing & then done re-stiching. Those days were really painful, both physically & mentally. Dr Misha gave positive words to make me feel healthy. Morethan a Dr she is such a good human & makes us to feel like that we are with a friend. Pregnancy is a Great thing in every women's life. In such times, we need a proper guidance, advisor & care taker. For those women I strongly suggest Dr Misha. U can blindly trust her, u ll feel comfort & safe under her arms. Thank you Dr for all ur assistance & care. Keep this good work going. \ud83d\udc4f \n\n",

We never looked to change or look for any doctor as everybody said it will be caesarion. \n\nBut then one of my friend suggested to consult Dr Misha Pepsi and my wife was 7 months pregnant. The first visit gave us the confident that she can try for normal (VBAC) and then we decided that she is our doctor for the remaining period. \n\nMy wife did all the exercise which we suggested and the results were showing positivity when we met the doctor every month / week until the delivery.  It was nearly her due date and the doctor was in no hurry and she waited for normal pain to try her level best. We waited , waited and waited but the baby's head never came down and we finally hard to go for Caesarion. \n\nEnd result (Normal or C section) was not a factor but the effort and comfort that you get from Misha Pepsi is highly incredible. \n\nJust before the day of delivery - she stayed with us in hospital anticipating pain anytime which I believe no doctors would do. She was with us for whole night until 9am next day before the baby was born. \n\nShe kept following up every hour and was monitoring my wife regularly. After 6 months my wife did contacted her through whatsapp for gynac related illness and she was following up until she got to know my wife is back to normal. \n\nShe is such a gift and great doctor. *** ********* ** ******* *** ** ************ ******** ",

Misha mam promised to my mom that next one will definitely be full term baby. Yes! As she promised I delivered Baby Boy on May28th with all the support and timely treatment by her.\n\nThrough out my pregnancy journey, I\u2019ve bugged her with my silly doubts and fear but she comforted me and provided confidence every time. During my 4th month, I had a light blood discharge and it was late Sunday evening. I just dropped her a msg in WhatsApp. In next 20mins, she was there at the clinic for me. Any time and any emergency she was always available for us. It was nice experience to allow my husband to be part of labor. I could feel our bonding got increased more right from that moment. Thanks for giving that moment mam.\n\nMisha mam is super energetic person who runs all the day just for her patients. I always admire her love for her profession. To my eyes, she is always a Wonder women, warrior and singapenne \ud83d\ude0d\nI would like to thank her family for being so supportive for her profession and thank you mam for all you are doing. I am so glad to have you. We wish you and your family a healthy life \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWith love\nArthi",

We would like to share our pregnancy experience with Mam. Initially, we strongly decided that we will consult the same Doctor through out pregnancy and we chose Dr.Misha mam by going through her positive google and practo reviews. From the day1 when we confirmed our pregnancy till the birth of our child, Mam took great care and was available anytime for all the serious and silly doubts that we had during the journey. Anyone who visits mam will immediately take in the positivity that she exhibits all the time. The 40 weeks of pregnancy with routine check ups, scans, tests and exercise with Mams advise was a pure bliss. On the D day, it was decided to be a C-section as our child was too active and it was a mobile head case. Mam handed over our bundle of joy with great care to us and also constantly monitored my progress and health after the surgery. She ensured my progress through visits in the hospital which is usual but also through early morning calls. Overall it was a very positive and happy pregnancy with such a kind and responsible consultant that we got. Thanks a lot once again, Dr.Misha mam.",

When we visited for first time we got more positive vibes she is very polite and brave. She started to take care of my health and my baby. Through out my pregnancy she has taken good care. She will be always available for my queries, time doesn't matter. During my labour she guided me very well and keep on monitoring. I don't think no doctor would take care like her. A good mother's aim is, the baby shoud come to the world with good health. Whether it is normal or cesarean the baby and mom should be good. Like this she advised my family and me. So we got hope. Atlast my baby doll came out in a good manner. I should thank misha mam Till my discharge from the hospital she took good care and keep on monitoring my health condition and baby's too. I pray to god that she should continue her service with good health for all decades.she Is very unique in her profession...I wish her  service to be continued and reach peaks and peak ....thankyou so much for your concern mam\ud83d\ude0d",

I was suffering from irregular periods for the past 1 year and haven\u2019t undergone any treatment considering covid stress and situation. \nWe always postpone our health issues either due to ignorance or the fact that we are not ready to face it. \nOn one fine evening after prior appointment, i met Dr.Misha maam for the first time at Selva Maternity Clinic located at Madipakam. I went inside with anxiousness and pressure about what could have possibly gone wrong with me. But I got a sense of relief when she calmly heard to my entire history and went through all my blood reports, explaining me step by step about how to go with the treatment plan, reassuring and sowing the seed of belief in me. She is a warm hearted, compassionate and a confident doctor. This is not my review. This is my heartfelt experience with Dr.Misha and promising myself that she will be the one and only Gynaecologist to whom i will completely reply on with regards to my health. Thankyou very much maam. As a doctor myself, you are my inspiration.",

I am highly recommending Misha Mam.Here is our story.\nWe were new to Chennai when my wife was pregnant. We have not known where to go for checkup. After i searched multiple doctors in online then I found a highly positive reviews for one Doctor that is Misha mam. Without any second thought we went to her.After the first check up we decided we should not worry about anything in the whole pregnancy period because Misha mam is there. That kind of confidence we got in the first check up itself. Then we regularly went to check up and we got all the doubts cleared in the layman language.She have cleared each and every step in a simple manner. She is easily accessible.Unfortunately we have not completed our full pregnancy period in Misha mam's hand.We went to our hometown and locked because of COVID19. Even then also we have called regularly and she had given prescription in the call itself.We continued all the tablets in the whole pregnancy period.At last My son born before 1 month from due date without any complications. He is totally healthy.\nNow also we have called and gets our doubts cleared regarding vaccination.\nWe are highly recommending the Madam.If you have chance please book an appointment without any second thought..One of the best Doctor in Chennai.\n\nThanks,\nVijayakumar-Mohanapriya.",

I am blessed with baby girl \ud83e\udd31\ud83c\udffbthrough normal delivery 2 days back.. ..i was just 38 kgs when I came to know am pregnant \ud83e\udd30 .. Even myself and my husband asked you is it possible to bear a kid with this weight. You encouraged us why is it not possible? and now with 55kgs never thought I would deliver normally... It was you who made it happen... From my first visit I saw more motivation and encouragement from your end..Thrice I had bleeding in first 5 months...Even had PUPPS on the 9th month.. You were the one who treated me to over come all those hurdles and further until delivery...I received positive energy from your end every time we met you.. Whenever I called you for some issue u gave clear advices and you used to call back to follow up.. I feel so great about you on it... On the delivery day you came for me at night  took utmost care and made to do exercise, motivated, encouraged, made me feel positivity around that I can do and delivered normally... I think the exact labour was just 1 hour  which is very very less and its all because of only you.. Only your motivation made it happen soon.. All my friends and relatives are surprised that I delivered normally that too within short period of time.. ..Thanks a lot doctor... I can tell you infinity thanks.. . \ud83e\udd70Love you so much doctor \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18am feeling so lucky to be your patient..\n\n",

It's a Sunday when we have taken the home test to confirm pregnancy and when called the nearby clinics to confirm the same, Misha mam was the first one to say congratulations to us \u2764\ufe0f back then we didn't knew it was her. Later we searched doctors through practo and visited her. Her welcoming smile, explanations, doubt clarifications, taking time with the patients patiently boosts us and gave us the complete confidence. I personally am one who always prefers to get a second opinion would never felt the way and was completely able to trust Misha mam from the very first visit. She was there through out whenever we need her. Once my pressure went down in 9th month, a whole night she was constantly monitoring it every hour and made sure myself and baby is fine. She tries maximum for normal delivery and in my case due to non progress labour I had to prefer c sec which was very well explained to me and I chose it due to the high risk since it's past due and based on other medical conditions of the baby. I gave birth to a baby boy on June 18th \u2764\ufe0fand I can't thank Misha mam enough for keeping myself and baby safe. She motivated me to walk on the same day and she was constantly visiting and monitoring our health. My husband and I were very happy for preferring Misha mam. Pls continue ur greatest service to the society mam.All the very best and thank you so much from myself and my husband for right suggestions at the right time and by giving us the greatest gift of our life \u2764\ufe0f",

I don't know how to express my gratitude to someone like you who actually gave meaning to my life. I am very glad to share my pregnancy experience. Almost 5 years of our married life, myself and my husband are worried about baby. We have faced lots of criticism in this society. I have seen nearly 4 abortions.We people don't know the reasons of getting abortions continuously. We have met several doctors no one gave  us a permanent solution ,but you did it mam,I  saw your appointment in practo and also one of my cousin referred you. the same name MISHA..Still I remember the day, my last (4th) DNC was done by you. You just simply find the reasons of getting abortions and given the solutions for us. You advised me to put the fragment injections on daily basis Based upon baby growth you suggest me the dosage. Even though my pregnancy was complicated when compare to others. But you done a great achievement in our life mam. Thanks for easing my pain and thank you encouraging me when I was down. You helped me move on my pregnancy through motivational speech and inspirational thoughts. You have done what medicine along the would have not done. Continue to be a blessing to others through your profession.It's my goodness you have such a great gynecologist like you. God could not be everywhere she made sure that we have doctors like you who have the gift of healing mankind. Your wonderful treatment and loving care have given identity to my life. You deserve my heart full thanks. May the Lord shower his blessings to you and your family.",

I apologize if this message is too long.But I could'nt contain myself from sharing my story.\nMy due date was actually next month on October 4th.But as I approached the 38th week I started feeling very uneasy. I got false labour pains on and off .My baby's movements where also very less towards 38 weeks.And since my husband works abroad I have very less support most of the time.Was a bit stressed. Hence on 23rd morning I discussed this with Dr.Misha and we came to a conclusion that Its better to go in for a c-section. Dr.Misha told me it would be the right decision instead of waiting too long as my babys head had'nt got fixed in the cephalic position. \nBy evening around 4pm I was taken into the OT and Dr. Misha and team made sure everything went so painlessly. Nor the spinal anesthesia or the incision hurt. As they laid the incision, it is said my babys head was in transverse position and the umblical cord was entwined three times around her which made the operation a challenging one.But Dr.Misha with her expertise handled it so well. My baby did not cry till 5 mins after birth, but later she did. God bless, she is very healthy. Im so grateful to Dr.Misha for each and everything .\nBut most of all Im grateful to her because she got be walking and moving around the very next day after the operation. Which seemed impossible at that time.Instead of being in the hospital for 3-4days after c-section, I was discharged in 2 days.

She asked us which song wants to play in labor ward, Finally played \\\"Kandha sasti kavasam\\\" and Pepsi mam was talking casually and delivered boy baby without much pain. We can easily approach her thru whatsapp \\/phone. She encouraged to take healthy Foods(tender coconut, nuts, non-veg item's ) instead of unnecessary medicine's. After delivery also, she followed up very well... Even she did final dressing (usually Doctor will not do). We recommend her for others to get benefit.\\n\\n We wish, Dr Misha pepsi mam get good health& wealth and continue her service through out her life\\n\\n       \\\" Vazhga Valamudan Dr. Misha Pepsi mam and her service \\",

She reviewed all the reports and explained the possible approaches like Follicular study, Lapro..etc to proceed further. We were fully satisfied with her explanation and followed the same. Post Laparoscopic, within 4 months of time, we had a good news and during the pregnancy period as well Misha mam took much care on me like a mother. Finally a week before, we are blessed with a boy baby. Thanks to Misha mam & her team for their caring support during my pregnancy period. I would strongly recommend her those who are in need.

Mam is very explanatory, caring & jovial. Delivery date was expected to be in Nov'23. But on 16th Oct'23, Mam advised us to take the\u00a0 growth scan for second time as the previous report was not correct. Upon the new report, Mam advised to immediately admit as the baby's growth is in two weeks lag. I got admitted in hospital and labour was about to happen in the mid morning of the next day. I wasn't getting the labour pain and Mam confronted me to be confident and put some effort in delivering the baby. As it is a painful process. We are very grateful to Mam. She is dedicated, supportive, helpful and wellwisher. Thank you so much Mam \ud83d\ude07\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f!!!",

With the help of mam's advice and guidance,  and on obeying her words strictly,  it was possible  for me to achieve it. She took immense care and very much available on call/whatsapp always for any kind of doubts. Without Misha madam i would say this is not at all possible in my life. A heartfelt very big THANKS to her from me and my whole family for her service \ud83d\ude4f which has some personal touch in it that you cannot get from any other gynaec. I know thanks could be a very small word in front of the care/treatment she provided me during the labor time. She stayed that night in the Anjakha hospital which i could never forget. I always pray for her good health and to continue her service for the people.  Lots of Love from Rubini & Family \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764",

Doctor took all precautionary steps in each stages of my pregnancy to rule out any complications since mine was high risk pregnancy and more importantly, doctor is available through whatsapp 24x7, which make approching her way more easier.I vouch Dr. Misha for any one with any issues in conceiving. As the one who has witnessed her treatment, I strongly believe that with her nuances and perseverance, she will accomplish her patient's purpose of visit. We will be perpetually thankful to Dr. Misha. Regards,Suganya Ramprasad",

She guided me and kept my confidence level high throughout the pregnancy inspite of the complications that I had and helped deliver a healthy baby. Her friendly and approachable nature, the care and dedication that she shows, the energy and optimism that she exhibits and her ever smiling kind gesture is what makes her the must have doctor for every mother-to-bes. She is an amazing person and I highly recommend her. Selva Maternity Centre is a journey worth experiencing. Thank you so much Doctor!",

After few weeks i took my mom to her clinic as she was going through her menopause stage... From then she became almost like our family doctor..  I have never seen a doctor who is so understanding loving and caring. She is such a selfless person. After my mom i went to her for my checkups and pregnancy. During the entire pregnancy phase the motivation and the energy that she gave me can not be explained by words.\n I also delivered my beautiful princess recently. Inspite of her hectic week and tiresome schedule She kept on monitoring me on an hourly basis and had a sleepless night. I am forever grateful to her and to God for blessing me with an opportunity to meet her.",

I underwent follicular study and got conceived on the first phase itself. A big thanks to Dr. Misha mam! During the pregnancy time , she took complete care of myself by suggesting a good diabetic doctor to keep my sugar levels in control and was always available whenever we needed her. She was trying normal delivery for me but due to sugar and PIH , underwent a C Section delivery. During the previous night of the delivery date , she visited us and gave confidence , asked me not to fear. With Dr. Misha mam's guidance , help and positive approach ,  I am blessed with baby boy on May 18th. A big heartfelt thank you to Dr. Misha mam for this.",

Since the first visit experience we are glad we chose the right doctor.  She was friendly and explained everything in a way layman can understand, gave proper guidance right until delivery.  Unfortunately we had to travel to coimbatore at the end of 7th month and we went to another doctor in coimbatore for check up.  But even then we reached out to Misha mam for all my silly doubts and not even once she hesitated to help out and she cleared my doubts and made me more confident during delivery time.  I would recommend you to all my friends.  May god bless you with everything.  You are a \ud83d\udc8e GEM",

Then she guided to do exercise. During my 37th week,my water broke   she monitored my baby through nst hourly once even during night. \n\n\n I think no doctor will take an extra effort to wait for normal delivery. She waited for more than 24 hrs but since baby heart baby was increasing  she had to plan for c section.After delivery she continously monitored me and baby.There was a situation in the hospital where mam took am extra effort during late night where she instructed nurses to give proper medicine.We are very grateful to Misha mam.We pray she should continue her service and god  bless her family.Thank you so much mam\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90",

I was so uncontrollable during the  time of labour and myself asked her to go for c section but  she consoled me in all way saying that your labour will progress and forced me to go for a vaginal delivery she was   so kind and responded me well  and helped me to go for vaginal delivery ...finally I got a baby boy on 11/2/2021 from dr.mishamam's hand ...she Is very unique in her profession...I wish her  service to be continued and reach peaks and peak ....thankyou so much for your concern mam\ud83d\ude0d",

The way how she encouraged us makes more comfortable staying here for delivery rather than going to hometown.She is very much concerned about  patients , kindhearted and very much friendly too.

What a doctor she is, moreover she was not a doctor to me at any point of time, she was like my sister.. Caring, self motivating, loving. When I met her first time i got confident that i can make it. Words are more powerful than any other things in this world. She created new energy inside me. After 4.5 years of marriage life I met dr Misha and within in 6 months I got conceived normally with her treatment and encouragement.. She is such an amazing and wonderful human being. Last Sunday I gave birth to a cute baby boy and it was possible only because of Dr Misha. Doctor thanks a lot once again you are something special to me always.. I never seen any doctor in my life who is so much easily approachable..",

She s more than a doctor I would say right from day 1 she took utmost care and mentored throughout pregnancy , Explaining each and every minute detail which helped in educating myself through the term. Encouraging partner to be active participant had given us great moral support. I had a normal delivery which I didn't thought I would be able to do.. it's purely because of her encouragement & guidance.. Even after delivery her care and support has made me stable. Thank you so much Doctor for being amazing ",

Easy to reach her thats one of the special thing. Even reports she will jus ask to send through whatsapp itself and she would reply. She will not make you to come to clinic jus for report sake. I jus chose her randomly bcos there was doctor's strike going on but she was too good that I didn't change my doctor. Thank god I found a good doctor and thanks to Misha mam for making my pregnancy journey wonderful.",

She did exact same things as discussed. She took extreme care during pregnancy. She is like God to me, who gave me our second child. We had a long dream of having another child, Misha Mam fulfilled our dreams. I salute her eagerness to help her patients and be in constant touch with them even during such risky crisis. She is a hero. She took wonderful care of me even after childbirth and ensured speedy recovery. Thank you doctor for your wonderful care.  Gratitude \u2763\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f",

Your kindness, sincere caring, guidance and concern made everything positive and my dream became true now!!\nDr. Misha as a person is very positive, never gives false hopes however shares all the possible ways of becoming pregnant and she is very much skilled at what she does!\n\nShe takes time to listen and made me feel valued and respected and she goes by her instinct which always turns out to be positive for the patients.\nI always felt like I get plenty of time to explain my issues without feeling rushed. I am privileged to have you as my Doctor. Words cannot describe how grateful I am for you. Thank you for taking such great care of me!! \n",

My husband got to know about Dr. Misha Pepsi from internet and we reached out to her. The very first day itself, she was very patient enough to listen to my concerns, to know about my health issues etc. She patiently explained us about the process and follicular study which she was going to take me through for my pregnancy. Every visit with the doctor was so informative and helpful to understand what is happening within my body and she also gives us better options to go for during the process. Finally today I am pregnant by following all the prescribed medication and other important tips. Me and my husband are very glad and thankful that we got to visit Dr. Misha Pepsi. She is very positive, friendly and approachable doctor I have ever met. Thank you doctor for being there for us:)",

She gave me lot of hope and positive energy.she  explained clearly about my health condition. And gave me a  treatment with care and love.  This year I conceived  with a healthy baby.  Without misha mam it is impossible, whenever we went to hospital,  we feel the positive vibes from misha mam with smile . That gave  lot of energy to me and my husband.  She told about her pregnancy story  to get rid of my fear.  I have ever seen such a friendly lovable caring doctor  in my life. In mid of my pregnancy  I had depression,  I struggled a lot. I share everything to misha mam. Like a friend she told me whenever u feel alone or depressed  call me. I am always here for u. Like that she said... her words healed me. Due to some reason I went to my home town for.delivery . Eventhough  I am in native place  she cleared all my doubts through phone. We are so blessed to have such a dedicated doctor. Now I am blessed with a boy baby on oct 31st ... thanks a lot mam..  \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb. God has sent u for us.

My cousin said about Misha mam by seen such a good reviews... Misha mam confirmed my pregnancy 40 days baby growth ... From the starting itself she started talking very caring... Then I went all the regular check ups with her... She is available to clear all my doubts even at midnight... From 3rd month scan I have placenta previa. Everyone said that it will lead to definitely c section. But Misha mam said to take complete rest. I was in complete rest for 8 months. In 8th month scan there is no placenta previa. Then mam said me to do some exercise.  She never used any negative words. When I talk to Misha mam it's surrounded with complete positive vibes. At last my water breaks, Misha mam waited very patiently, Baby head also not moved down, one cord around my baby neck. I thought it will be c section but she said I will not do c section, will wait for normal delivery. Finally April 5th evening I am blessed with Baby boy through normal delivery... I Thank Misha mam for her guidance and support. We pray God to give her all the wealth and health to continue this great service... Thanks a lot and Love u mam\u2764\ufe0f",

In that case, you are a gem of a treasure we have found. Though we had to have a C-section due to complications, you have been the most supportive, encouraging and enthusiastic doctor we have ever met. Again, we thank you from the bottom of our heart as we are indebted to you for your great gesture.\n\nMay God bless you and your family with good health and may you continue this service for a long long time ahead \u263a\ufe0f\n\nThank you \ud83d\ude4f\n- Madhu Preetha & Bharath \ud83d\ude03",

She made sure me and my husband are confident to have a baby. Today i have a baby boy and i can't thank Dr. Misha enough for her support all throughout these years. She made sure all our doubts are cleared even virtually. She is still consulting me post delivery.

We approached couple of hospitals to treat adenomyosis as I had very painful periods but all suggested to try for a baby, which was not happening on the other hand .. Then I approached Misha mam seeing  the reviews in practo and Google ( which was the best decision I have ever made in my life). On the same day we did HSG test To check if I have any blockage in my fallopian tube.. then had a blood test which showed my prolactin level was high . She gave me medication for a month and very next month I conceived naturally.. She guided me very well through out my pregnancy and also was frequently checking my health condition when I was tested with covid in my 37th week..I delivered my baby boy safely with her help.. Thank you mam.will always admire you for your positive attitude ",

Had life threatening complications during delivery,  but doctor's timely decision making and intense care gave a speedy recovery and we were back from danger. Doctor was available at any time to clarify our doubts and also was available even after post delivery. May God bless you immensely and we extend our wish to continue your service. Thank you",

The very first consultation itself gave me confidence that I will be able to do normal delivery since I am very scared for injections itself. Mam listens to every concern that we have and even if it's asked several times. The most important thing we expect during pregnancy is positive support both mentally and physically which is the key factor that makes mam stand apart from many other doctors whom I have personally known.Being a first time mom I had many doubts which are even silly to be asked to your doctor but still when we wats app or call mam she replies to it very polite.Also like to mention about clinic's reception desk which is very helpful and clinic is well maintained.I was blessed with baby boy on Feb 19 2021.Thank you so much mam for being with us in the most important phase of our life's.You will always be a part in my prayers.",

We have blessed with boy baby \ud83d\udc66 on last week (C-section  delivery).\nI searched for gynaecologist online and i found about doctor Misha. We just entered only to confirm my happiness. She had been explaining each and every thing and their necessity to do from the first day of my check up very clearly.Haven't seen such a doctor to guide us and answer all our queries at any point of time. \nIn my 34th week, with your support (medical certificate) we are move to our native (Namakkal). Apart my husband, nobody with us for a help in Chennai and the situation is crucial in Chennai because of Covid-19.\nThank you very much for your support and suggestions on time.

She's been guiding us during our hard times before our due date. All she did was, maintained her patience and educated us by providing regular updates and possibilities of normal delivery and steps towards normal delivery. Results of her judgement and our hard work, My brave son roared at the end of 4th day. Still I could  write more.. I believe piece of work is enough to describe her passion on what she's been doing. My entire family Thanked her from bottom of heart. Thank you so much once again.",

Hearing some positive reviews consulted her and started our treatment. Her experience and systematic methods gave us immense hope and with God's grace i got conceived in my first cycle of treatment with her. Inspite of several complications viz PIH and IUGR which she deduced at the right time and treated me accordingly i gave birth normally(miracle indeed) to a healthy baby boy in Nov 2017. we entirely owe Dr.Misha Pepsi a lot and becos of her we are happy parents now.",
