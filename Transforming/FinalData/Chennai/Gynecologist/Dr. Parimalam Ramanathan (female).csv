"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I am overwhelmed by the treatment and services rendered by Dr Parimalam and Dr Leonard. We have gone to many hospitals getting appointments from prominent doctors both in India and in abroad but all in vain.

Dr Parimalam clearly said will go step by step. We followed the instructions given by both the doctors. Specific to mention that Dr Leonard before taking scan, Dr clearly explains the purposes and makes us to understand both positive and negative aspects. Both of them are approachable and they are trustworthy human beings. The IVF treatment and procedure was done by Dr Parimalam. We are blessed with a boy baby on March 8, 2024. We were longing and planning for a gift of child for almost 12 years. We thank Dr Parimalam and Dr Leonard for their continuous treatment and support. Both of them are very cool and calm persons.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I wanted to express my gratitude towards Dr Parimalam and Dr Leonard for providing the best pregnancy and delivery experience. As a 24 year old I was too scared during my final trimester . But having Dr Parimalam as my OBGYN, I had such a nice experience. My first pregnancy was a cake walk with their help. At around 28 weeks , we found my AFI level is below average and got to know there might be chances for preterm . But Dr Parimalam and Dr Leonard handled it in a very calm and confident way and by gods grace I delivered my baby healthily at 38+ weeks. She is so friendly like we can call or ping her anytime for help.  Even post delivery she is following up with me asking for health updates of myself and my baby.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnant Women Counseling,",0,0,YES,"I consulted with Dr Parimalam and Dr Leonard at London Harley clinic for my second pregnancy. I moved cities half way in my pregnancy and was worried about transitioning to a different gynaec. I dug deep and found Dr Parimalam through her rave reviews for her personal care to patients and thats exactly what i was looking for, after having a very disappointing experience in a big hospital for my first delivery where my gynaec didnt even turn up for the delivery and only consulted by phone! 

And i struck gold with Dr Parimalam! 
She is very caring, remembers details about you and gives you all the time in the world for all your questions and never rushes you even when the patient load is high. Same goes for Dr Leonard who was our ultrasonologist  and is absolutely best at the job. They make a great team, highly competent in their fields! I crossed 39 weeks and Dr Parimalam was all for completely normal progression of labor and was super supportive and encouraged me to stay put. I delivered my baby girl through vaginal delivery a few days before my due date with no intervention to augment labor. 

I would highly recommend them for anyone looking for a caring personal experience in this fast paced time where doctors dont have more than a few minutes to spare.",2022-12-01 13:58:38,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
