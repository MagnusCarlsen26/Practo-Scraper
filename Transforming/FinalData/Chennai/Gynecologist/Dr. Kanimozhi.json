While the most-painful moment of our life 'baby-expelling' happened, later my wife had to fight for her own life with a heavy/non-stop bleed - during when Dr. Kanimozhi stayed (strong) with her and accompanied her throughout that 1 hour at night,  pro-actively prepared us for all that was required to stabilise her (like blood collection in stock, para-medics). As we were sleepless on that dreadful night, Dr too seems to have continuously been checking with the clinic for continued nursing care through out that night. That's the moment we felt like an extended family with Dr and team - when someone cared us so deep in that distressed hour - taking us through our 'recovering moments' after a storm. \n\nWhen people around us, at that moment, cursed the Dr and hospitals/procedures as lapses - we knew in our hearts about what struggles that the Dr and team had to go thru along with us in such situations, - we did keep everyone in our prayers for their good deed and saving us thru' the crisis and unprecedented miscarriage event for all. \n\nNOW the good part of transformation ! \n\nWe pursued treatment after 1yr break and here now my wife is pregnant in her 20th week - this time we are blessed 'doubly'.\n\nWe thank God and God-sent Dr Kanimozhi and her team for recreating this beautiful moment. We have always admired at her sharp memories and caringly  remembering important dates and medical reports that reflected as personal care beyond any Dr normal duties and paved way to this turn-around !! \n\nIt's more reassuring for us now and a reminder that \"life goes on, whatever happens - just to believe, and move on spreading love, care and affection all over. Count your blessings everyday\" ...  \n\n\nBowing with respect, love and loads of gratitude to you Dr Kanimozhi + AK Fertlity and Apollo Cradles team - Hearty wishes and prayers for your continued dedicated service, care and successfully 'treating' the needy ones and your noble journey to transform people's lives ....  and May your family and dear ones be blessed !! \n\nHeart-felt regards and love,\nVijayakanth and Nithya (& Baby Mirudhula)",

She is someone whom we can relate to like a mentor just in the 1st visit. She gave best advices and gave good pre pregnancy counselling with everything clearly explained and from then on every visits, scans and medical advices, up to now has been extremely satisfying and purposeful. We feel very much happy and relieved in each checkup as she boosts us with lots of positivity and gave us too much of hope that I would get pregnant naturally. With all her support, I was conceived after two months of regular medication under her. The happiest moment in our life happened only because we met her. Dr. Kanimozhi always wear a warm smile with excellent confident and pleasant attitude which would wipe away all your doubts and health anxieties away. The most important thing that I liked on overall lookup is she is not at all money based . Being in a budgeted family control, these medical checkups would rather bring us tension and anxiety with more expenses. But to our luck, we found this doctor Who is actually Genuine enough and asks us to take limited scan or do tests only if required rather than pulling us down at every stretch. Thank you so much ma'am for fulfilling our life to the fullest with my baby. Will definitely share my delivery experience too once my baby is in to this world. I would hardly recommend my Dr. Kanimozhi to anyone who is planning for your pregnancy and pregnancy related care. Definitely you won't regret after visiting her.",

We've consulted in many hospitals in city without any improvement on our infertility treatment. When we got a chance to meet her for the First time, we have been given positive hopes which gained more confidence on her. She is very friendly in nature. We especially loved how Dr. K Kanimozhi really took her time to explain our condition post thorough examination as well as our treatment option. She worked with us to address our health concerns First rather than telling us what to do. We underwent her best treatment option and successfully having a baby now. She has stood for all of our needs and made herself available during our vist and treatment with her. We are all the time grateful for her consultations and for offering her best professional practices to us throughout this successful journey. \n\nWe had a great visit and the Doctor's demeanor has really put us easy so we highly recommend her and clinic.

She will be available in whatsApp too and cleared our doubts that helped us during pandemic time. I had cervical incompetence and was on complete bed rest. Due to medicines ,  cervical cerclage and doctor's positive words, I was  able to carry my baby till 37 weeks. Doctor always respects our decision. Even for last minute change of hospital of delivery,she agreed. She always insisted me to go for normal delivery ,as I was not able to bear pain I asked for c section for which also she supported. She remembers all her patients history. The clinic is always neat and clean with trained and friendly staff. ****** *** ** ***** ********* *** explains every thing clearly . She listens to our problems patiently . I strongly  recommend  Dr Kanimozhi mam if anyone want happy and safe pregnancy and delivery",

She is very optimistic, even when you walk inside her room with small negative thought she will boost your thoughts and will give you lot of confidence. I became pregnant in first ovulation cycle treatment and I have delivered my bundle of joy baby girl in her care. Mine was complicated pregnancy right from 6 weeks.I had lot of problems bleeding, thyroid, pregnancy sugar and underwent cervical stitch in 5th month. however I have delivered my baby in 38 weeks,it was possible only because of Dr. Kanimozhi. She was very careful that I should not deliver a preterm baby. She was available anytime over phone and gave her guidance. I feel more comfortable and safe whenever I went for check up . Without her I wouldn't have delivered my baby girl normally. Dr. Kanimozhi has become role model for me . Her patience, smiling face and positive vibe around her(which strengthens me) , apologies even when there is slight delay. From the bottom of my heart thanks doctor for all your support and care. I will remember you forever in my life whenever I hold my baby girl hand.I highly recommend Dr. Kanimozhi for Fertility treatment, she is too good for handling complicated woman's health issues. All the best mam for your future endeavours.\u00a0",

While the most-painful moment of our life 'baby-expelling' happened, later my wife had to fight for her own life with a heavy/non-stop bleed - during when Dr. Kanimozhi stayed (strong) with her and accompanied her throughout that 1 hour at night,  pro-actively prepared us for all that was required to stabilise her (like blood collection in stock, para-medics). As we were sleepless on that dreadful night, Dr too seems to have continuously been checking with the clinic for continued nursing care through out that night. That's the moment we felt like an extended family with Dr and team - when someone cared us so deep in that distressed hour - taking us through our 'recovering moments' after a storm. \n\nWhen people around us, at that moment, cursed the Dr and hospitals/procedures as lapses - we knew in our hearts about what struggles that the Dr and team had to go thru along with us in such situations, - we did keep everyone in our prayers for their good deed and saving us thru' the crisis and unprecedented miscarriage event for all. \n\nNOW the good part of transformation ! \n\nWe pursued treatment after 1yr break and here now my wife is pregnant in her 20th week - this time we are blessed 'doubly'.\n\nWe thank God and God-sent Dr Kanimozhi and her team for recreating this beautiful moment. We have always admired at her sharp memories and caringly  remembering important dates and medical reports that reflected as personal care beyond any Dr normal duties and paved way to this turn-around !! \n\nIt's more reassuring for us now and a reminder that \"life goes on, whatever happens - just to believe, and move on spreading love, care and affection all over. Count your blessings everyday\" ...  \n\n\nBowing with respect, love and loads of gratitude to you Dr Kanimozhi + AK Fertlity and Apollo Cradles team - Hearty wishes and prayers for your continued dedicated service, care and successfully 'treating' the needy ones and your noble journey to transform people's lives ....  and May your family and dear ones be blessed !! \n\nHeart-felt regards and love,\nVijayakanth and Nithya (& Baby Mirudhula)",

She is someone whom we can relate to like a mentor just in the 1st visit. She gave best advices and gave good pre pregnancy counselling with everything clearly explained and from then on every visits, scans and medical advices, up to now has been extremely satisfying and purposeful. We feel very much happy and relieved in each checkup as she boosts us with lots of positivity and gave us too much of hope that I would get pregnant naturally. With all her support, I was conceived after two months of regular medication under her. The happiest moment in our life happened only because we met her. Dr. Kanimozhi always wear a warm smile with excellent confident and pleasant attitude which would wipe away all your doubts and health anxieties away. The most important thing that I liked on overall lookup is she is not at all money based . Being in a budgeted family control, these medical checkups would rather bring us tension and anxiety with more expenses. But to our luck, we found this doctor Who is actually Genuine enough and asks us to take limited scan or do tests only if required rather than pulling us down at every stretch. Thank you so much ma'am for fulfilling our life to the fullest with my baby. Will definitely share my delivery experience too once my baby is in to this world. I would hardly recommend my Dr. Kanimozhi to anyone who is planning for your pregnancy and pregnancy related care. Definitely you won't regret after visiting her.",

We've consulted in many hospitals in city without any improvement on our infertility treatment. When we got a chance to meet her for the First time, we have been given positive hopes which gained more confidence on her. She is very friendly in nature. We especially loved how Dr. K Kanimozhi really took her time to explain our condition post thorough examination as well as our treatment option. She worked with us to address our health concerns First rather than telling us what to do. We underwent her best treatment option and successfully having a baby now. She has stood for all of our needs and made herself available during our vist and treatment with her. We are all the time grateful for her consultations and for offering her best professional practices to us throughout this successful journey. \n\nWe had a great visit and the Doctor's demeanor has really put us easy so we highly recommend her and clinic.

She will be available in whatsApp too and cleared our doubts that helped us during pandemic time. I had cervical incompetence and was on complete bed rest. Due to medicines ,  cervical cerclage and doctor's positive words, I was  able to carry my baby till 37 weeks. Doctor always respects our decision. Even for last minute change of hospital of delivery,she agreed. She always insisted me to go for normal delivery ,as I was not able to bear pain I asked for c section for which also she supported. She remembers all her patients history. The clinic is always neat and clean with trained and friendly staff. ****** *** ** ***** ********* *** explains every thing clearly . She listens to our problems patiently . I strongly  recommend  Dr Kanimozhi mam if anyone want happy and safe pregnancy and delivery",

During this tough times of Covid-19 pandemic, she supported us a lot and also reachable on her mobile round the clock. One of the most gratifying things about\u00a0 Dr. Kanimozhi is she will take up the entire responsibility from starting until baby is delivered safe. We cannot thank you enough for the excellent care you have provided.\u00a0 From the moment we met you, we were certain God had led us to you.

She is very optimistic, even when you walk inside her room with small negative thought she will boost your thoughts and will give you lot of confidence. I became pregnant in first ovulation cycle treatment and I have delivered my bundle of joy baby girl in her care. Mine was complicated pregnancy right from 6 weeks.I had lot of problems bleeding, thyroid, pregnancy sugar and underwent cervical stitch in 5th month. however I have delivered my baby in 38 weeks,it was possible only because of Dr. Kanimozhi. She was very careful that I should not deliver a preterm baby. She was available anytime over phone and gave her guidance. I feel more comfortable and safe whenever I went for check up . Without her I wouldn't have delivered my baby girl normally. Dr. Kanimozhi has become role model for me . Her patience, smiling face and positive vibe around her(which strengthens me) , apologies even when there is slight delay. From the bottom of my heart thanks doctor for all your support and care. I will remember you forever in my life whenever I hold my baby girl hand.I highly recommend Dr. Kanimozhi for Fertility treatment, she is too good for handling complicated woman's health issues. All the best mam for your future endeavours.\u00a0",

I have seen many used to give unwanted pills. but she did not prescribe any such. i also reduced and the cycle became regular. By the way i got conceived naturally. now again i am approaching her because she is so friendly and always explaining in detail the do's and dont's clearly. waiting time to see doctor is minimal. I gain confidence in me whenever i meet Dr. Kanimozhi mam. Thanks.",

With her support, care and guidance, I was able to conceive in short span of time. Though I had cervical incompetence, I was able to carry my baby till 37 weeks, thanks to her early diagnosis and corrective course of action. She is very cost effective. She explains all the issues in detail and accepts our feedback, before deciding further. She is patient friendly. She is always available on Whatsapp in case of any doubts. Thanks to her, my wish of becoming a mother is fulfilled. THANKS TO YOU MAM!!\n\nShe is highly recommended and undoubtedly one of the best!! ",

And now we are blessed with a bunch of happiness. I really thank Dr.kanimozhi for bringing so much happiness in our family. She clearly explains the treatment which she is going to proceed for us, so that we can stay confident.Even she doesnot give unnecessary tablets. Getting such a wonderful doctor is a pure bliss, she never forgets each patients history, everytime I wonder when she says am this am weeks old without seeing my scan reports or files. I really thank you once again mam for bring little princesses in our life. ",

She had counselled us with full of Positive energy  and gave us hope to restart the treatment. She is more friendly doctor that we haven't met before.  We went for IVF treatment and succeeded in the first cycle itself. During pregnancy my wife had thyroid and sugar, but Madam had taken care of all  the complications throughout the pregnancy. On October 02,2019 we have welcomed our little princess.\nA simple word of thanks  to mam is not enough for this blessing in our life. \nFrom my bottom of heart we would recommend madam for  any gynecology treatment . She is one of the best  doctors for infertility treatment in Chennai. She is ethical and take personal care towards her patients.",

She relies on her experience and knowledge rather than checking things now and then with machines. Most importantly she is very friendly and clarified all our questions during all our visits and not to forget the cleanliness of the rooms and premises\u00a0which were never compromised compared to big hospitals. And we were happy with overall experience and also suggested to my friends as well.Thanks Dr.KanimozhiGayathri S",
