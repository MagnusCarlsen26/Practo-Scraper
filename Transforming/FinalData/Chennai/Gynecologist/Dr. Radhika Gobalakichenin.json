She was very patient and encouraging throughout the process, answered questions very clearly without jargon. She was amazing as my surgeon. A post op spike in pain I had was due to a nursing oversight but she was caring and still monitoring the situation alertly. Neat, clean surgery that I recovered with fully without any trouble or infection. She didn't palm me off to a side kick and was very easy to reach - you didn't need to wait for days for each appointment. She is a really excellent gynecologist, I've been recommending her to all the women I know after my experience. Oh and very transparent and honest also: you know that you're doing only the necessary tests, she also gives you full choice for where to do testing or surgery explaining pros and cons, without any pressure.",

Surgery dates were conveniently booked, well planned and executed flawlessly. Post op recovery was excellent with no issues, walking in 2 days as promised by her.  Never took any referral or second opinion. Decision was easy, as all it needed was faith and she gave that in plenty. Thank you Dr. Radhika. ",
