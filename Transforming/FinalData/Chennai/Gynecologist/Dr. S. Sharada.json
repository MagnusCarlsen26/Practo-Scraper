I was diagnosed with Endometriosis cyst on my ovaries by Dr. Sharadha when I was 23 years old and she recommended immediate surgery for cysts removal. Since my family is from Karnataka, I had to do my surgery in my native. Since I was working in Chennai, I was consulting Dr. Sharada for all the post surgery treatment. I was very much devastated to know that there is no permanent solution for this chocolate cyst and even after removing, it can REGROW again and again unless you suppress the growth. Patients who have Endometriosis will not be able to lead a normal life due to its symptoms, cost associated with its long term treatment and the concerns about future.\nI was suggested for oral medicines for suppressing the growth of the cysts. The results are good and now I have no cysts in my ovaries and still on medications over 4 years to avoid reoccurring the cysts.\nThe most important thing I got from Dr. Sharada was a ray of hope. Whenever I talk to her, it was so calming, new hope of leading life peacefully though I have endometriosis. She always treated me as a person more than a patient, understanding my anxiety about my future as a working lady, answering all my questions that I had in my mind about this disease. She gave me confidence that I can lead my life without being pressurized due to this disease or its effects on my future.\nNow I am working in UAE, she advised me to find a new doctor here and continue th follow-ups. Since last one year though I am not visiting her personally, she is available to me to give advice on the treatment, I update her about my current checkups.\nShe is the example that if you have good caring doctor, you need not be scared of the disease.\nThanks for treating me right, thanks for your valuable advice and many thanks for understanding my personal situation as a lady.\nI am glad that I found her accidentally, not bcz of any recommendations, but I recommend her to all the ladies out there!\nThank you.",

For this reason I have faced infertility problem. After that my husband got suggestions from some other doctors, they preferred me to remove the endrometriosis through surgery and after that only I have a possibilities for pregnancy.\nBut Dr.Sharada mam only treated me without surgery for endimetriosis. She advised us to plan for a baby and I have followed her treatment. After 4 months I got pregnant and throughout my whole pregnancy I have visited Dr.Sharadha mam only. She has treated me very well and I am very thankful to Dr.Sharadha mam. If any one having problem of endrometriosis , I would strongly recommend Dr.Sharada mam. ",

Initially me and my husband were very nervous, as it is our first kid. But Dr. Sharada explained everything that I need to take care even though I didn't have any idea what to ask. In every stage, she used to explain clearly about the situation and caring in very simple manner so that layman also can understand. We can't forget her caring when I got couple of complications during pregnancy. \nDr. Sharada is honest and helpful, because of which we did not even get a thought of going for second opinion. She understands patients and their sentiments and gives good suggestions accordingly.\n\nThroughout my pregnancy, She took care of me like her family member which I can't forget in my life.\n\n@Dr.Sharada Ma'am, we can't forget your receiving with lovable smiling. We always wish you more success and happiness in your life.",

I was diagnosed with Endometriosis cyst on my ovaries by Dr. Sharadha when I was 23 years old and she recommended immediate surgery for cysts removal. Since my family is from Karnataka, I had to do my surgery in my native. Since I was working in Chennai, I was consulting Dr. Sharada for all the post surgery treatment. I was very much devastated to know that there is no permanent solution for this chocolate cyst and even after removing, it can REGROW again and again unless you suppress the growth. Patients who have Endometriosis will not be able to lead a normal life due to its symptoms, cost associated with its long term treatment and the concerns about future.\nI was suggested for oral medicines for suppressing the growth of the cysts. The results are good and now I have no cysts in my ovaries and still on medications over 4 years to avoid reoccurring the cysts.\nThe most important thing I got from Dr. Sharada was a ray of hope. Whenever I talk to her, it was so calming, new hope of leading life peacefully though I have endometriosis. She always treated me as a person more than a patient, understanding my anxiety about my future as a working lady, answering all my questions that I had in my mind about this disease. She gave me confidence that I can lead my life without being pressurized due to this disease or its effects on my future.\nNow I am working in UAE, she advised me to find a new doctor here and continue th follow-ups. Since last one year though I am not visiting her personally, she is available to me to give advice on the treatment, I update her about my current checkups.\nShe is the example that if you have good caring doctor, you need not be scared of the disease.\nThanks for treating me right, thanks for your valuable advice and many thanks for understanding my personal situation as a lady.\nI am glad that I found her accidentally, not bcz of any recommendations, but I recommend her to all the ladies out there!\nThank you.",

For this reason I have faced infertility problem. After that my husband got suggestions from some other doctors, they preferred me to remove the endrometriosis through surgery and after that only I have a possibilities for pregnancy.\nBut Dr.Sharada mam only treated me without surgery for endimetriosis. She advised us to plan for a baby and I have followed her treatment. After 4 months I got pregnant and throughout my whole pregnancy I have visited Dr.Sharadha mam only. She has treated me very well and I am very thankful to Dr.Sharadha mam. If any one having problem of endrometriosis , I would strongly recommend Dr.Sharada mam. ",

In every stage, she used to explain clearly about the situation and caring in very simple manner so that layman also can understand. We can't forget her caring when I got couple of complications during pregnancy. \nDr. Sharada is honest and helpful, because of which we did not even get a thought of going for second opinion. She understands patients and their sentiments and gives good suggestions accordingly.\n\nThroughout my pregnancy, She took care of me like her family member which I can't forget in my life.\n\n@Dr.Sharada Ma'am, we can't forget your receiving with lovable smiling.

I wondered how much passion,love ,caring and commitment she has towards her job. Myself and my younger sister had normal delivery by Dr.Sharadha.  I missed her very much after my delivery. I had a good bond with her. So after delivery I felt that thereafter I will not get chance to meet the doctor until my next pregnancy. Such a wonderful heart. The most caring person. I have never seen such doctors in my life. I was very much comfortable with her from pregnancy check until delivery. No words to explain her dedication. I don't know when will she get time to sleep. She is a good role model for all. Thank you so much mam for all your kindness throughout my delivery and my sister's delivery.  Lots of love and prayers for you.",

It was a great journey through the pregnancy and cannot forget how patiently she was with us for about 5 hours waiting for a normal delivery till almost midnight. Best of luck to the doctor.
