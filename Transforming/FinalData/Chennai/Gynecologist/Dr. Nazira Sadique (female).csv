"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Nazira ma'am has definitely been a very hands-on doctor during my pregnancy and delivery process. She respects the patient's comfort and concerns *** ******* ***** *** ******* *** ******** ************* which is really very sweet and kind of her. Such a thing is not very common in other OB/Gyn doctors. She answers all our queries and helps us with whatever pregnancy-related issues we may be facing. 

Especially during my labour process, she was  so completely involved that it made me feel at ease and more confident to go through my labour process with her continuous help, advice and supervision even though my labour process was a bit prolonged. She's so experienced and ************* that it surely reduces your anxiety in the labour room knowing that you and your baby are in safe hands. Sometimes doctors can make you feel more scared, tensed and anxious during your labour and it really makes things worse for the patient who is already trying to cope up with the contractions but Dr. Nazira ma'am made sure I was comfortable throughout the process and she always listened patiently to what I had to say during that time. She made sure that I was taken care of properly during and after my labour process and didn't allow any unnecessary disturbances towards me since I had just gone through a lot of pain and exhaustion. 

Even after the delivery, she would visit me every day during my 3-day stay in the hospital to make sure I was healing well and ask me if I have any concerns whatsoever. Not all doctors are this kind and sweet while being so experienced *** ************* at the same time! I'm really so thankful to Dr. Nazira ma'am for taking care of me so well throughout my pregnancy and delivery and even post-delivery. It was truly a very good experience. I would highly recommend this doctor to anyone expecting. *** ** *** **** **** ***** ** **** ",2023-10-18 22:31:17,False,True,Israa,Thank you for your appreciation ,2023-12-08T15:47:15+0000,Dr. Nazira Sadique
