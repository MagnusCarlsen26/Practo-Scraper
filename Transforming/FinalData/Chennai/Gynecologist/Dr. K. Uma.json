Myself and my husband met her @ Cloud9, Chennai with a confused mind... during my second month of pregnancy carrying twin babies. It was my second pregnancy. we were confused whether to move ahead or terminate. But Thanks to my Angel Dr.Uma, in a 5 minutes consultation session she made our mind Clear to move ahead with the pregnancy with no further double thoughts. Her valuable suggestions made my pregnancy period very much enjoyable carrying my twin babies. Even though they came out in the 31st week, She gave us the confidence and timely support. She is an Angel doctor. Thanks a lot Mam.",

Myself and my husband met her @ Cloud9, Chennai with a confused mind... during my second month of pregnancy carrying twin babies. It was my second pregnancy. we were confused whether to move ahead or terminate. But Thanks to my Angel Dr.Uma, in a 5 minutes consultation session she made our mind Clear to move ahead with the pregnancy with no further double thoughts. Her valuable suggestions made my pregnancy period very much enjoyable carrying my twin babies. Even though they came out in the 31st week, She gave us the confidence and timely support. She is an Angel doctor. Thanks a lot Mam.",
