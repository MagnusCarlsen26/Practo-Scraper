We have gone to many hospitals getting appointments from prominent doctors both in India and in abroad but all in vain. We came to know London Harley street clinic through one of my friends who also took treatment and blessed with two kids. We approached Dr Parimalam with previous reports. Dr Parimalam clearly said will go step by step. We followed the instructions given by both the doctors. Specific to mention that Dr Leonard before taking scan, Dr clearly explains the purposes and makes us to understand both positive and negative aspects. Both of them are approachable and they are trustworthy human beings. The IVF treatment and procedure was done by Dr Parimalam. We are blessed with a boy baby on March 8, 2024. We were longing and planning for a gift of child for almost 12 years. We thank Dr Parimalam and Dr Leonard for their continuous treatment and support. Both of them are very cool and calm persons. The nurses and staff assistants are also very helpful and they behave politely. We highly recommend London Harley clinic to anyone. We are always indebted to Dr Parimalam and Dr Leonard.",

I lost my first child due to a gynaec (based on Perumbakkam Main Road), who had very insensitive approach towards patients and unprofessional/unruly behaviour. After scouting and interacting with various doctors on the OMR side (we consulted 12 doctors), we narrowed down on London Harley Street Women and Fertility Center. I told my sob story to Dr. Parimalam and I frankly spoke about my trust issues with doctor based on my previous experience. Dr.Parimalam assured her best.  My treatment started with Dr. Parimalam and I was in my comfort zone because her approach is to advise you all the possible situation/options at every step so that we can take informed decisions. She always puts the well-being of the mother and baby first. Whenever she prescribes medicines/test/taking rest, she would brief me on why this test/medicine has to be taken the short/long-term implications. Never felt she is giving me additional test/medicine than required (because I also do google search parallelly based on my condition).Being a high-risk pregnancy, Dr. Parimalam would always monitor and track my health status. Unlike many doctors, she is available on Mobile/WhatsApp which is a big plus. Also, she remembers your case and need not remind the doctors again-n-again unlike many doctors.For me due to some complications, I had opted for a C-Section after lot of discussion with family. But based on her experience & my body condition Dr. Parimalam advised me that there is a high possibility for normal delivery and counselled me. I ended up delivering a healthy baby through normal delivery. Closer to the due date, Dr. Parimalam proactively inquired about my health and tracked it meticulously which is very reassuring.Another advantage going to LHS, is Dr. Leonard (Radiologist). * ***** **** *** ** *** **** *********** ** ***** he will spend lot of time during every scan and brief you about the baby\u2019s growth which will be reassuring towards the 10-month journey. Due to my high-risk pregnancy I had to take couple of emergency scan closer to my house and at some of the best hospitals, I could see the difference in quality of work.If you are looking for a doctor who is high on ethics and professional behaviour, then it will be Dr. Parimalam Ramanathan. Pros:Very professional ApproachPuts Child & Mother well-being firstShe will educate your throughout the 10-month journeyCons:Whenever she is in procedure/treatment your mobile response might be delayed",

She takes personal care on the patients. She shares her personal contact number with her patients and can be approached anytime even via WhatsApp.Dr. Shivapriya who assists Dr. Parimalam is very polite, approachable and clears our tiny doubts patiently.\u00a0Dr.leonard (Dr.Parimalam's husband) is the radiologist who handles the scans. He does all the scans in a very detailed manner. Even during peak hours he does not rush through the scan and makes it a point to explain each and everything to the patient clearly during the scan. Initially I had apprehensions that a male doctor is handling the scans. The staffs and the doctor respect our modesty and keep us in our comfort zone during the scans.Both the doctors seem to have practised extensively in London. They have carried all their rich experiences back to India.The place is very clean and well-kept and we dont get the sick feeling that we usually get at the other nursing homes. All facilities are available within the centre itself - medicals, a lab to collect blood samples, scan facility etc. They don't make you run around to other places for such things. They give high priority to emergency cases and handle them promptly. The cost of consultation and scans are reasonable.The other helper staff here are very polite and courteous. But they need to be more organised during peak hours like weekends. The main disadvantage is the lack of a proper appointment and tokenised system in maintaining the order of the patients. If someone from LHS reads the review, kindly consider implementing a token system. Including the waiting time, approximately it takes a max of 3 hours to finish a scan consultation\u00a0 and a max of 1 hour for just consultation. But it was worth the wait time. We just need to be mentally prepared to wait and respect others time as well.There is also a provision to attend special pregnancy yoga classes within the centre. Master Ramadoss from shanthi school of yoga conducts the yoga classes in the mornings. I have seen all the staffs and doctors working continuously from the morning even till 3 pm without taking a lunch break during the 15  times that I have visited the centre. Initially we were skeptical if we should go to this clinic because it was termed as a fertility center. But, Overall i got a very pleasant and satisfactory experience at the centre which helped me enjoy my pregnancy more. Lately we can see the centre gaining more popularity and a lot of patients pouring in. ",

Also would like to thank the entire staff of London harley (special mention Divya) for managing our appointments and required help with the medications and reports. My wife delivered twins under the professional guidance of Dr Parimalam. We were new to chennai and luckily landed up with London harley, Entire pregnancy though categorized under high risk was smoothly managed by both the doctors and though i am not qualified enough to judge skill levels here but trust me one can feel comfortable with both the doctors, they are among the best in their field & really down to earth, our experience had been really great. They are always available on call/wassapp when needed.\n\nWould like to make special mention for Dr. Leonard. He would take the time and patience to explain the details to us. Entire pregnancy we trusted him only for the scanning details as our experience with some other doctors (when he was not available or when we were in the hospital) for scanning was not great.\nEven a day before the delivery he took the time and patience to do the required scan for us in the hospital..my wife was really tense due to some reason and i still remember the smile and comfort when she saw Dr. Leonard in the hospital ward room to do the required scanning.\nAfter delivery Archana went through a serious complication related to breathing and it was because of the prompt decision of Dr Parimalam and Apollo staff that she came out of it successfully.\n\nOnce again i would like to really thank both the doctors for the support and patience towards handling our queries. Its a bond that we share now with both you. Also thanking you on behalf of AADI & KABIR (Our twin boys)",

After waiting for some half an hour one lady called my wife. I thought she is the assistant and will take the normal weight, blood pressure etc., but to my surprise she stated giving the consultation to my wife and later called me and started explaining  me the course of action and suggested to do ultrasound. It's only when I asked her that I have booked the appointment to see Dr. Panimalar and I was promised on practo that  Dr panimalar will see the case, then she told us that Dr. Panimalar will be coming in some time. After waiting for another one hour, i.e. at around 12 noon, we got the appointment with Dr. panimalar. She suggested to do ultrasound and asked my wife to drink water. After half an hour, my wife told me that she is feeling that her bladder is full and she can not hold it further. I requested the staff to make it a bit quick, to which they replied that within 5 mins they will call, but the y called only after 20 mins when my wife told that she can not hold it. The radiologist doctor was a nice person and did the things well. The doctor further suggested to do blood test and promised that the report they can verbally share by 7:30 PM over phone. \nI asked the ultrasound report, to which they said that you will have to come on Monday to receive the same.\nThen I went to the reception  to pay the bill, after paying the bill I asked for receipt, to which they replied that bill you will get on monday. That was so unprofessional. I paid the amount for which I am asking the bill so that I can claim at my office. After I asked the reception that I need the bill now  as I have paid the amount, they asked to wait for another 10 mins for bill. By that time it was 2:00PM. Thus for an ultrasound and consultaion and more importantly the bill, we spent 3.5  hours there and paid Rs. 2400.\nThis is not the end of the sufferings, as they promised that they will tell the HCG report over phone by 7:30 PM, I called them, to which they said they have not got the report yet and I will get the same on Monday. They are unprofessional to the limit that they can not understand that I was so deadly waiting to hear the report and some good news. \nThis was the time when I literally got irritated. Why should I visit a clinic, where the staff including the doctor are not professional enough to keep their promises.\nThough I new that clinic is a bit costly still I visited the clinic thinking that I will be at a professional place as claimed by doctor in one of her reply to a Google review.\nBut I hardly found anyone professional and friendly there except the radiologist Dr Leonard I guess.",

She doesn't prescribe unnecessary medicines. And for particular tests to be done, she has adjusted according to our convenience.\n\nHer husband,who is a radiologist there,is also very good. He explains everything very well and ensures we are satisfied before leaving the place. Even when doctor is not available, her child ensures to answer the phone and give a sweet response.\nAll the staff at the hospital are good and helping at all times.\nDoctor has helped me a lot over the phone call and WhatsApp itself to take big decisions about my delivery (unfortunately I had to undergo my delivery at my native). Thanks for this doctor.\nIf you plan your delivery with this doctor, you will have an additional member in your family list and she will be someone who can never be forgotten for the treatment provided by her.\n",

No matter how worried we are, her composed way of dealing with the patients and the confidence she holds will make you feel that you are in safe hands. That was the only one reason we decided to have the delivery in Chennai. During labor, the doctor and her entire team in Apollo Cradle were very supportive and encouraging throughout.  No words will be enough to thank Dr. Parimalam & Dr Leonard and her team for bringing our boy to this world. We stay very near to LHS Clinic and When the pain started I was at office and doctor arranged a vehicle for my wife. She always enquire about the my wife  and baby even after the delivery. I dont think any of the other doctors will do a follow up after the delivery. Thank you so much Doctor!",

Since this was my first baby i was a little bit scared but she helped us get through each phase of pregnancy to ensure normal delivery. The doctor is very patient and explained every issue clearly whenever we had doubts, she even gave her personal number in case of emergency and even called us personally during the final stages of pregnancy to ensure that everything was fine that's how caring \nshe is with her patients.\n\nThe scan experience with Dr.Leonard was also great, he will thoroughly explain what he is going to show you before taking the scan so that you know why that scan is required. The staffs are also very courteous and helpful.\n\nThe medications are also very less and are prescribed only if it is really needed. \n\nI would like to say my heartfelt thanks to Dr.Parimalam and Dr.Leonard for helping us deliver our little bundle of joy safe and sound.\n\nIf you are near OMR or  even other nearby area don't think twice about visiting the doctor you will definitely have a positive experience.\n",

We had smooth sailing till my third trimester, during which I was diagnosed with hypertension. She gave me lot of confidence and scheduled frequent scans and consultations to monitor baby's health as well as mine. She was approachable through WhatsApp and mobile anytime and even when I delayed sending her my BP status, she followed up with me. I have never heard of any doctor doing this. \nWhen she decided to deliver the baby when scan reports were showing less weight gain for the baby, we completely trusted her judgement. I delivered a baby boy and  he is now doing great. She was kind enough to follow up regarding my health even after few weeks. Her care extends beyond professional services. I have recommended her already to my friends. \nScan services are also very satisfactory and Dr. Leonard explained every scan patiently and answered all our queries.\nHighly recommended.",

We have gone to many hospitals getting appointments from prominent doctors both in India and in abroad but all in vain. We came to know London Harley street clinic through one of my friends who also took treatment and blessed with two kids. We approached Dr Parimalam with previous reports. Dr Parimalam clearly said will go step by step. We followed the instructions given by both the doctors. Specific to mention that Dr Leonard before taking scan, Dr clearly explains the purposes and makes us to understand both positive and negative aspects. Both of them are approachable and they are trustworthy human beings. The IVF treatment and procedure was done by Dr Parimalam. We are blessed with a boy baby on March 8, 2024. We were longing and planning for a gift of child for almost 12 years. We thank Dr Parimalam and Dr Leonard for their continuous treatment and support. Both of them are very cool and calm persons. The nurses and staff assistants are also very helpful and they behave politely. We highly recommend London Harley clinic to anyone. We are always indebted to Dr Parimalam and Dr Leonard.",

I lost my first child due to a gynaec (based on Perumbakkam Main Road), who had very insensitive approach towards patients and unprofessional/unruly behaviour. After scouting and interacting with various doctors on the OMR side (we consulted 12 doctors), we narrowed down on London Harley Street Women and Fertility Center. I told my sob story to Dr. Parimalam and I frankly spoke about my trust issues with doctor based on my previous experience. Dr.Parimalam assured her best.  My treatment started with Dr. Parimalam and I was in my comfort zone because her approach is to advise you all the possible situation/options at every step so that we can take informed decisions. She always puts the well-being of the mother and baby first. Whenever she prescribes medicines/test/taking rest, she would brief me on why this test/medicine has to be taken the short/long-term implications. Never felt she is giving me additional test/medicine than required (because I also do google search parallelly based on my condition).Being a high-risk pregnancy, Dr. Parimalam would always monitor and track my health status. Unlike many doctors, she is available on Mobile/WhatsApp which is a big plus. Also, she remembers your case and need not remind the doctors again-n-again unlike many doctors.For me due to some complications, I had opted for a C-Section after lot of discussion with family. But based on her experience & my body condition Dr. Parimalam advised me that there is a high possibility for normal delivery and counselled me. I ended up delivering a healthy baby through normal delivery. Closer to the due date, Dr. Parimalam proactively inquired about my health and tracked it meticulously which is very reassuring.Another advantage going to LHS, is Dr. Leonard (Radiologist). * ***** **** *** ** *** **** *********** ** ***** he will spend lot of time during every scan and brief you about the baby\u2019s growth which will be reassuring towards the 10-month journey. Due to my high-risk pregnancy I had to take couple of emergency scan closer to my house and at some of the best hospitals, I could see the difference in quality of work.If you are looking for a doctor who is high on ethics and professional behaviour, then it will be Dr. Parimalam Ramanathan. Pros:Very professional ApproachPuts Child & Mother well-being firstShe will educate your throughout the 10-month journeyCons:Whenever she is in procedure/treatment your mobile response might be delayed",

She takes personal care on the patients. She shares her personal contact number with her patients and can be approached anytime even via WhatsApp.Dr. Shivapriya who assists Dr. Parimalam is very polite, approachable and clears our tiny doubts patiently.\u00a0Dr.leonard (Dr.Parimalam's husband) is the radiologist who handles the scans. He does all the scans in a very detailed manner. Even during peak hours he does not rush through the scan and makes it a point to explain each and everything to the patient clearly during the scan. Initially I had apprehensions that a male doctor is handling the scans. The staffs and the doctor respect our modesty and keep us in our comfort zone during the scans.Both the doctors seem to have practised extensively in London. They have carried all their rich experiences back to India.The place is very clean and well-kept and we dont get the sick feeling that we usually get at the other nursing homes. All facilities are available within the centre itself - medicals, a lab to collect blood samples, scan facility etc. They don't make you run around to other places for such things. They give high priority to emergency cases and handle them promptly. The cost of consultation and scans are reasonable.The other helper staff here are very polite and courteous. But they need to be more organised during peak hours like weekends. The main disadvantage is the lack of a proper appointment and tokenised system in maintaining the order of the patients. If someone from LHS reads the review, kindly consider implementing a token system. Including the waiting time, approximately it takes a max of 3 hours to finish a scan consultation\u00a0 and a max of 1 hour for just consultation. But it was worth the wait time. We just need to be mentally prepared to wait and respect others time as well.There is also a provision to attend special pregnancy yoga classes within the centre. Master Ramadoss from shanthi school of yoga conducts the yoga classes in the mornings. I have seen all the staffs and doctors working continuously from the morning even till 3 pm without taking a lunch break during the 15  times that I have visited the centre. Initially we were skeptical if we should go to this clinic because it was termed as a fertility center. But, Overall i got a very pleasant and satisfactory experience at the centre which helped me enjoy my pregnancy more. Lately we can see the centre gaining more popularity and a lot of patients pouring in. ",

Also would like to thank the entire staff of London harley (special mention Divya) for managing our appointments and required help with the medications and reports. My wife delivered twins under the professional guidance of Dr Parimalam. We were new to chennai and luckily landed up with London harley, Entire pregnancy though categorized under high risk was smoothly managed by both the doctors and though i am not qualified enough to judge skill levels here but trust me one can feel comfortable with both the doctors, they are among the best in their field & really down to earth, our experience had been really great. They are always available on call/wassapp when needed.\n\nWould like to make special mention for Dr. Leonard. He would take the time and patience to explain the details to us. Entire pregnancy we trusted him only for the scanning details as our experience with some other doctors (when he was not available or when we were in the hospital) for scanning was not great.\nEven a day before the delivery he took the time and patience to do the required scan for us in the hospital..my wife was really tense due to some reason and i still remember the smile and comfort when she saw Dr. Leonard in the hospital ward room to do the required scanning.\nAfter delivery Archana went through a serious complication related to breathing and it was because of the prompt decision of Dr Parimalam and Apollo staff that she came out of it successfully.\n\nOnce again i would like to really thank both the doctors for the support and patience towards handling our queries. Its a bond that we share now with both you. Also thanking you on behalf of AADI & KABIR (Our twin boys)",

After waiting for some half an hour one lady called my wife. I thought she is the assistant and will take the normal weight, blood pressure etc., but to my surprise she stated giving the consultation to my wife and later called me and started explaining  me the course of action and suggested to do ultrasound. It's only when I asked her that I have booked the appointment to see Dr. Panimalar and I was promised on practo that  Dr panimalar will see the case, then she told us that Dr. Panimalar will be coming in some time. After waiting for another one hour, i.e. at around 12 noon, we got the appointment with Dr. panimalar. She suggested to do ultrasound and asked my wife to drink water. After half an hour, my wife told me that she is feeling that her bladder is full and she can not hold it further. I requested the staff to make it a bit quick, to which they replied that within 5 mins they will call, but the y called only after 20 mins when my wife told that she can not hold it. The radiologist doctor was a nice person and did the things well. The doctor further suggested to do blood test and promised that the report they can verbally share by 7:30 PM over phone. \nI asked the ultrasound report, to which they said that you will have to come on Monday to receive the same.\nThen I went to the reception  to pay the bill, after paying the bill I asked for receipt, to which they replied that bill you will get on monday. That was so unprofessional. I paid the amount for which I am asking the bill so that I can claim at my office. After I asked the reception that I need the bill now  as I have paid the amount, they asked to wait for another 10 mins for bill. By that time it was 2:00PM. Thus for an ultrasound and consultaion and more importantly the bill, we spent 3.5  hours there and paid Rs. 2400.\nThis is not the end of the sufferings, as they promised that they will tell the HCG report over phone by 7:30 PM, I called them, to which they said they have not got the report yet and I will get the same on Monday. They are unprofessional to the limit that they can not understand that I was so deadly waiting to hear the report and some good news. \nThis was the time when I literally got irritated. Why should I visit a clinic, where the staff including the doctor are not professional enough to keep their promises.\nThough I new that clinic is a bit costly still I visited the clinic thinking that I will be at a professional place as claimed by doctor in one of her reply to a Google review.\nBut I hardly found anyone professional and friendly there except the radiologist Dr Leonard I guess.",

She explains all the questions clearly and with lot of patience. She is available over phone almost all the time 24*7.\nTo have a happy pregnancy I would recommend to visit this doctor. She doesn't prescribe unnecessary medicines. And for particular tests to be done, she has adjusted according to our convenience.\n\nHer husband,who is a radiologist there,is also very good. He explains everything very well and ensures we are satisfied before leaving the place. Even when doctor is not available, her child ensures to answer the phone and give a sweet response.\nAll the staff at the hospital are good and helping at all times.\nDoctor has helped me a lot over the phone call and WhatsApp itself to take big decisions about my delivery (unfortunately I had to undergo my delivery at my native). Thanks for this doctor.\nIf you plan your delivery with this doctor, you will have an additional member in your family list and she will be someone who can never be forgotten for the treatment provided by her.\n",

We had heard and seen many positive reviews about her before consulting her for my wife's second delivery and our experience proves the same.  Her energy and enthusiasm are contagious. No matter how worried we are, her composed way of dealing with the patients and the confidence she holds will make you feel that you are in safe hands. That was the only one reason we decided to have the delivery in Chennai. During labor, the doctor and her entire team in Apollo Cradle were very supportive and encouraging throughout.  No words will be enough to thank Dr. Parimalam & Dr Leonard and her team for bringing our boy to this world. We stay very near to LHS Clinic and When the pain started I was at office and doctor arranged a vehicle for my wife. She always enquire about the my wife  and baby even after the delivery. I dont think any of the other doctors will do a follow up after the delivery. Thank you so much Doctor!",

The doctor is very patient and explained every issue clearly whenever we had doubts, she even gave her personal number in case of emergency and even called us personally during the final stages of pregnancy to ensure that everything was fine that's how caring \nshe is with her patients.\n\nThe scan experience with Dr.Leonard was also great, he will thoroughly explain what he is going to show you before taking the scan so that you know why that scan is required. The staffs are also very courteous and helpful.\n\nThe medications are also very less and are prescribed only if it is really needed. \n\nI would like to say my heartfelt thanks to Dr.Parimalam and Dr.Leonard for helping us deliver our little bundle of joy safe and sound.\n\nIf you are near OMR or  even other nearby area don't think twice about visiting the doctor you will definitely have a positive experience.\n",

She is very thorough in all check-ups and spends ample time with patients to explain things and clear doubts. We had smooth sailing till my third trimester, during which I was diagnosed with hypertension. She gave me lot of confidence and scheduled frequent scans and consultations to monitor baby's health as well as mine. She was approachable through WhatsApp and mobile anytime and even when I delayed sending her my BP status, she followed up with me. I have never heard of any doctor doing this. \nWhen she decided to deliver the baby when scan reports were showing less weight gain for the baby, we completely trusted her judgement. I delivered a baby boy and  he is now doing great. She was kind enough to follow up regarding my health even after few weeks. Her care extends beyond professional services. I have recommended her already to my friends. \nScan services are also very satisfactory and Dr. Leonard explained every scan patiently and answered all our queries.\nHighly recommended.",

She is * **** ************* ******* very clear and confident in her diagnosis; crisp in her advice. In our case, she gave the perfect solution for easy conception, which is usually overlooked by other doctors. She always proposes easier and safer solutions for all pregnancy related problems. Dr Parimalam is one of those doctors who strives for NORMAL DELIVERY. Although I was skeptical if I could deliver normally; doctor patiently convinced me to go for normal. She did her best to make sure my labor and delivery was a smooth one. Her positive words and high morale is what helped me go through a normal and healthy delivery. She's very reachable, she replies to your questions over whatsapp and also responds to calls in emergency situations. The clinic is clean and well maintained ; staff are hospitable. The Ultra sound scans are done by Dr.Leonard; who explains the details in a very warm and compassionate way. Now we are happy parents to a sweet little baby boy and I can confidently say it is Dr Parimalam who made our journey to parenthood a comfortable one: I doubt any other doctor would have been the same. We strongly recommend Dr Parimalam at London Harley Street Women and Fertility Clinic.",

We have been visiting her since 2 years for my wife  pregnancy, last week we got a baby.\n\nIf you look at the market you will see 95% of doctors are kind of corporate towards their revenue than thinking about the patient's health. But she is totally exceptional there, She is a real doctor, doesn't prescribe any unwanted tests or medicine. She is very down-to-earth, very approchable, never felt nervous while talking to her as she is very friendly and very caring at minute level. Unlike other doctors, she will remember every patient and their problem, doesn't need to refer file to recall patient problem.\n\nExample: At certain point of time, I was very doubtful about early labour and requested her to give steroids to improve baby's lungs. But she rejected my point stright away saying that we shouldn't give any medicine or steroids untill we need them genuinely. \n\nWhile we are nearing our due date, she started giving more attention and giving confidence to us by saying that; We are already crossed the danger zone, no need to worry about anything and if you feel any uncomfortable can shout me any time for any queries.\n\nAnd even she respect people belief, I requested her to do C-section at 6 AM in the morning by taking suggestion from our family priest, She respected our decision and did on requested time with out any delay though it is difficult to manage her personal life.\n\nI also wanted to thank Dr. Lenord sir for the detailed scans and explaining every bit scan. He is unlike others radiologists, never cares about his time, cares about fetal only. i.e. some times his scans goes for an hour to ensure everything is perfect at minute level.\n\nAll in all if you need a perfect doctor for infertility & pregnancy (with minimum medication and tests & very caring)  you go to Parimalam with out thinking.\n\nThanks,\nTiru & Dhanalakshmi",

When in search of the best doctor in terms of ethics, expertise and experience, we got numerous suggestions. We visited the big names around and none seemed fit. Money comes first in most of these places. They make you wait for a minimum of 2 hours.  And you are just a 'Patient number X' for these organizations and doctors.\n\nThankfully, Google helped us to this place called 'London Harley Street Clinic' headed by Dr.Parimalam Ramanathan in Perungudi. We visited the clinic just for a formal consultation. The moment we entered, there's something really positive all about it. That feeling consolidated after our first consultation with Dr.Parimalam. She was all that you wish for in a doctor. Courteous, genuine, disciplined, professional and most of all super well-learned in what she does. We were amazed by her simplicity and holistic approach. \n\nShe made sure that my wife seamlessly sailed through her first pregnancy. Every small detail was explained to us in detail and she has got all the patience in the world to clarify anything and everything you ask her. We never had an anxious moment from the day we visted 'LHS'. The longest waiting time in all of our visits is 20 mins. Amazing thing was Dr.Parimalam has the integrity to apologize even for that little thing. All the procedures were done on time and she made sure that we were well informed about optional procedures and their necessity. She even shares for personal mobile number and you will always get a prompt and proper response. During one of our consultations, my mother who came from our native for a visit, accompanied us and she was sick. Ma'am diagnosed her and apt medication was prescribed. Dr. Parimalam remembered and inquired about my mother's health in our next visits and only after she learned that my mother was all well, she stopped.  That's the kind of attention and care you get. \n\nMy wife had a normal delivery despite some complication and gave birth to a wonderful boy baby in all good health. We will always be grateful and consider ourselves fortunate enough to find such a amazing doctor. *** ** *** ***** Heart fully, Thank you Dr. Parimalam Ramanathan.",

As a 24 year old I was too scared during my final trimester . But having Dr Parimalam as my OBGYN, I had such a nice experience. My first pregnancy was a cake walk with their help. At around 28 weeks , we found my AFI level is below average and got to know there might be chances for preterm . But Dr Parimalam and Dr Leonard handled it in a very calm and confident way and by gods grace I delivered my baby healthily at 38+ weeks. She is so friendly like we can call or ping her anytime for help.  Even post delivery she is following up with me asking for health updates of myself and my baby. I highly recommend Dr Parimalam ** *** *** ********* *** *** **** ****** ",

She gave all tips for normal delivery, but due to unavoidable circumstances we had to go for a c-section. But still Dr.parimalam gave us hope and advised that there won't be any risk involved in the procedure. Both mother and baby are safe post delivery and she visited the hospital daily for post maternity examination.\n\n We would also like to thank Dr.Leonard, the radiologist in LHS. He would explain the scan name and the purpose of it, very clearly...Also he would ease out patient's fear with kind words. I don't think we would have any other scan centre where they would explain in detail about the scans as this one.",

Through her medical care I managed to reach the milestone and delivered a healthy baby by 39+6 weeks. There were times I reached her clinic during the closing times but she never bothered much about it and treated me well. She shares her personal number and is reachable all times. She personally reaches out to patients closer to due date to ensure they are doing well. \nShe doesn't prescribe medicines unnecessarily and has a more practical approach. \nI have got a healthy baby today and the credit goes to her. I would definitely recommend her for my friends and family. ",

Dr Leonard was also really nice & he always dedicated sufficient time to perform the scans and also gave detailed explanations during the scans. The clinic is very clean and well maintained. When i had sudden labour pain almost 4 weeks before the due date, we rushed to Apollo and Dr. Parimalam also arrived there soon despite the short notice. She performed the delivery and i gave birth to a healthy baby girl through normal delivery.  We'll definitely recommend Dr. Parimalam, Dr. Leonard and London Harley Street. ",

For an medical emergency, acted very promptly. \nDoesn't scares one with needless restrictions during pregnancy. Recommends medicines absolutely based on need. \nThe Scan instruments are very latest (unlike in my native can detect heartbeat even before 8 weeks, only need to drink water for first scan). The Scan doctor is great. He patiently explains everything to us in laymen terms and allows the family also during the scan.\nProbably, only area with scope of improvement is wait time. ",

She infact called me up herself after our 1st checkup to confirm pregnancy and congratulated. It felt great. She doesnt prescribe any medicine more than the essentials. Doesnt advise or charge unreasonably for scans at all. Whats more touching is, she also personally follows up post partum with so much care, I dont think any other doc does that.\n\nAnd her spouse Mr Leo, who is the sonographer, puts in time and effort to explain each and every scan perfectly, why its done , what does it signify and stuff.\n\nDr Parimalam is uber cool and absolutely helped me have a confident and pleasant maternity! Will surely recommend her  to anybody looking for proper and friendly gyn care and am planning to consult her in future too :) ",

I moved cities half way in my pregnancy and was worried about transitioning to a different gynaec. I dug deep and found Dr Parimalam through her rave reviews for her personal care to patients and thats exactly what i was looking for, after having a very disappointing experience in a big hospital for my first delivery where my gynaec didnt even turn up for the delivery and only consulted by phone! \n\nAnd i struck gold with Dr Parimalam! \nShe is very caring, remembers details about you and gives you all the time in the world for all your questions and never rushes you even when the patient load is high. Same goes for Dr Leonard who was our ultrasonologist  and is absolutely best at the job. They make a great team, highly competent in their fields! I crossed 39 weeks and Dr Parimalam was all for completely normal progression of labor and was super supportive and encouraged me to stay put. I delivered my baby girl through vaginal delivery a few days before my due date with no intervention to augment labor. \n\nI would highly recommend them for anyone looking for a caring personal experience in this fast paced time where doctors dont have more than a few minutes to spare.",

We continue to keep in touch with Mam and wish all the success for her future endeavours. \nComing back to India from UK after such a prolonged stay is commendable we hope she expands her clinic while continuing her friendly yet professional medical services for years to come.",

She follows ethical practise and charges reasonably for consultation. Money is not on her agenda when talking to a patient. She is patient friendly and a well wisher.

No matter how worried we are, her composed way of dealing with the patients and the confidence she holds will make you feel that you are in safe hands. Another biggest strength is her spouse Dr.Leonard sir he is an amazing radiologist who holds a vast knowledge. He explains the details in such a positive way that any couple will cherish the moment (of scanning). Both of them are so compactable which gives positive vibes.. Her staffs in London Harley clinic are so kind. Special note to the staff Divya.   Thank you so much Doctor & team.. with all Ur support & positivety we are now a happy parents with the will of almighty. If anyone in OMR is looking for a caring & humble doctor and one who values our feelings then pls reach out to Dr. Parimalam & Leonard team..",

I had a previous case of stillbirth C-section and was extremely anxious throughout my pregnancy. Dr.Parimalam was well aware of this and did everything to ease this anxiety. All tests and scans were done to rule out any possibility of things going wrong. Extreme care was taken since it was a high risk pregnancy. Dr. Is easily approachable through phone, WhatsApp and even calls back in case she misses a call, very friendly and she kept reassuring me enough to put me at ease. I have to mention Dr.Leonard here who did all the scans, I think I have never understood scans so well ever before this. I already have a son and had scan experiences before but this was a different experience altogether and the best. Even post pregnancy I had lot of issues but all were well taken care of.. I had my daughter in December and I am really grateful to have found these extremely caring and efficient doctors. Thank you so much practo for letting me find Dr.Parimalam.",

She is very ************* ***  friendly. Dr guides you with every information on pre and post pregnancy(Diet, supplementation, birth certificate, RCH #). She aims for a normal delivery as much as possible and uses other methods as a last resort. Dr also guided us to choose the right hospital for delivery(In our case Apollo Cradle, Karapakkam)\n\nDr. Leonard who is a consultant Radiologist in the clinic does most of the growth scan of the fetus. He is crystal clear in his explanations and tells you the importance of each scan and why each scan is performed. He works in England and Chennai. \n\nThe London Harley Clinic is very neat and clean and the staff is very professional and friendly. We are very THANKFUL to each and every one of them at London Harley. They helped and guided us to bring our Little son to our lives. Thank you very much!!!\n\n",

Then I called my cousin who is a opthamologist in UK working in Birmingham and asked about her suggestion. She searched online and told me that Dr parimalam has genuine UK qualification with FRCOG and CCT which is only recognized training to  work as unsupervised consultant in major developed countries.Then I came to know that she was a  fertility  consultant in one of the premier hospital in London \nI met her in London Harley street women and fertility centre which is behind Apollo hospital, perungudi. I spoke to madam in phone for getting appointment . To my surprise I can feel the british accent . She is so polite and gave me the appointment on same day in her busy schedule as I have to travel back to Dubai. \nIn my first visit she explained everything in detail about the treatment plan for my fertility problem. She also recommended me to one of the major hospital in dubal where her London colleague works. She phoned her in front of me and discussed my situation. Thanks to Dr parimalam madam for her advice. I am going to have all the preliminary test in dubal and will be back to Chennai for IVF with madam, if required as it is very costly in dubai and no insurance claim for IVF.",

She spoke to me patiently on the phone, and comforted me on the way to the clinic. And as soon as we got there and we could find the heart beat of both the babies, the couple genuinely rejoiced with us like they were our own family.  \n\nSo thankful for the care and support they have shown. Will always be grateful  \ud83d\ude4f",

She was very responsive to any concerns throughout the journey. She even answered my call in the midnight when i went into labor and rushed to the hospital within no time. Had a very smooth childbirth experience only because of her. She is very talented and knows what she is doing. I would definitely recommend her to anyone i know.",

Healthy delivery happened only because of her. Also  during the pregnancy period, we faced many issues and all the doctors we met were negative but only Parimalam Dr gave was positive. Her positive energy made thing happen in the right way.\n\nWe are very thankful to her and we recommend her for all.\n\nThanks",

I was pregnant again.\n\nWe were very concerned as age was another factor. Since we work in Healthcare sector, I was worried about being in SAFE hands. I was OK when I met her first and the subsequent meetings made me feel comfortable and sure that I was in safe hands. \n\nShe is indeed very down to earth, approachable,  very detailed in her diagnosis. Her regular check ups and detailed explanation makes you feel at ease. I did not realize how 9 months flew... \n\nI am now a mother of another beautiful baby girl :)\nThanks to doctor and her staff for everything,!",

We first met a junior doctor who was friendly and caring to listen to and understand the whole medical history of my wife. Then we met Dr. Parimalam who gave the prompt feedback regarding the issues and what might have caused the issues. We are very happy with her consultation, approach, explanation offered, etc. Her experience really helps in the proper diagnosis. My wife is a nurse and even she felt the doctors recommendation was to the point. I recommend Dr. Parimalam to my friends. ",

But from Practo, I came to know about Dr. Parimalam and directly walked in to her Clinic (London Harley Street Fertility Center). She took time to hear about the problem and analysed the issue. On our 2nd visit, she suggested us to use natural ways instead of further medicies as they are worsening the infection. So as we started using Butter and Yogurt as suggested by her, we could able to see a good progess and gradual reduction in the infection. Thanks to her and I recommend her for all other Womens problems as well.",

But practo is unable to put different fees for fertility and general gynaecology consultations. Only one in 5 consultations are for fertility and other cases come for general gynaecology and pregnancy checkups etc.  Hence it is not fair to put rs 700for all cases including general gynaecology. \nO\nI reviewed your notes that I have elicited a detailed history almost for 45minutes for the initial workup of fertility treatments. Fertility problems need a lot of time and the patients have to be approached sensitively. Hence I spend a time and note the intricate details that is the reason why we have a high success rates compared to others. \n\nI noted your comments regarding the charging for the medicines more money than the MRP which is completely wrong. \nI would advise you to approach us with the details of how much you were charged and if we have charged more than the MRP, we are happy to refund the money back. You can see the MRP in the tablet packing itself.  We are not charging extra over the MRP. ",
