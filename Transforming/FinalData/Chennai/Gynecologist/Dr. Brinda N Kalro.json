I took acupuncture sessions from her and that  had really helped my anxiety, depression , emotional stress issues . After each session, i felt absolutely amazing  and now after 7+ acupuncture sessions I would say it made me a better person both physically and mentally.Now I definitely believe in acupuncture and I recommend to everyone ",
