,,0,0,YES,"Dr Radhika was very reassuring to talk to about my problem and surgery. She was very patient and encouraging throughout the process, answered questions very clearly without jargon. She was amazing as my surgeon. A post op spike in pain I had was due to a nursing oversight but she was caring and still monitoring the situation alertly. Neat, clean surgery that I recovered with fully without any trouble or infection. She didn't palm me off to a side kick and was very easy to reach - you didn't need to wait for days for each appointment. She is a really excellent gynecologist, I've been recommending her to all the women I know after my experience. Oh and very transparent and honest also: you know that you're doing only the necessary tests, she also gives you full choice for where to do testing or surgery explaining pros and cons, without any pressure.",2024-06-01 01:46:31,False,True,M R,,,

,,0,0,YES,"I met Dr. Radhika during my annual health checkup. My gynaec issue was more of a discomfort then, hence never sought a permanent solution. She clarified the pros and cons of  possible solutions in a scientific yet practical manner. She gave me the confidence to undergo a laproscopic surgery with multiple benefits that it seemed the right thing to do. She was always reachable by whatsapp and cleared all our doubts. Surgery dates were conveniently booked, well planned and executed flawlessly. Post op recovery was excellent with no issues, walking in 2 days as promised by her.  Never took any referral or second opinion. Decision was easy, as all it needed was faith and she gave that in plenty. Thank you Dr. Radhika. ",2022-11-13 02:04:36,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

,,0,0,YES,"We met Dr. G. Radhika actually for the second opinion. She went through our medical records and advised us in a short and sweet way without panicking us about my health hazard - multiple fibroids requiring immediate hysterectomy surgery. She gave us balanced advice before, during and after the surgery to me and my family. The teething troubles we encountered were well handled by doctor mam with immediate response through WhatsApp and phone calls with down-to-earth positive attitude with actual facts. We forget our worries of illness with her kindness and smiling face. The most dependable doctor we have ever seen.",2022-10-02 16:44:41,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
