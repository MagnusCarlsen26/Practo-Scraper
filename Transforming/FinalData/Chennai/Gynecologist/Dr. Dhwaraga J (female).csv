,,0,0,YES,***** ** *** *** ** *** ****** ****** Practical and sensitive approach towards her patients. My entire pregnancy from Day 1 till i came home was so smooth.

She keeps you calm and also helps handle the new situations as pregnant lady and as new mother. **** ******* * **** **** ******* I feel lucky to have met her in my most crucial stage of life.

,,0,0,YES,"I had irregular periods and some other issues and consulted to her. She asked for some tests and all and revisited her again. She explained to me everything in detail and the best part about her is that she gives so much time to each patient and empathetic enough to make it feel more personal than being a doctor. Whatever she asked me to do, I have been following it and I can see the difference in myself. **** ************* *** expert in her domain.",2023-10-11 10:26:09,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
