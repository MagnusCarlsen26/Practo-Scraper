She coordinated with Apollo Hospital to book the OT and other required facilities and did the surgery at Apollo Hospital.  She has been of immense support to me , all along the treatment.  She was always available for discussions and to give us all guidance.  Because of the kind of care she provided, we felt like we were dealing with a family member.\n\nThere are no words to thank the doctor, for whatever care & support, that she has been giving to me all along the treatment.

One feels so comfortable at the very first visit itself,that you open up your problems with much ease to her. She has been of immense support to me , all along the treatment. Her empathy is commendable and the positivity she emotes, have always made me develop a positive outlook. She was always available, in times of need. I am blessed to have the treatment under her. There are no words to thank the doctor, for whatever care & support, that she has been giving to me all along the treatment. I would 100% recommend Dr. Bobby for all the gyne problems. I wish \nDr. Bobby all success.",

Must recommended Dr in Chennai. I m super satisfied with my treatment and will rate her the best. ",

Her knowledge is not limited to her specialisation field and she keeps her enriched in other areas also which helps her to understand, analyse and treat the patients accordingly. She doesn't prescribe medicines unnecessarily and tends to solve all the health issues reported in broad aspects. I was suffering from recurrent unknown fever in the recent past and she took utmost care by referring some of the renowned Drs in Chennai who treated me and saved my life. She regularly followed up with those Drs and suggested ways to improve my health. My heartfelt thanks to her and I strongly recommend to visit her for Gynae problems.",
