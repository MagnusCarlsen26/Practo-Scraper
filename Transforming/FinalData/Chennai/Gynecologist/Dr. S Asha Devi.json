But Dr. Asha Devi mam explained everything so well that all worries vanished and my wife became confident enough for the big day. The friendly behavior and caring approach during every consultation is what we liked very much. She took care of my wife very well right from our confirmation of pregnancy until our discharge from the hospital. She was available on call whenever we had any queries even during the night times. She provided all the details about the hospital admission and arranged for our admissions herself personally. This definitely reduced our worries which usually happens during any hospital admissions. We would like to thank her from our hearts for making this journey memorable and smooth for us. I would recommend Dr. Asha Devi mam to anyone seeking a kind, compassionate, and brilliant doctor.",

Trust me I became confident enough to read and understand all the scan reports because of Asha mam. \n\nShe will be available always to help you via video call or chat.

The style of her work and handling the patients - mind blowing I must say. I am more than happy to be her patient. \n\nThe hospital that I was admitted to, needs a lot of credit as well. Extremely friendly staff, neatness, hygiene were all perfect to the dot. \n\nIn the last two days, every single person I met, has treated me with a smile.

But Dr. Asha Devi mam explained everything so well that all worries vanished and my wife became confident enough for the big day. The friendly behavior and caring approach during every consultation is what we liked very much. She took care of my wife very well right from our confirmation of pregnancy until our discharge from the hospital. She was available on call whenever we had any queries even during the night times. She provided all the details about the hospital admission and arranged for our admissions herself personally. This definitely reduced our worries which usually happens during any hospital admissions. We would like to thank her from our hearts for making this journey memorable and smooth for us. I would recommend Dr. Asha Devi mam to anyone seeking a kind, compassionate, and brilliant doctor.",

Trust me I became confident enough to read and understand all the scan reports because of Asha mam. \n\nShe will be available always to help you via video call or chat.

But this is one such that needs to be treasured in my heart. *** ** ** *** *** **** ****** * **** **** ************ Friendliness cannot be gauged by just ratings. The style of her work and handling the patients - mind blowing I must say. I am more than happy to be her patient. \n\nThe hospital that I was admitted to, needs a lot of credit as well. Extremely friendly staff, neatness, hygiene were all perfect to the dot. \n\nIn the last two days, every single person I met, has treated me with a smile. I have absolutely loved everything about the entire process I went through. \n\nThanking Asha and her crew from the bottom of my heart. \u2665\ufe0f",

Because when God wants to do something good for us, He will take us to them at the right time and He will do that good and miracle for us through them. That wonderful human is Dr.Ashadevi. We had a girl baby in 2012. Then we tried for a second child and did not conceive. We have seen many doctors to no avail. Finally We met Dr.Ashadevi. A belief was born for us on the first day. I told my wife that good things are going to happen to us through them. Because of the trust they gave us, the way they spoke. They guided us with so much kindness and smiling faces. They will patiently explain things that we do not understand. We patiently traveled with them for two years and finally the miracle happened. We gave birth to a beautiful boy baby on 10.04.2023. Every day I thank God and Ashadevi madam in my heart. May God bless them and may they live many years. Many people like me should benefit from them. They have got gold medal in medical course. There are many more awards to be won by them. It is our wish that they should have a big \"Multispecialty hospital\" of their own. Thank you Madam. GOD BLESS YOU.",

When I was pregnant for my second child I was told to do amniocentesis test as they suspected to have a down syndrome child. Me and my husband were very confused whether to take this test or not as this test is a very risky one. But the doctor supported me a lot during that time. She told that I will not have any problem as I am very young and don't have a family history too. She told me to take the test without any worry and we had taken the test. At that time I call her many times and she picked my call and answered to my every question and at times she told me even to come directly to her clinic* ***** **** * **** ****** *** ** * **** **** ***** ***** ***** *** ** *** *** ******** My results are negative. And now my second son is three and a half years old now. Thanks to the doctor. May God bless her  her family and her children. ",
