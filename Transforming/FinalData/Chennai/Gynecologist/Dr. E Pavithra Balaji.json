She is one of a kind *** * ****** *** *** ** *** ** *** **** ******* * **** **** **** ****** * She is so patient, down to earth , very positive and such a good listener. I was able to ask and discuss with her silliest of my concerns and she would patiently respond to me . She guided me perfectly throughout my pregnancy, she exactly knows what to do and  I was able to deliver my baby with the  least of the complications. I was a bit nervous during my pregnancy period but every time I visit her during my check ups she cheers me up with tons of positivity and every single  time I come out of her room with a smiling face. And tell me which doctor these days give their personal number to us and responds to us immediately even for the text message we send !!! Thank you so much mam for everything and sending loads of love . Thank you once again for being u and doing what you are doing .!!!!",

Last 7 months back, it was diagnosed as PCOS and I was very upset and depressed about this issue enquired in my body. Thereafter, I found Pavithra mam on google web source and visited at her place Nungambakkam. I discussed all my problems and primarly, she has given a positive and moral support including medications. The place Nunambakkam was very far from my home and she suggested not to come here, I also do practice in Sugam Hospital, Tambaram. She took care  all my expenses spent for travelling from my home to Nungambakkam. Then, I visited to the suggested Hospital and met her for the issue. She always give moral support before prescription of the medicines, that I like most. After 7 months treatment, I am permanently cured from her treatment/medication, positive attutide and  moral support.  This time, no cysts seen in both the ovaries.  After God, I am again more thankful to Mam. The best thing is that she does not ask to go for more number of blood test, she suggested only the required test and saved our money. During this pandemic, I was stuck at my native place in north indian region and she always been in contact on phone at all the time. She always put attention on her patients and give positive response. Even if you are late on your scheduled time, she can wait and see her patients in all possible ways. I feel more proud to be a patient of Dr Pavithra Mam, and recommend to all those who are wasting their time here and there in other hospitals. Please visit at once and you will feel whatever I said, its 100% true. Once again thank to God who has chosen Dr Pavithra mam to resolve my medical problem. Thank you Mam.  ",

When i saw her first time i got little scared about madam experience but when i came out from hospital i was completely satisfied of madam's positive speech and kindness so i felt more confidence and strength . Madam won't call us un necessarily to hospital for other than mandatory scan and other test which is required for pregnant lady. If any doubt arise i used to call Madam over the phone and always madam responds to me. For my first baby i was hospitalised for 6 days and for complete recovery it was around a month.  Had taken more medicines also but for my 2 nd baby i got discharged in third day and this time i underwent sterilisation also and i completely recovered in 2 weeks but i have taken less medicine this time. She is always listening us first then giving treatment or suggessions as a friend as a well wisher, half of the illness will be cured by her positive speech. I cannot say simply thanks to madam but words are not enough to describe. If anybody wants to go for normal delivery i will prefer Pavithra Madam( Our Angel).",

She is one of a kind *** * ****** *** *** ** *** ** *** **** ******* * **** **** **** ****** * She is so patient, down to earth , very positive and such a good listener. I was able to ask and discuss with her silliest of my concerns and she would patiently respond to me . She guided me perfectly throughout my pregnancy, she exactly knows what to do and  I was able to deliver my baby with the  least of the complications. I was a bit nervous during my pregnancy period but every time I visit her during my check ups she cheers me up with tons of positivity and every single  time I come out of her room with a smiling face. And tell me which doctor these days give their personal number to us and responds to us immediately even for the text message we send !!! Thank you so much mam for everything and sending loads of love . Thank you once again for being u and doing what you are doing .!!!!",

Last 7 months back, it was diagnosed as PCOS and I was very upset and depressed about this issue enquired in my body. Thereafter, I found Pavithra mam on google web source and visited at her place Nungambakkam. I discussed all my problems and primarly, she has given a positive and moral support including medications. The place Nunambakkam was very far from my home and she suggested not to come here, I also do practice in Sugam Hospital, Tambaram. She took care  all my expenses spent for travelling from my home to Nungambakkam. Then, I visited to the suggested Hospital and met her for the issue. She always give moral support before prescription of the medicines, that I like most. After 7 months treatment, I am permanently cured from her treatment/medication, positive attutide and  moral support.  This time, no cysts seen in both the ovaries.  After God, I am again more thankful to Mam. The best thing is that she does not ask to go for more number of blood test, she suggested only the required test and saved our money. During this pandemic, I was stuck at my native place in north indian region and she always been in contact on phone at all the time. She always put attention on her patients and give positive response. Even if you are late on your scheduled time, she can wait and see her patients in all possible ways. I feel more proud to be a patient of Dr Pavithra Mam, and recommend to all those who are wasting their time here and there in other hospitals. Please visit at once and you will feel whatever I said, its 100% true. Once again thank to God who has chosen Dr Pavithra mam to resolve my medical problem. Thank you Mam.  ",

When i saw her first time i got little scared about madam experience but when i came out from hospital i was completely satisfied of madam's positive speech and kindness so i felt more confidence and strength . Madam won't call us un necessarily to hospital for other than mandatory scan and other test which is required for pregnant lady. If any doubt arise i used to call Madam over the phone and always madam responds to me. For my first baby i was hospitalised for 6 days and for complete recovery it was around a month.  Had taken more medicines also but for my 2 nd baby i got discharged in third day and this time i underwent sterilisation also and i completely recovered in 2 weeks but i have taken less medicine this time. She is always listening us first then giving treatment or suggessions as a friend as a well wisher, half of the illness will be cured by her positive speech. I cannot say simply thanks to madam but words are not enough to describe. If anybody wants to go for normal delivery i will prefer Pavithra Madam( Our Angel).",
