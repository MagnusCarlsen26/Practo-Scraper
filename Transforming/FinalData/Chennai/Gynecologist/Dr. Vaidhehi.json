After Yogasalini mam resignation i was consulting Vaidhehi mam with lots of doubts and clarification and got afraid how my delivery would go. But undoubtedly Dr.Vaidhehi mam was just amazing with clearing all my doubts and clarification patiently and handled my BP issues through out my last trimester. And when my water got broke and i reached ER care with lots of fears on my mind . But Vaidhehi mam team immediately responded and started their medication process and gave hope to trust my body and induce labor induction. After 6hrs of labor induction even i lost my confidence to bear the pain but labor ward night staff nurses and Gync team gave me the trust to induce the labor more effectively. And labor ward morning staff were really supported me through their patience when i was in my last 2 to 3hrs of labor even on my intense pain. And at the last half and hour i really don't have the strength to push my baby out but really Dr.Vaidhehi mam and the staff nurses are like saviors to motivate me to push my baby out even on the intense pain. I would really thank Dr.Vaidhehi mam and the staff nurses and Housekeeping akka from the bottom of myheart who were during my labor. Anyone can treat patient for the money they spent for their treatment but when we are going through the pain there should be somebody to gave hope to trust our body throughout the medication process and that's how Dr.Vaidhehi mam team did that successfully and deliver my baby through Vaginal delivery even when i lose all my hope and asked them for C-section. Thanks would not be the one word which i would appreciate Dr.Vaidhehi Mam team. They are Saviors to deliver our little bundle of joy.",

In terms of knowledge she is all that you can hope for. \nShe takes cares of her patients like a mother to her children. We were requested Normal delivery during our consultations.  She did all that was possible, supported during the entire pregnancy and finally my wife delivered a baby boy by normal delivery. \n\nThe highlight is she turned up at night 9 clock during the labour,stayed throughout the process till midnight 12. The support and comfort she gave to my wife was overwhelming. Only with her support we were able to get the baby through normal delivery.  During the entire midnight her 10months old daughter was with her in hospital. \nWe went to her only after seeing the positive reviews and I am so happy to share my positive review on the same platform.  Thank you Tons doctor!!",

I would rate 4/5 Unittas reception was very worst even if the doctor had asked to come for a scan when I enquired the receptionist was telling no scan availability which is diverting, whenever I call no response if they call back but they never call back to us. Even waiting time if also no one is there they were like ecool they don't call the doctor they will be always chit-chatting I was very pissed of with the reception so I just stopped going there because I travel a long way nearly 30km every day to visit the hospital I literally come back home by 10 pm that\u2019s the worst service they give.

After Yogasalini mam resignation i was consulting Vaidhehi mam with lots of doubts and clarification and got afraid how my delivery would go. But undoubtedly Dr.Vaidhehi mam was just amazing with clearing all my doubts and clarification patiently and handled my BP issues through out my last trimester. And when my water got broke and i reached ER care with lots of fears on my mind . But Vaidhehi mam team immediately responded and started their medication process and gave hope to trust my body and induce labor induction. After 6hrs of labor induction even i lost my confidence to bear the pain but labor ward night staff nurses and Gync team gave me the trust to induce the labor more effectively. And labor ward morning staff were really supported me through their patience when i was in my last 2 to 3hrs of labor even on my intense pain. And at the last half and hour i really don't have the strength to push my baby out but really Dr.Vaidhehi mam and the staff nurses are like saviors to motivate me to push my baby out even on the intense pain. I would really thank Dr.Vaidhehi mam and the staff nurses and Housekeeping akka from the bottom of myheart who were during my labor. Anyone can treat patient for the money they spent for their treatment but when we are going through the pain there should be somebody to gave hope to trust our body throughout the medication process and that's how Dr.Vaidhehi mam team did that successfully and deliver my baby through Vaginal delivery even when i lose all my hope and asked them for C-section. Thanks would not be the one word which i would appreciate Dr.Vaidhehi Mam team. They are Saviors to deliver our little bundle of joy.",

In terms of knowledge she is all that you can hope for. \nShe takes cares of her patients like a mother to her children. We were requested Normal delivery during our consultations.  She did all that was possible, supported during the entire pregnancy and finally my wife delivered a baby boy by normal delivery. \n\nThe highlight is she turned up at night 9 clock during the labour,stayed throughout the process till midnight 12. The support and comfort she gave to my wife was overwhelming. Only with her support we were able to get the baby through normal delivery.  During the entire midnight her 10months old daughter was with her in hospital. \nWe went to her only after seeing the positive reviews and I am so happy to share my positive review on the same platform.

She was listening to my problems. My first consultation was good, she did give me time to hear my problems. I would rate 4/5 Unittas reception was very worst even if the doctor had asked to come for a scan when I enquired the receptionist was telling no scan availability which is diverting, whenever I call no response if they call back but they never call back to us. Even waiting time if also no one is there they were like ecool they don't call the doctor they will be always chit-chatting I was very pissed of with the reception so I just stopped going there because I travel a long way nearly 30km every day to visit the hospital I literally come back home by 10 pm that\u2019s the worst service they give.
