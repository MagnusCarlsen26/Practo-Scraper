"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,* **** ************* *** dedicated doctor. She is so patient and gives you enough time to talk about the problems and it's worth waiting for your number. She handles the usual checkups so perfectly and makes you feel absolutely comfortable. I can't forget when she almost reached dwarka after checking on me.. suddenly my vitals went bad..which was serious for the baby..on a call by the staff..she drove back to fortis to be there in 20 minutes for my delivery which couldn't be delayed.  I was terribly scared.. shivering.. but then I saw her and she held my hand saying don't worry the baby will be fine..I had tears but a trust that she is there kept me stable.. recommend her to all.. go ahead without any doubts. You are in the safest hands.,2020-05-28 04:08:04,False,True,Tuhin Mehrotra,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Thanks to Dr Shilpa for helping me give birth to a baby boy.

I visited her only in the 8th month of my pregnancy. She is very friendly, highly experienced and explains all queries very well.

While I hear most of my friends and relatives having to go for C-section in recent times, i am very grateful to doctor for her patience and determination that helped me to go for normal delivery, despite having problems of gestational hypertension and asthma, due to which i couldnt take certain medications for induction of labor. But it was her experience due to which things proceeded well despite the existing health issues.",2023-05-31 03:13:57,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
