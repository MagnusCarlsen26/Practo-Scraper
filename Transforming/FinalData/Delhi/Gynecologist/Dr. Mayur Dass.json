I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for your exceptional care and expertise during the delivery of our precious baby .Your dedication and skill made all the difference, ensuring a safe and successful delivery for both me and my baby. \n\nYour calming presence and reassuring words throughout the entire process were immensely comforting, easing any anxiety and instilling confidence in your abilities. Your commitment to providing the highest standard of care is truly commendable, and we feel incredibly fortunate to have had you as our obstetrician.\nI can say in East Delhi she is the best obstretrician for many reason - very positive attitude , motivating all the way , caring like a family member rather than a random patient , her words are so humble and polite all he way & she always tries her best to co-ordinate & sort out every piece of issues (i like this the most) .\n\nWords can't adequately convey our appreciation for everything Dr.Dass has done for us. Thank you for your unwavering support, compassion, and professionalism. You have played an integral role in bringing our little miracle into the world, and for that, we will be forever grateful.Thank you for going above and beyond to ensure the safety and well-being of both me and my baby. Your commitment to excellence is truly inspiring, and we feel incredibly fortunate to have had you by our side during this incredible journey into parenthood.\n\nI've never ever searched for any alternatives ( in the beginning / mid way ) as I feel she is the best doctor for me whom I'm consulting . \n\nWith deepest gratitude and admiration,\nChinmayee",

Your baby will be in safe hands...!!",

Even at late nights or early mornings too, she will definitely pick your call and reply to your whats app queries when online.\n\nShe sometimes do scold you as an elder sister which is always welcome as we being a novice in this field so asking basic questions was acceptable since this was our 1st child and there is a different excitement in us and our family.\n\nShe is always supportive, polite and would clear your doubts patiently with no hurry of seeing more patients in queue . \n\nOur baby is 6 months old now, we still do meet her sometimes at her  clinic or cloud9 hospital to wish her which is always a wonderful experience. \n\nI will definitely recommend this doctor to everyone who is reading my comments singing off .\n\nI will give her ****** (6 stars/5 stars ).\n\nThanks & Regards,\nBaby Anayra Kapur  \nRakhi Kapur &\nAnirudh Kapur \n\n",

Dr Mayur has a very enriched experience and an excellent pedigree. She is always approachable and answer to all your queries patiently \n\n2. I believe for any person a \u2018Doctor - Patient\u2019 connect is pertinent and Dr Mayur always provide that emotional connect. There were occasions when she has gone beyond her call of duty and even counselled us as well. I think that\u2019s a great service behaviour in this noble profession \n\n3. We felt, Dr Mayur don\u2019t ask for multiple visits unless it is absolutely required and that could give you sense of trust and satisfaction \n\n\nWhether you have an ailment or you are an expecting/aspiring parents then I would strongly recommend you to visit Dr Mayur",

She genuinely seems to care about her each patients like a family member. My wife was very much keen for normal delivery and she assured us for that and it actully happened. She was very much concern for a normal then us. At the time of delivery as well she was present all the time for consultation and care. Even her Clinic was nicely maintained and well organized as well. \n\nWe really liked her treatment and we will cwrtainly  refer her to all of our friends and family.

I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for your exceptional care and expertise during the delivery of our precious baby .Your dedication and skill made all the difference, ensuring a safe and successful delivery for both me and my baby. \n\nYour calming presence and reassuring words throughout the entire process were immensely comforting, easing any anxiety and instilling confidence in your abilities. Your commitment to providing the highest standard of care is truly commendable, and we feel incredibly fortunate to have had you as our obstetrician.\nI can say in East Delhi she is the best obstretrician for many reason - very positive attitude , motivating all the way , caring like a family member rather than a random patient , her words are so humble and polite all he way & she always tries her best to co-ordinate & sort out every piece of issues (i like this the most) .\n\nWords can't adequately convey our appreciation for everything Dr.Dass has done for us. Thank you for your unwavering support, compassion, and professionalism. You have played an integral role in bringing our little miracle into the world, and for that, we will be forever grateful.Thank you for going above and beyond to ensure the safety and well-being of both me and my baby. Your commitment to excellence is truly inspiring, and we feel incredibly fortunate to have had you by our side during this incredible journey into parenthood.\n\nI've never ever searched for any alternatives ( in the beginning / mid way ) as I feel she is the best doctor for me whom I'm consulting . \n\nWith deepest gratitude and admiration,\nChinmayee",

Your baby will be in safe hands...!!",

Even at late nights or early mornings too, she will definitely pick your call and reply to your whats app queries when online.\n\nShe sometimes do scold you as an elder sister which is always welcome as we being a novice in this field so asking basic questions was acceptable since this was our 1st child and there is a different excitement in us and our family.\n\nShe is always supportive, polite and would clear your doubts patiently with no hurry of seeing more patients in queue . \n\nOur baby is 6 months old now, we still do meet her sometimes at her  clinic or cloud9 hospital to wish her which is always a wonderful experience. \n\nI will definitely recommend this doctor to everyone who is reading my comments singing off .\n\nI will give her ****** (6 stars/5 stars ).\n\nThanks & Regards,\nBaby Anayra Kapur  \nRakhi Kapur &\nAnirudh Kapur \n\n",

Dr Mayur has a very enriched experience and an excellent pedigree. She is always approachable and answer to all your queries patiently \n\n2. I believe for any person a \u2018Doctor - Patient\u2019 connect is pertinent and Dr Mayur always provide that emotional connect. There were occasions when she has gone beyond her call of duty and even counselled us as well. I think that\u2019s a great service behaviour in this noble profession \n\n3. We felt, Dr Mayur don\u2019t ask for multiple visits unless it is absolutely required and that could give you sense of trust and satisfaction \n\n\nWhether you have an ailment or you are an expecting/aspiring parents then I would strongly recommend you to visit Dr Mayur",

She never asked for visit until necessarily.. There have been so many sayings from different family members on what to eat and what not and I used to ask her.. She never stopped me to eat anything except papaya.. Just that moderation is the key.. I had all the fruits being a fruit lover.. and Mangoes too in summers and I delivered a healthy baby... Thanks to her.. \nThough we tried our best, I had a c-section.. I wish Max Parpadganj has the technology of delivering baby though vacuum... I do had the complications in stitches for some reason but Dr Mayur was always there 24/7. ",

To start with, the wait time was huge, the clinic was a very confined space with no privacy from other patients waiting outside while we discussed our case with the doctor.  Secondly, after listening to my case, she reacted in a very un-empathatic way and scared us a lot for what all bad can happen to us again for the next pregnancy, and provided a list of many tests (worth around 40K) to be done in her lab next door, and to start the medications. I was so distressed after the appointment, she almost made me cry with all the negativity she shared. Thankfully we did not go ahead with her suggestion and visited another very senior doctor in Cloudnine, who advised us correctly and was helpful unlike her.",

Dr. Mayur's Clinic was nicely maintained and well organized as well. \n\nI liked her treatment and I refer her to all of my friends and colleagues.  Dr. Mayur  is very down-to-earth, a great listener and Highly recommend her.",

She is very polite and was always reachable on call, chat during whole period.\n\nDoctor has already told us that there is a better chance of normal delivery. At the time of delivery we were very panicked & nervous and were thinking about operation but Dr Mayur handled the whole situation wonderfully and we were gifted with a baby boy, by the blessing of the God, in Dec-2020 through Normal Delivery.\u00a0Post delivery also the Doctor was always reachable and guided properly.

Before visiting her, we visited several specialists, but none of them able to help us. But Dr. Mayur Dass not only assured us to get better treatment but also promised to us that she will give us a healthy baby if we follow her instructions. We followed word to word as she said. And finally she gave us a healthy baby boy in our lap. She is amazing!! Thank you so much ma'am. May God gives to everything in your life what you want. 1000% recommended. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude01",
