Mind you, no doctor visisted her in the ER even once or no medicines administered..even paracetomal was not given to her for 4 hours when her fever was reported to be 103 degress at admission. Finally i got her discharged against medical advice as doctors did not want to releass her despite not attending to her. Apparently ER costs are charged per hour. Cherry on the cake was a cost of Rs.9800 for ***** blood test for stomach infection which we had to pay in order to get discharge. *** **** ***** **** ***** ****** **** **** ******* **** ** *** ***** ********* *** ** ************ HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER DECENT OPTION. ****** ** ** * ********** ********* **** **** ****** *********** ******* *** ****** ******* ***** ****** *** **** * ****** ******** ** * ******* **** *****.I personally dont mind paying if i get proportionate and quality service which is nonexistent in this case.",
