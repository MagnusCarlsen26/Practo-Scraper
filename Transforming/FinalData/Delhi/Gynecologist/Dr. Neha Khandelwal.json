From the day one I met her I was confident that my journey of pregnancy will be in very very experienced and proficient hands !\nDuring my pregnancy journey, i was inquisitive and had a list with all sorts of questions written in my phone notes in my each and every visit and she answered it all with so much ease.\nWe tried having normal delivery till last minute but eventually had to go through C sec for my baby's betterment. I remember while in OT also she was still regularly monitoring if I can still have normal delivery.\nMy words cannot express how grateful I am to her as she has given me my second life in the form of motherhood and she knows how important this baby is to me.\nThank you Doctor for always being there for all of us",

Her approach to her parenthood is so simple and easy to follow with no additional baggage. She was so easily accessible for any questions which are so common when you are a first time parent. She answered all our questions with utmost sincerity and calmness.  We ended up having a C section however she tried to make it as smooth as possible.  And, thanks to her, we welcomed our Baby Boy on 17th April. Thank you Dr. Neha for all that you have done for us. Both me and my baby boy are happy and healthy thanks to your guidance",

We are elated and excited to share with you the birth of our baby boy on 12th Feb, our bundle of joy\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\n\nThe journey for the last 9 months has been the most beautiful experience of my life. In the first week itself, we could feel that we might have conceived. Since we live outside India so we straight away went to Doctor and the doctor confirmed to us that we were pregnant. Because of covid-19 issues, our families were not able to join us there so we from the start had planned the birth of our child In New Delhi. The pregnancy went well for five and half months when I traveled back to Delhi. By then I had checked with friends and thoroughly googled the best pregnancy doctor in Delhi. \n\n\nI met Dr. Neha Khandelwal in my 26th month and with the first visit, I felt the relief that we have come to the right place. Dr. Neha guided us in every possible way, the transition from one doctor to another was smooth and during this whole time, I didn\u2019t have any anxious moments.\n\n\nWe followed Dr. Neha\u2019s each and every instruction religiously and till the approach of the ninth month, everything went smooth. On my 35th week, I developed symptoms of cough and fever, as suspected I tested positive for covid-19. I immediately contacted Dr. Neha. She reassured me that everything is going to be fine with instructions on how to take care of pregnancy with covid. A couple of days were stressful and everyone at home looked anxious. By God\u2019s grace, my fever disappeared on 2nd day itself and it felt like a great relief. It took me 3-4 days more to completely recover and by the 5th day I felt completely fine.\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\n\n\nWe visited Doctor in the 37th Week and Dr. Neha told me to prepare the baby and body for the birth. Dr. Neha\u2019s instructions regarding diet and exercises were very effective. Even though the target date for going into labor was 23rd Feb, my water broke on 11th Feb. We called Dr. Neha and Dr instructed us to come to the hospital immediately. By the time I reached the hospital, I started feeling contractions. Soon I found Dr. Neha by my bedside and in the next 4 hours, I was having full-blown contractions. We from the start planned for normal delivery so Dr Neha prepared me and the hospital staff accordingly. So finally the time came and every person in the labor room was so encouraging and set to have the baby delivered normally. I pushed hard and we dr could see the head of baby. In next one hour, we tried our best to deliver the baby normally, but since baby\u2019s shoulders were not coming out so Dr. Neha took the call to go ahead for C\u2013section. I was transferred to OT and a little past after midnight, our sunshine was out in this world.\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\n\nOn the morning of 12th Feb we had a minor issue, we called Dr. Neha and found her again by my bedside in 30 minutes. It was amusing to see her so much concerned about our health and comfort. Dr. Neha\u2019s instructions are so clear and backed with complete information that it doesn\u2019t leave a shred of doubt in your mind. Now I can hold my baby in my hands and forget the rest of the world, and no words can explain that feeling.\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\n \nI wish you all happy and healthy pregnancy. Consider yourself lucky to be able to experience this journey. Special thanks to Dr. Neha Khandelwal, An Amazing Doctor, and such a wonderful human being.",

Apart from this, I had consulted her for some of my mother's concerns also and she is also doing fine and showing signs of improvement.

We are very lucky as we have found her based on google reviews but trust me , *** ** **** *** **** ***** **** *** *** *** ***** ******** Her way of treating naturally and keeping on minimal medicines has touched our hearts thats why we have taken the tough decision to come from Greater Noida to Kailash colony specially for Dr Neha. Then On 23rd April, we became proud on our decision , when only because of her I was able to deliver my baby boy normally. I still can\u2019t believe that I have delivered my baby normally but it happened only bcoz of Dr Neha\u2019s expertise and her team .",

I must say that Neha ma'am is truly a gem in my life as because of her persistent push for normal delivery, I managed to deliver the baby normally. I started consulting her in my 3rd month and right from my very first visit, I understood that she's the right person to bring my baby to this world. Her guidance and positivity helped me a lot during my pregnancy especially during the time when I was completely negative and was losing my mind because of mood swings. Her friendly advice not just as my doctor but as a mother herself gave me new hope and brought positivity in my pregnancy. On the day of my delivery, when I was unable to bear labour pain, i almost gave up and requested Neha Ma'am and her team multiple times to go for the C section but her team motivated me to have patience and deliver normally. They showed trust in me when i almost lost it. In Delivery room, she brought with herself so much positive energy which gave me strength to bear the pain and within mins, I managed to deliver our baby with a smiling face.\n It's all because of the efforts of Neha Ma'am and her team that today I am recovering so well and even the baby is doing well. I would also like to thank Cordinator Neha Ma'am who managed all the appointments so well and for always being so sweet.\nA piece of advice for all the new mothers to be - please follow Neha Ma'am's advice blindly and I assure, you all will give birth to a new life with flying colours.\n\nThank you Neha Ma'am for filling our life with happiness and joy of this cute little wonder and for all the guidance throughout our pregnancy. Our baby is really blessed to be born under the wings of such an Angel like you.\nThanks Ma'am\nPriya and Sumeet",

It was not possible without neha to deliver naturally.\n Sharing my parenting journey... We were searching for good hospital to deliver naturally. Started with holy family trust hospital which was a Bad. . Where nurses and doctor herself treat you like a professionl criminal.. Where you get shouted and become victim of doctors outrage without any reason. Remind you thats even when this trusted hospital charge similar to a private facility.\nThings took complete u turn when we got introduced to dr neha from one of acquaintance who had great experience. She is elite professional and provide crisp consultations on every visit. I remember on week  38 when in growth scan she identified something which could have caused fetal distress if we would havr waited for week 40. Thanks to dr neha and rainbows very detailed scan report. Believe me i have not seen such a report so detailed and captures all knitty grittes.\nThen the day came we were introduced to induced labor and it started. I remember dr neha came and advised me to take deep breatging and perforn lot of ball jumps whicg helped to open cervux from 3 to 6 cm.\ud83d\ude01\nAnd then her patience when our progress was little slow in last few hours. She waited and did every thing possible for natural delivery. With experience. Please follow what she says whether its normal or csection delivery she knows whats right for your baby and you.\nSpecial thanks to dr neha and team. Who focus first on healthy baby and then way of delivery.. This way i also never thought.\nWith my experience i have never encountered a dr who is so polite ad ready to go extra mile. I was wondering how come every one at rainbow so polite and ready to raise bar. Thanks to love from admin. All nurses from labor staff. Admin neha. Floor manager.. Housrkeeping staff. Food staff. Security folks. My family was flabbergasted to see every one so polite and every time they are readt raise bar ready to go extra mile when wr need them. My husband and family quoted when we visted here we never felt like a stereotyoe hispitals. Rather they call it rainbow heavinly swarg. Where everyone is like god. Thank you dr neha and team for your blessings.  I have never seen god but you are living goddess on earth. Thank you.",

So the search for best gynaecologists in South Delhi started as soon as we got to know that we have conceived. We preferred to go to doctors within 5-10 minute vicinity of our house, the doctors were good and quite reputed, however, I was never fully satisfied. Finally, we ended up our first consultation with Dr. Neha and soon after that I told my husband that I have finally found my doctor. From day 1, Dr. Neha focussed on the core issues:-\n1. Proper Diet and not over eating\n2. Exercises and Breathing\n3. Timely development of the baby\nApart from the above, I can\u2019t thank her enough for :-\n1. Her problem solving approach\n2. Approachability and promptness whenever you reach out to her.\nMy due date was 5th march, however, on 12th evening I noticed very slight water leakage. She asked to me go to the hospital in case it increases. 13th night I noticed the same thing so I contacted her on 14th early morning and she asked me to come for an immediate check up. During the check up, she asked me to get admitted. My husband got back home to get the hospital bag. On Valentine\u2019s afternoon started the process of labour induction and she guided me well how to keep on walking, doing ball exercises and breathing during contractions which started around 4 pm and gradually progressed. Next morning she met me at 8 am and by that time I was quite exhausted and quite close to giving up. Dr. asked me if I wanted an epidural and I asked her to take a call as she knows the best. By this time I was only 3 cm dilated. She told me to bear the pain for 1-1.5 hours and then we can take  a call on that as epidural at that stage would only increase the labour time. That 1-1.5 hours though most difficult but was the most magical, I was fully dilated within that time. Dr. Neha immediately came for the delivery and encouraged me so much alongwith the right guidance that I was able to do it in 3 pushes. Not to forget she made me do full squats 5 minutes prior to delivery during contractions. \ud83e\udd23 Thus, at 10.52 am on 15th morning, our lil champ was there with us and on 16th itself we were home, discharged- happy and healthy. :)\n\nGratitude for the efforts by the doctor and her team !!",

In our anxiety, we googled, 'the best gynaecologist in Delhi' and as the destiny would have it, we were sitting with Dr Neha that very day. Since that day, she has handled our case with utmost care and that kept reinforcing our faith in her.\nGradually, as the pregnancy progressed, the guidelines, suggestions, diet chart, exercises, medication were explained to us in great detail very patiently by her in each and every visit.\nIn my 35th week scan, we found our baby to be in breech position. We were suggested by people to take second opinion... But, we were firm in not approaching any second doctor and, Dr. Neha didn't let us lose hope and suggested some brilliant exercises. By 37th week, the baby was in head down position.. and believe me, Dr Neha seemed to be the happiest person on the planet.\nBut, God had his own plans, despite all chances being in our favour, we had to go for C-section due to some complications. I had to call her up at 5:30 in the morning and was not sure if she would take the call.. but, she did and kept her team ready at the hospital.\nDr Neha, stood by us rock-solid, and was willing to give us as much time as we wanted for normal delivery, and kept reiterating that, the method doesn't matter, vaginally or surgically, the end result, our baby should come out safe and kept pushing us towards a normal delivery till the very end, when we had to opt for c section as the last resort.\n\nSince it was my first pregnancy, I freaked out in the OT. And, Dr Neha kept pacifying me even during that time.\nI guess I have bothered Dr Neha too many a times and I feel I am obsessed with the way she handled our case.\nSo, without taking much time.. I would like to extend a BIG THANKYOU TO DOCTOR NEHA. WE SHALL BE HIGHLY THANKFUL TO YOU TODAY, TOMORROW AND ALWAYS.",

Our princess wanted to come a bit early in 34th week itself but through Dr.'s guidance, we could reach to 37th week and 1 day which was safe to deliver. Our lil angel came when it was totally unexpected and I had pre term contractions. With Dr. Neha's guidance, her team helped trace the unusual fluctuations in my baby's heartbeat and though she had pre planned a family event, she kept everything aside and was there with us to save my baby when we needed her the most. Trust me I was scared to see my angel's heartbeat fluctuations, but as soon as Dr.Neha Khandelwal arrived, it was quite a relief and from that very moment I knew my baby is all safe. Her team tried to get my baby delivered naturally but considering my situation, Dr. Neha suggested c sec without any delay to avoid any risk. Cant forget this when she told her family \"can't leave Priya in this situation\". I was falling short of words as the gratitude we have towards Dr. Neha can't be described in words and she is the first angel in our life who gifted us our lil princess.\nDr. Neha Khandelwal- We cant express how blessed we all feel to have you in our motherhood journey, would stay connected always. Thank you is such a small word to express what we feel but still would say Biggest Thank You from our family.",

She not only helped us plan the next pregnancy but also guided us in conceiving within 5 months. I cannot thank ma\u2019am enough for being so patient and positive, and for making us believe that this time around this pregnancy will end in good news. After conception, for the next 4 months I had severe vomitings, this was around the same time as the second wave of COVID. Even though physical examinations weren\u2019t possible, she was always available on whatsapp and practo video calls. Ma\u2019am not only understood where my anxiety was coming from but also never discouraged us from seeking frequent refuge in her advices. During our 5th month scan we got to know that my cervical length was shortening significantly, and without wasting even a single day, she guided us in taking proactive measure of getting a cerclage put in place the very next day. Ma\u2019am accommodated us for a surgery with no prior notice and I remember her saying to me in the OT- \u2018Together we\u2019ll cruise through this and make sure you get a healthy baby at the end of this road.\u2019 Her compassion is what sets her apart from all the other doctors. Post the cerclage we took the pregnancy two weeks at a time, making them our milestones. From 18th week, ma\u2019am got us safely to 37 weeks 3 days; which is when we finally decided to deliver owing to my 8-10 vomitings a day. Again, after inducing labour pains twice for almost 10.5 hours, she accommodated us for a C- Section when Normal wasn\u2019t working out. Ma\u2019am came through with her promise at the end and on 20th November at 10:58 am I gave birth to my rainbow baby- a boy. I cannot ever thank Dr. Neha Khandelwal ma\u2019am enough; for her compassion, kindness, expertise. What I can maybe strive to do, is honour her gift; my baby, and raise him to emulate all the qualities this miracle Doctor possesses. \n\nI know this is a long post, but every word I penned comes from heart, and moreover needs to be said to celebrate the selfless drive of our amazing doctor to send us home with a baby. \n\nThank you so much Neha Ma\u2019am. \nMy husband and I are Indebted to you for life. \n\nRegards.",

I met Mam when I was 32week pregnant as we recently shifted our base back to delhi but after meeting her we were confident that we wanted to go with her. I was admitted on 2nd nov at 8:30pm as advised by Mam as I was 2days from entering week 41. So she advised to induce labour. After that I thought it will be a easy process & deliver normally. My cervix dilated to 9cm after the procedure by 3:30am.It was just a matter of last stage & push to deliver normally but i was drained & couldn't push properly. Mam waited till 5:30 (almost 2hrs) to deliver normally. But at the last moment we had to take a decision as baby's heart rate was changing drastically & we wouldn't wanted to risk anything. So went with c-sec & I then remembered mam's words when I met her for the first time,That it doesn't matter if it's normal or c sec, priority is always baby's health. And no Dr would forcefully for go c sec unless required. I got discharged after 3 days.So it's all in the mind.Also we have many pre conceived notions about delivery,one of them is about normal or c sec. After the experience i can say that it depends upon one's situation.Any decision should be based on baby & mother's health. It's a cliche line but yes you forget every pain when you hold your baby for the first time. Could really feel this line.\nAlso I would like to give special mention to Mam's team who equally encouraged me to bear the contraction pains & helped me to give that last try. Thank you Mam for your support & advise. As every new mom in the group says you are in safe hands with Dr Neha & today I can say & really mean it as well\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude00Last few words for mom to be's - Please follow every lil thing instructed or advised by Mam as it really helps.All the best for your new birth\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

You always go above and beyond towards healthy outcome of your patients and I feel so blessed to have you as my doctor.\nDoctor Neha is one of the proactive doctors I have ever met in my life.\n\nSo my water broke at home and that to on diwali night when everyone else was preparing for diwali puja incl. me\ud83d\ude05 but my lil angel wanted to come on that night only. So after telling dr. about my water break she immediately called me and asked me to get admitted to the hospital right away as I was already 3 cm dilated in my last visit. She proactively shared my reports and summary in advance to her team so that there will be no delay. Her team induced pains and send each and every update to the doctor. Finally when the time came for the final push she made sure to be there with me for my delivery 1'o clock at night  just to ensure safe delivery. She work tirelessly in the hospital over that on the day of diwali when everyone wants to be at home, she  sacrificed her day and be with me. And on the top of that she got a patient like me with zero tolerance and patience, who did not cooperated with her while she was doing her task. Apologises for my behaviour during delivery.\n\nDoctor like Neha are very rare to find. And I think we all are very fortunate to have her during our pregnancies.\n\nAt last many many thanks to you doctor to believe in me that I can deliver normally and if I can deliver normally then every who is under Dr. Neha's guidance can deliver normally if you listen to her advice properly. She can do wonders during your labour that you can't even think that you did this! ",

There is so much to write about the journey till this date.\n\nMy friend 3 years ago had doctor Neha as her doctor for her delivery it was since then that I knew a good and trusted doctor. When we started our journey we went to rainbow for consultation, as soon as we were out my husband said \"she is our Dr.\" One thing he always says the best abt her is she is cut to cut, the realties very well spoken and she will tell you to the extent you need to know. Our journey through these nine months was quite smooth. Before 38 weeks as my water broke I was completely panicked, called Dr. she examined and said to be admitted. I had always wanted a normal delivery was not very sure and was completely panicked and unprepared for this admit situation. If it had been any other doctor I don't know if she could bear with me for so long. For more than 15 hours of admission I did not have pain and was unsure if even normal delivery was possible. The next 6 hours in all the pain I had given up, I asked doctor to please operate and rif me off the pain and she said to just wait for next 2 hours. Doctor I don't remember much since the time you had said this as I think I was either asleep or unconscious with pain. She told my husband that I will do it.  That was her faith and patience.\n\nAnd that way we brought a new life in the world and it was so natural birth. The entire team of rainbow from the nurses in the labour room to delivery to discharge and any other care they were there tirelessly to accompany you on your D day.\n\nI cannot thank them less for bearing with my shouts in the labour room and delivery room.\n\nEven post shifting to my room tirelessly the team would come and check if there was any requirement or any help. You can trust the entire team of rainbow. You are definitely in very safe hands and whatever is best as per your situation is what will be done for u.\n\nReading this currently may just be words but trust me, once it is your D day you would have a similar realisation.\n\nI just realised I have written a lot to read so will stop here. You all just be sure that you are in the best hands and entirely trust Dr  for her decision.\n\nAll the very best for ur days ahead!!!",

She inspires faith n confidence in a way I haven't seen any doctor/guide does. I had an enjoyable n smooth 9 months thanks the reassurances, instructions, preventive treatment, query resolution etc. \n\nI must also share my experience of labour, I won't lie, it was the hardest thing I ever had to do but the faith in each decision Dr. Neha's was making n everything she was saying helped me sail through n have a normal delivery. She cared enough about my quick healing to make so much effort to convince, motivate n push me to deliver normally even when I was giving up. N waited patiently for the baby and me to be ready..N it all came from pure love n care for me..at that time I was dizzy n in pain but now when I look back, I feel so overwhelmed..i see how she brought everyone around (her team and my husband who was unsure I could/should deliver normally) to make it happen!\n\nI must also mention two initiatives by her that she manages beyond call of duty:  a whatsaap community of all her pregnant patients n new mothers. And free thematic online sessions and QnAs on pregnancy related topics with experts every month. Both of these make the experience of pregnancy very different under Dr. Neha.. Because, you feel party of a community, there is quick resolution of small queries on whatsaap, there's access to information about excersises, new born baby care, preparing for labour, mental health, skin care etc and many more themes through the sessions! I don't know any other doc who organizes these. ",

As per all international guidelines - FOGSI , ACOG and RCOG , PMS does not warrant any investigations .\nMy practice was absolutely in accordance with that .\nNo doctor practices to declare patients healthy in case they have a disease . But if a doctor feels that the patient does not have a disease , she has a right to say so . Prescribing investigations that are not required is a practice supported not by medical ethics .\n More than money for any doctor , what matters is  the satisfaction of treating people as per correct guidelines .\nI had given you enough time and asked at the end if you have any more questions . the reader may note that over 200 patients and more than 99 percent have specified that my response time even to messages is very very less and that they were satisfied with the time given to them . So this is a false allegation . Also , the reader may note that my fees is clearly mentioned on the practo app and i have not charged anything extra at all . Before booking the appointment the patient must have noted the fees . Also the said patient had rebooked an appointment with me after over 15 days . if she was so unhappy , i dont understand the reason behind rebooking the appointment .",

I came to the doctor's appointment with much detailed explanation of how I was tired and how i was experiencing discomfort.\n\nWhat was a miss was that the doctor wasn't listening but rather dismissing every concern on the counter question of  whether what i was experiencing was 'pain' or 'discomfort'. this questiin was posed with no explanation of what might the difference in her educated opinion between the two be or whether discomfort did not include ppain.i also insisted that my energy levels were low and this shouldn't be for half a month but the comment frok the doctor that I received was that PMS is common for 15 days.  To me that was odd as she meant half a year could be PMS and it was normal to be energy less. \n\nSurprisingly, and rather confidently, the doctor told me to get a ultrasound done, upon my constant persistence, as to her all my symptoms (which were detailed) seemed normal and it was only  as i insisted i got the condescending ultrasound option, if I must for 'my own mental satisfaction'.\n\nThankfully I believed my body and I didn't listen ** *** *** ****** as I guess the doctor wasn't listening but just giving me her 10 minutes for a good hefty fees. ***** ** *********** ***** **** ****** ****** ********* **** ******* ** ******** *** **** ******** ****** *** ** ****** *** ** ** **** ** *** ****** ****** \n\nIts of no use if you pay such high consultation fees and the doctor cannot hear you out properly for 5 minutes without the condescending 'if you must for your own mental satisfaction'.  Isnt coming to a doctor a step towards that? \n\nI would therefore disagree with the experience and would say the consultation was rather a bad choice.",

I want to share my experience.\n\nWhen I came to know I was pregnant I started searching for a doctor who would have years of experience.  After visiting three doctors finally we had  chosen one of the most popular doctors and the journey started. \n\nI was keeping in  touch with that doctor till my 30th  week. \nBut a kind of dissatisfaction inside my mind was going on with that doctor due to some reasons. \nThen I finally made up my mind to change the doctor. \n\nThrough the reference of my friends I saw Dr. Neha on my 30th week. I had the following complication..\n\n1. baby underweight at 30th week,\n \n2. at the time of my internal examination I came to know that I had a small pelvis\n\n3. at the time of labour pain through induction baby passed meconium.\n\nDr Neha firstly improved my diet,  and for small pelvis she advised me to do pelvic Massage, Squats mopping and other exercises .\n Because of Dr Neha my delivery is so smooth. She supported me as a sister. I am very thankful to her for my lifetime.\n My advise to everyone\nChoosing a good doctor is more important in Pregnancy.  A doctor who gives you time, having patience to hear your problems, gives you  mental support, builds your confidence,  attends your calls , replies to your messages , clears your doubt, .. I found every thing I neededin this journey in Dr. Neha. Her zoom sessions are very useful and I was not getting from my previous Doctor.\n\n Dr. Neha guided me about exercises in my OPD visits.  One more thing I like she emphasises on natural foods instead of food supplements. \n\nI request all  to be patient, follow all the instructions given by Dr. Neha.\n\nI m really thankful to Dr. Neha for making this journey memorable for me and taking good care  during pregnancy as well as at the time of delivery. A Big thanks to you Neha mam.\n\u2764\ufe0f",

Thanks to her expertise, dedication, and unwavering commitment, I was blessed to give birth to a beautiful baby boy on September 19th.\n\nFrom the moment I first met her, I knew I was in the hands of a truly exceptional gynecological doctor. Her guidance and encouragement throughout my pregnancy were invaluable. She not only ensured the well-being of my baby but also cared for my overall health. Her insistence on regular exercise, weight management, and a healthy lifestyle played a pivotal role in making this pregnancy a success. She tried her best that i can have a Normal delivery though circumstances changed at the last moment.\n\nI also appreciate your accessibility and the way you were always just a call away whenever I had questions or concerns.\nOnce again, thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping me bring my precious son into this world. You are not just an exceptional doctor but also a wonderful human being. I will forever be grateful for your care and support.",

My entire pregnancy journey was very smooth and total credit goes to her. One thing in my life I always struggled was being consistent. But surprisingly I followed her to the 'T' right from preconception to the LDR room Delivery table. Never would I have thought that I have that strength that I can deliver normally. Here as well, more than me she believed in me that I can and supported, encouraged and motivated me throughout and here I am \ud83e\udd70.\nI will definitely vouch for Normal delivery as before discharge when your Superdoc says \"You can lead a normal life now\" will be like music to your ears and very surprising as well because one can do some daily chores as well. \nWith this lovely journey ending, it feels a little sad knowing that probably I would not be able to meet her in future \u2639\ufe0f\u2639\ufe0f.\n\nThank you \ud83d\ude18\nMrinalini",

Immensely overwhelmed by the treatment received at Cloudnine. All the nurses n staff are extremely welcoming even at odd times. We have learned that we should inform our doctor even if it is a small issue. So that she could take care of it and you are fit enough at the time of discharge. Due to a small communication mishap, after the delivery, I had some complexities. Madhu n Rupinder sisters were an angel to me. They encouraged n helped me to breastfeed my baby. I would always be thankful to them \ud83d\ude42. I would request all of you to inform your doctor about the small issues. So that she can ensure that you are fit for the fight \ud83d\ude00.Lastly, I would like to thank Neha Khanna mam as well for being so supportive throughout the whole journey n reminding me always of all the appointments \ud83d\ude42 Special thanks from Deepak's end as he could enjoy the precious moments of baby's arrival.Thanks And Immense Gratitude (Surya n Deepak)",

As a new mother, that\u2019s all you need and doc\u2019s been our rock through the whole journey! From being accessible at all times and to treating any doubt or query no matter how small with great care, she kept our anxieties at bay and I have to say I\u2019ve had the smoothest journey from Pregnancy to post op recovery all thanks to her. \nVery few people are as passionate, dedicated and well informed about what they do. From making sure I got my skin to skin contact to giving me the confidence to walk within 24 hours, I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better experience to bring my little one into the world, \nWe\u2019ll always be grateful to her for being our guide with her comforting smile through these 9 months. \nI highly recommend her to anyone looking for a modern yet rooted approach to pregnancy with sound reasoning and logic behind every guideline!

From the day we met her, she has been available 24x7 to guide us through all our doubts. I always had a list of questions ready for her and she always answered every single query (even the silly ones) with such warmth. We simply couldn't have asked for a better doctor and her presence made our entire journey of pregnancy and delivery very smooth.Also it was her presence which made us choose cloudnine for our baby.I again want to thank dr. Neha for going extra mile and understanding my personal situation also and was really really considerate,even cloudnine as well.My pregnancy journey was really smooth and we wanted a normal delivery and tried for one too but finally opted for c-section as it was my personal decision and she was so considerate for that also. Finally want to thank cloudnine for amazing and warm experience . God bless",

My both pregnancy journeys have been made beautiful and smooth by Dr. Neha Khandelwal. During my first pregnancy I initially consulted several Gynaecologists due to severe complications but my search ended when I first met her. She has been very re-assuring and handled all my complications during both pregnancies very deftly with her expertise and experience. \n\nIn my second pregnancy, my water bag bursted at 36 weeks, my earlier sutures got open and I reached hospital in emergency situation, unbelievably, thanks to her quick response and able leadership my baby was born within 2 hours of arrival at the hospital.\n\nI believe, Dr. Neha ** *** **** ************* ** ********* *** not only understands and addresses all your concerns during pregnancy, but also solves most trivial doubts with lots of patience.. is always available on call/WhatsApp for emergency and regular queries.\n\nShe has impeccable expertise in her domain and in-depth understanding of patient psychology. She encourages and emphasises on regular exercise, proper diet and rest and conducts various sessions online/offline for various issues faced during pregnancy like skin related issues, diet, exercise, breast feeding, labour management,etc.. all of which personally benefitted me a lot.\n\nI would like to thank her and her entire team of doctors for immense support and care during my pregnancy journey.",

After searching in \"Google\" and \"Practo\" for good gynecologist in south Delhi, we found the excellent reviews of Dr. Neha Khandelwal ma'am. Instantly we took decision to meet with Dr. ma'am for further consultation. After the first consultation, we became so relaxed that our tension totally finished. She simply told us that normal couple should try for one year to get positive result for conceive and she advised us not to worry anymore and suggested minimal medicine and normal workout. After one and half months only, I got positive result and conceived. From our initial visit till delivery, I can deeply express my gratitude to ma'am because I was confident that I am in the best hands and my every words is less to express my thanks to Dr. Neha ma'am. The excellence, dedication, perfection and the way she elaborates all the matter, I challenged that she is the Best. I was never been tensed as I knew that I was in the Best hands of Dr. Neha ma'am. My whole pregnency journey became so easy only because of Dr. ma'am. Always I knew that she is just one call away for any of my issues. Lastly I want to give my thanks to all staffs of cloudnine who also were very supportive during my visits and delivery. Once again my all thanks to Dr. Neha ma'am and her team.",

But after the initial couple of visits, after clearing my doubts I was confident that I was in safe hands. Dr. Neha motivated me to have normal delivery so she encouraged me to do yoga and walks. Everything was going fine until one day in my third trimester I was diagnosed with cholestasis of pregnancy (liver disease) \nI got so scared when I googled about the disease.\nDr. Neha assured me not to worry and  asked me to just relax and follow her instructions which I did. The disease was controlled well in time. \nFinally I was able to deliver normally with the constant support  of Dr Neha and her team.\nDr. Neha is an amazing doctor and a wonderful person. Thank you for your support during this wonderful journey  as well as your encouragement to help me get to the best times in my life. We are beyond thankful to you. Words can't say how much we appreciate you but thank you so much for everything\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\n\nDivya & Ravi",

Within seconds, I was sure like she is the one whom I needed from the start. She always used to be so thorough, I seldom had to ask anything else.

I would say with every visit to Dr Neha I felt more and more confident  since I knew I am in good hands. Dr Neha during my entire pregnancy was guiding me just like a mother would. During labour also I was confident due to her words and all the expertise that she shows in every situation. She was very supportive during my labour and ensured that my baby was delivered safely to me. I was only due to her expertise that i was able to deliver normally. She genuinely pays attention and cares for her patient like family. She has a very positive vibe which is what a women need during her pregnancy. I can't thank Dr Neha ma'am enough with just words. I would highly recommend Dr Neha to every expecting mother.",

With great joy, I want to share with you\u2019ll that we were blessed with a baby boy on the 25th of November under the guidance of Dr. Neha. \nAlso, a little (actually long \ud83e\udd2d) story to share - I met Dr. Neha during my second trimester, when I was pretty exhausted with a terrible first trimester. Although, the previous gynae had a lot of experience, I couldn\u2019t emotionally connect with her.\nSince this was my first pregnancy, I wanted someone who would not only help me, but also guide me to get this baby safely into this world! My first appointment with Dr. Neha, she spent 30 minutes in getting to know my history, explaining the future diet, exercise (which my previous doctor never did) and the change of medicines. I immediately felt so confident and positive about the upcoming appointments as she was so positive and only kept asking to focus on the positives. She was so thorough in each of her appointments and ensured that I felt safe and happy. I was so focused on a normal delivery but because my cervix did not dilate even after three inductions, had to opt for an abdominal birth. I guess sometimes our babies decide how they want to arrive in this world \ud83e\udd2d\ud83d\ude2c\nWith a lot of gratitude and respect, I want to thank you Dr. Neha for being so patient, caring and helping me get my baby safely to this world.\nRegards,\nMadhuri & Vineet",

I really wanted to share with you all about my pregnancy as this was my 2nd pregnancy earlier also delivered under mam. She has been my mentor the way she handled me in my previous as I was very adamant for c-section bcz of unbearable labour but she has all faith in me that I am capable to deliver normally & I did. In last few mintues she & her team took to labour & i delivery normally (have thrown lot of tantrum in OT \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c). This time I was well prepared for normal delivery too. All I can say is that if you have right person beside you throughout ur journey you will have a wonderful 9 month which I had in both of my pregnancies. She is always available for all your queries & personally recommending to all the moms that don\u2019t worry about you & your as you are in safe hands.",

I was diagnosed with FGR issues but under Doctor\u2019s guidance our daughter was born healthy and with 3kgs weight. I would have delivered normally but my pain intolerance led to last minute c-section. Dr. Neha was there on her toes for us at midnight. Her team is incomparable they make you feel so much like a family. I had cried and hugged the nurses in labour while going through the pains. I can\u2019t thank you enough. I know I am never going to change my Gynae for the whole of my life. Trust Dr. Neha blindly guys. She will fight for her patients and take stand for them like anything. Special thanks to your coordinator as well. She is completely a sweetheart and a person to rely on.",

Honestly speaking we were very scared initially but after meeting Dr Neha she made us feel confident and we took her advice and it was smooth sailing after that.I gave birth at 39 weeks and 5 days.We had always planned for a normal delivery but due to palpitations in the final few weeks it was a risk to me and the baby.We decided to have a C section delivery and this decision was made much more easier after talking to Dr  Neha.\nWords can never be enough for you Dr Neha but still a big Thank you\ud83d\ude4f \ud83d\ude4floads of love from all three of us\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0fJust an advice for all the wonderful ladies out there,please follow her advice no matter what and trust her .She is the best out there.",

But to our surprise she was though physically not there but she was there throughout, connected with her team. I was astonished to see her response even  2 am early in the morning. \nFor maam we are not only her patients, she is a kind hearted person who understands the emotions of a mother. That's why no matter how  menial or serious concerns we asked ma'am in the group,  she always responds. We couldn't get any better .\nThank you ma'am and may God always shower blessings on you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The kindness, support, motivation and team you get from her and her team not only boost you but gives you energy to bear and to meet your angel healthy.\n\nMy piece of advice before i conclude : You are in safe hands and you will be the next one to describe the story of your journey if you follow what she says.\n\nThank you Dr Khandelwal for helping us to meet our angel.\n\nYou are and will always be a great souvenir in our lives.\n\nLot of love and respect\nSneha and Amit",

And the credit for the same goes entirely, and completely, to Doctor Neha \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nI first met her about 2 years back and since then I haven\u2019t visited any other doctor ever, for pretty obvious reasons.\n\nRight since the very inception, Doctor Neha advised me to eat well, exercise well and not take unnecessary stress. In fact, when I first met her for my pregnancy checkup she told me that it\u2019s going to be cakewalk. That confidence and support helped me immensely in dealing with all pregnancy related issues.\n\nI had a satisfying birth experience, all thanks to Doctor Neha, and my only contribution in that was to try and sincerely pay heed to whatever she advised. So please trust me when I tell you that all that you have to do is to follow her advise, without question or doubt.\n\nNot just that but I can\u2019t emphasise enough upon just how much I appreciate the fact that despite being extremely busy, she is always accessible when ever you need to get in touch with her. And to top it all her calm, and when required stern demeanour, helped me a lot in keeping calm, and focus on what was important.\n\nTo sum it up, I and my husband can only extend endless thank you(s) to Doctor Neha. I sincerely wish to have a life long association with her. Also my husband sincerely reflects the same thoughts.",

Her approach was very different and very straightforward- to do what is best for the baby and the mother and guide the parents on all 0-10 possibilities. Her positive attitude and concern regarding well-being of the child and mother was what clicked and I knew we were in safe hands.\nShe guided us every step of the way, starting from food, exercises, baby\u2019s physical and mental well-being, milestones and various indicators to look out for. \nShe helped me in delivering our little angel naturally and guided me throughout the labour and post partum as well. \nShe made our entire journey very comfortable. If you are looking for a gynaecologist obstetrician whom you can trust blindly, she is the one! \nI\u2019ll be forever grateful to her for helping me deliver my bundle of joy and ensuring I recover in minimum time! \nKudos to you, Dr. Neha!

Dr. Garima , sister Sandhya , Rosalin and Sheila made me motivated to stick to my normal delivery decision at the time of extreme painful contractions where I was in delimma  I could not make it to normal . They are really very sweet and helpful.\n\n I met Dr. Neha Khandelwal after a miscarriage experience and she has assured me that I could be a mum .  That happened and I am a happy proud mum today. I will urge and advice everyone to just listen to the instructions what Dr. Neha says , she has some magic believe me when I say some magic she really has\ud83d\ude07 her instructions  gives so much of strength to deliver the baby in a natural way. I have troubled her too for a while for which I feel really sorry , on those sort of moments just keep in mind - listen to her and action what she says you are in the safest hand . Me and my husband are so thankful to you Dr. Neha without your advice and guidance this pregnancy could have not been so smooth . When I suffered covid in my 1st trimester I got so terrified but it was you who gave me all hope and trust and finally we could become a proud parent of our lovely daughter . Thankyou Dr. Neha\n",

After examination, I was transferred to OT without delaying any further n Dr. Neha reached within 10-15 min to hospital. I was admitted in Emergency at around 8:30 PM n by 10 PM I got my kids out. I was very anxious and tensed about everything but Dr. Neha and her team was so helpful all throughout my delivery from explaining things to filling forms to giving anaesthesia and at the end handing over my reward for so long I hv been waiting, I can guarantee that Dr. Neha had been my best Choice abt Doctor to deliver my babies n She is so amazing that you actually don\u2019t feel worried at all under her guidance.

In the last month of my pregnancy I had some BP issues n that's the moment Neha mam doesn't want to take a risk so she instantly took a decision to deliver me before my due so got admitted on 5th night n got delivered by 6th with the support of Neha mam n her team although my case was got complicated at the end as I am unable to push the baby so mam decided to do forceps and that time I saw mam's concern at that moment but after so much effort by mam and her team got my bundle of joy and I really broke in to tears. It's my first and wonderful experience with Dr. Neha and I really appreciate the effort and her work towards her each and every patient. Please guys do believe in Dr. Neha that she's will do whatever right for you n your baby and follow her advice without any second thought and at the end I am really grateful to you Dr. Neha for such an  extremely beautiful unforgettable experience.",

I delivered my 2nd baby on 27th this month,via C-sec due to chronic hypertension and C-sec in past as well. I would say that you are in best hand may be this is something you will believe when you will experience at your own. As soon as, you will hit the floor you will be treated with utmost care 'people on the floor will know you by doctor Neha's patients' they will provide you care with the guidelines laid down by Dr Neha without fail, this is all because of goodwill/ strict instructions of Dr Neha to her staff(though they themselves are very good at their work) as she cares for her patients and their babies too much and can go above and beyond and work tirelessly towards a healthy outcome. Just last but not the least\n You are an amazing doctor and a wonderful person. Thank you for your support during some really tough times and moulding my decision and helping me to make my family complete(hope you remember the initial story). I'm beyond thankful for my baby boy. Words can't say how much I appreciate you but thank you so much for everything!",

Dr. Neha has been rock solid support for us right from the start. \n\nAt the start we had searched  to find a doctor just to confirm if we were pregnant. After visiting her the 1st time, we were so comfortable that we didn\u2019t look for anyone else and have been consulting her for everything right from day 1.\n\nEverything was going great and we were all set for normal delivery but we got to know about a complication in form cerebral redistribution in the 36th week due to which Dr. Neha suggested for early delivery in 37th week. This condition also meant that chances for normal delivery was less.\n\nFinally yesterday we first tried inducing for labor pains twice for normal delivery but nothing happened. When it didn\u2019t occur we went ahead with c-section. Eventually during the operation, we realised that the cord had tied the baby\u2019s neck twice. Had the labor pain induced and we would have proceeded for normal delivery, it would certainly have become more complicated.\n\nI will just say have complete faith. Everything will turn out well. To be honest we were initially slightly worried about cerebral redistribution, early delivery and c-sec as all was great till 36th week. We did feel why all this now. But when we look back now, all was meant to have a safe and sound delivery. All is great now.\n\nWe wish all the to-be mothers great time ahead and all the very best.",

She has been counselling us not only as a doctor but as a good friend for the last 6 months and it has been amazing. \nShe has been the pillar of support that we were looking for. She has always been available to answer our silliest queries. The best part is that she has always been motivating me for a normal delivery, since the very beginning.\n\nAnd yesterday, she become my superhero, when inspite of all odds stacked against me, she was able to get a normal delivery [No Epidural]. She is a seasoned professional but very caring at the same time. No doctor will stay with you for 4 hours in your labour, but she was there with me since the moment I was admitted for delivery. Thank you so much maam. \nOne thing I know for sure, had it not been for Dr Neha, I would have never achieved a normal delivery. I am deeply indebted to Dr Neha for life. Without any iota of doubt, she is the best doctor ever. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc95",

She brings a lot of positive energy with her and kept us motivated. While we were new to Delhi(less than 1 month) and did not know much about the  best doctors to visit, we luckily visited Dr. Neha @ Rainbow hospital. Our priority was NVD and were also worried as I have RH(-ve) blood group.  I had my first delivery through LSCS and only had less than 50 percent chance for a normal delivery (as said by my friends and relatives).  To our surprise, doctor preferred NVD than C-Section during our first visit itself and it is because of her efforts, routine checkup and experience, today we are proud parents of a healthy baby through normal delivery. She is very humble, caring, friendly and approachable.  Felt more like a family doctor, while interacting with her, during the whole course of treatment. She listened patiently to our queries and her gestures always made us comfortable, whenever I or my husband had any stress. Couldn't have had a better experience than this. I would recommend everyone, especially who are either confused or in split mind, to visit her once, and you will certainly feel motivated",

I began consulting her during the ninth month after switching from my previous doctor, and I was initially worried about adjusting to the change at the last moment. However, during our first meeting, I felt relaxed and happy to have made the switch. Throughout the final month, Dr. Neha went above and beyond, giving her utmost effort, and I am grateful for the successful delivery under her care. What I admire most is her kind and helpful nature\u2014always ready to address concerns at any time. ",

Even though we tried for a normal delivery for almost 16hours, due to certain complications we had to go in for an emergency C-Section. Not even once did we doubt anything as we felt very secure around Dr Neha, we knew that we are in safe hands. We would like to thank Dr Neha from the bottom of our hearts for giving us our baby girl.",

From the day 1 she has been instrumental and clear with her ask that she wants us to not overthink, eat healthy, exercise daily, do not believe on outside knowledge (Specially googling) instead ask her directly. In addition to that she guided us to belive that each women can tend to have different signs and symptoms in this journey. Because we all women are grown with the mindset that this happened with my mother, sister, friends, etc that can also happen with us & I have my own best example/experience to share which nobody told me until I conceived and experienced myself that urine passing can have sleepless nights so this was a learning out of my experience. \n\nLastly, we never had the history of any delivery from Dr Neha in our family and the day I conceived my husband and I started looking for a doctor and our gut feeling ended with Dr Neha & we feel very fortunate today. She has become like a family and anyday she can be ur doctor, teacher, sister and mother. As whenever we don\u2019t follow she will scold you like a big sister, teacher and I had that many moments with her\u2026 Till today I have not seen any doctor emphasising on normal delivery rather than c section.\nThanks once again. We love you \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAnd all the ladies work, eat, exercise, sleep and repeattttt \ud83d\ude1c",

From that initial day to this date, we share a bond, which is hard to build in such a changing world. It seems that Dr Neha doesn\u2019t belong to this world, she is a fairy, who has so much dedication to her work and that\u2019s too without any expectations. She never missed my any communications in distress, when being an expected mother who feels anxiety or some medical conditions, she always responded in prompt basis and act as your best buddy to resolve your crisis and leave you with a positive touch of life. I am blessed to get such an excellent doctor, who always makes you feel a delightful experience, which is a boon in the life of expected mothers. I can write for hours and still feels that it is more to come for such a nice, humble human being, however I am ending this note with a thank you and blessing from the core of my heart for her well being and prosperity.\nAlong with our angel doctor, Dr Neha, her entire team is super charged and always keen to help the people like me and make me feel at home. \n\nAt the end, I am thankful to whole staff and our doctor Dr. Neha for such a delightful experience and a sweet memory for a lifetime.\nHighly obliged \u2026\nNeena Rani Yadav",

She motivated me and my wife for normal delivery throughout, She was there with us at the time of delivery and explained all the things happening. She was present in the hospital through out the dilevery. Our baby came in this world at 11:11pm and she specifically waited till the last without any hurry and treated us as the best way we can expect.\n she has all our respect for restoring faith in doctors. Now lets come to financials She will try to save your money as much as you try. Let me give you one example. She was not clear with our last ultrasound reports so for more clarification she asked fetal doctor to perform one more ultrasound. She specifically asked billing team to bill us minimum as they can. And was there with fetal doctor for around 45 mins to see the live ultrasound status.\n And there are n number of incidents like this And before consulting her we went to a doctor who was charging money for almost every thing in fact she tried to go for a specific labs for test near her place. She(Dr Neha Khandewal Pandit) is always on our side!

I cannot praise Dr Neha enough for her support throughout my pregnancy and afterwards. Her personal touch and care made each and every day of my pregnancy a joyful experience. She is like a guardian angel, even the thought of her makes you forget all your worries and pains. I panic a lot during labour pain and I asked her to do a c- section ...but she showed lots of faith in my strength and keep motivated for   NVD. By the grace of almighty God and  very supportive Dr. Neha I delivered a daughter normally . \n\nSome lines for dr. Neha \"While life may be hard, you've helped me through so many things. You're a wonderful doctor that has gone above and beyond all of my expectations. Thank you  for doing everything you do, caring so much for your patients and being the best doctor that I have ever had. I am so grateful for the special things you do\" \n\nRadiology Department: I would like to specifically mention the department and the care with which Dr. Chanchal treated us. Her soothing and calm personality made every session of ours delightful. \n\nLactation team: A huge applause for this team for their consistent support. Dr. Mahima and Dr. Juhi made our journey extremely easy while setting the right direction for us. They have been the right guide for me. One more thing ..\nDr. Neha and dr. Juhi's simultaneous effort made my NVD possible . Her videos are very helpful .\n\nLast but not the least, a big shout out for the entire nursing team (Anjali, kiran). I would also like to mention Dr. Anamika who ensure me that my baby is healthy and good .",

I was then finally referred by my general physician to visit a Gayenic at Madhukar Rainbow Children's Hospital at the earliest.  At Rainbow, I fixed my appointment with the fist available Gayenicholigist Dr. Neha Khandelwal and when she examined me and checked my reports and conducted few more test it was found that I have infection in the urine and more alarmingly I had huge number of multiple Utrine Fibroids  measuring 10cm and above.  This needed immediate surgery to prevent further deterioration. So, to undergo surgery, at first place the urine infection had to be removed so I was given a week medication and the infection was removed.   After that Dr. Neha explained me the process to be followed for TLH (Total Laparoscopy Histrectomy).  She explained me with lot of ease and conviction that it's a latest technique  which cause less pain and less blood loss and one gets well and get discharged in 48hrs.  There is no side effects and recovery is faster.  I was fully convinced and her words were highly positive and I did not feel any mental pressure neither during or post surgery.  She has been a very caring, friendly and hold expertise in her field **  *******   Me and my family is highly satisfied.  The surgery went perfectly as it was explained to me.  I got discharged also after 48hrs with minimal bearable pain.  I was even able to do brisk walk in my room in the hospital just after the next day of the surgery.  KUDOS to new latest medical development and ABLE doctors like Dr. Neha Khandelwal who has performed the surgery  intricately and with complete perfection.  I owe humble gratitude to Dr. Neha. Wishing you all the very best. She is one of the best Gyanee I would definitely like to recommend others at the time of need. Thank you.",

So Dr Neha gave some medication and asked me to try naturally. Since that didn't work the next step was IUI. I was able to concieve on our first attempt with IUI which was done by Dr. Neha herself. My husband was also very happy. Then it was all regular checkups and ultrasound to keep a watch on the baby's growth. At the last three months my sugar levels started going up so Dr. Neha put me on a good diet. I was in the last two weeks of pregnancy and some  tests were done when we found out that the umbilical cord is around the baby's neck and also the blood sugar problem was there. I got a call in the evening that we can't keep the baby any longer and will go for c- section the next day. I got admitted in Rainbow the next day at 7 am and from there everything went smoothly. I delivered a healthy baby boy 4.19Kg. The  decision taken by Dr Neha was very right because if postponed the sugar levels could have harmed the baby. We are very happy with Dr Neha's prompt decision and professionalism that we are blessed to have a healthy baby boy. Now it's been 10 days since delivery and the baby and myself are doing just fine. Thanks\nVihuli Sumi Bansal and Neeraj Bansal",

During my 2nd month, I was so troubled by the mood swings that I even broke down in her cabin during consultation and she took an extra 15 minutes to comfort and guide me on how to get myself together. \n\nI was really looking forward to having her beside me during my delivery but have to move home for my last trimester. I'll still remember her as my first and favourite gynaec. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nFor everyone who's looking for a friendly and trusted gynaec, look no further! You've found the expert cum guide cum friend in Dr. Neha Khandelwal. Highly recommended!!",

It was my second pregnancy which was smooth and a healthy pregnancy for which i want to thank Dr. Neha  for always being available and suggesting everything that was best for me and my baby.  I met Dr. Neha during my first pregnancy in the late second trimester with a bit of complications which she handled so well that when i came to know about my second pregnancy I didn\u2019t even think about visiting any other dr. My heart just knew that if i will visit Dr. Neha than i really don\u2019t have to worry about anything and frankly telling my pregnancy went smooth. Dr. Neha was not just my dr during my pregnancy but she was also among my support system along with my husband and my parents. After every visit with Dr. Neha i went home with mental peace and a smile on my face.  Whatever i say for her would always be less. You are the best dr and also the best human that I\u2019ve met. Thank you so much mam for every motivation that you gave to me.",

I just trusted myself in her hands and that trust pulled me through moments of fear and weakness. Our stay at cloud 9 was super comfortable with nurses ready to help day and night. Ma'am's namesake and coordinator checked in with me each day and reminded me of upcoming scans and appointments whenever i forgot to follow up. Hospital staff was courteous and even allowed me a few tantrums as i recovered for three days at the hospital. We are grateful to Ma'am and i believe i have found someone to go to for medical advice for a lifetime. Only thing i kept repeating to myself inside the OT was that she will take care of me and my baby. Even the anesthesia team was very supportive and calming, especially Dr Ankur and Dr Anand. ",

Per her advice I followed proper medication, nutritious diet and exercise. \n\nAlong with her we would like to thank entire team at Cloudnine for their efficient and timely support and having smooth processes in place. Specially the efficient Nursing staff who did a commendable job handling the newborn.

But Dr. Neha patiently dealt with the situation, successfully did the cervical stitch and encouraged me to be optimistic. I was in bed rest for the rest of my pregnancy. Despite such complications, I was able to complete 36 weeks of pregnancy which, we were feeling earlier, was difficult to reach . But with Dr. Neha's guidance, motivation and continous support I was able to reach 9th month and also was able to deliver normally. \n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Neha's coordinator for always being highly responsive at all times.",

But when we met her we never had doubts. She cleared everything before even asking.\n\nUnder her guidance we made it to the onset of 37th week. She was always positive to take us to more than 36 weeks and the journey has been great and always motivational. We feel we couldnt have made it if it werent under her support and her always correct suggestions.\n\nThank you Dr. Neha and her team for helping me deliver the most precious gems of our lives.",

Yesterday I lost all hope for normal delivery however you kept me motivated and at the last everything went very normal, me and baby (my lil angel) both are in good condition. I really want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the way you have guided me in the last 9 months. I know that these words cannot define the entire thing but you're a rockstar ma'am. Please accept our (from my family side) thank you so much . \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70",

During my pregnancy I was diagnosed with jaundice & I was not sure weather I should continue with this pregnancy or not but I am so thankful to Dr. Neha as she handled it with great professionalism and compassion.She also encouraged me to exercise regularly and be positive and maybe that's why normal delivery was possible in the end.I would just say that you needn't worry as long as Dr.Neha is around & you are in safe hands just follow her instructions. No words of thanks would ever express my gratitude for u ma'am...thank you so much. Pooja & Rohit.",

Still she gave her 100% and tried induction. But her doubts turned correct and we had to go for c section, which also went very smooth with the help of her entire team. We will be forever grateful to her for helping us in bringing our little one into this world. No words for her motherly care.She is a constant support and the right motivation needed in this most crucial and important phase of life.",

I still remember the day I met her for the first time for my abortion in 2020. And the concern she showed that day made me make a promise to myself that she\u2019s going to be my doctor for my future pregnancy. And yes that day came quite soon and the journey with her being my mentor/ my gynecologist/ my teacher started. We really appreciate all the efforts and care she bestowed on us throughout the pregnancy. \nWe just want to thank her with all our hearts. And for respecting my choice for mode of delivery. And delivering such a cute and healthy baby. \nWe can\u2019t express how grateful we are. \nThank you again Doctor! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nWith heaps of love and respect for you, \nGaurav & Mandeep",

I became her fan when I learned that she allows husband in the delivery and labour room (unlike most doctors in India).\n\nShe always pushed me to eat healthy and exercise regularly for normal delivery. I delivered my baby full term at 39 weeks and 4 days. Labour was around 11 hours, and yes, it was super intense. I literally gave up multiple times and was asking for C-Sec. \n\nDr Neha was right beside me, and her motivating words felt so impactful at that time. The simple deep inhaling and exhaling that she always asked me to practice was magic. It led me through the whole labour.  Kudos to doctor Neha and her team for making my delivery experience so positive and helping me sail through normal delivery.",

My biggest thanks to Dr Neha for being our constant mentor and guide in our journey.\n\nI was referred to her by one of my friends to get counselled for conceiving issues and we got success within next month after we met her. Also, I was diagnosed with FGR in my first level scan and then IHCP in beginning of 3rd trimester and many more ups and downs during my pregnancy. She has always encouraged us to make appropriate dietary changes, medication and to exercise instead of googling the solutions and results. \n\nLast but not the least my last scan detected 2 loops around baby's neck due to which we had to be prepared for c-sec as well. Still I managed to deliver normally and without epidural with her support and least possible labour time. \n\nI would always recommend her in my knowledge to get the proper support to getting god's blessing.

I was diagnosed with GDD but with Dr.Neha's guidance and regular monitoring, it was brought under control by the time of delivery. Dr. Neha encouraged me to stay positive throughout the journey. She asked me for a sugar charting everytime I visited her & that really helped us to take the necessary course correction. I really loved how she kept a close watch on this aspect. As our friends recommended us to consult with Dr. Neha, I too would highly recommend her to my friends, family! Thank you Dr. Neha for your guidance & care. ",

I am very happy to share that I gave birth to a health baby girl on 21st sep under the amazing guidance of Dr. Neha through vaginal delivery. Right from the time I conceived my baby, I knew Dr. Neha is the only gynae I wanted to show since she is one of the most positive, refreshing and encouraging doctor I have ever met. Throughout the pregnancy, she guided me on everything and always ensured to keep encouraging.\nI went into natural labour at 38 weeks through water breaking and delivered in 2 hours. Throughout the labour Dr. Neha and her team kept me motivated because of which I could go through the entire process.\nThankyou Dr. Neha and her team for a wonderful experience. Me and my husband are forever thankful \ud83d\udc95",

I am very happy to share that I delivered my son normally on the 15th of Sep under the swift and well thought out approach of Dr Neha. She did not give up and also dint let me give up in the labour room. In the most vulnerable moments like these in life , having a Doctor like Dr Neha is a blessing and i also must appreciate her team for their empathetic words and touch in the labour room.\nDr. Neha once again thank you for everything \ud83d\udc9c\ud83e\uddff\ud83e\udd79",

She was always there to guide us, mentor us and support us throughout this whole pregnancy. I went through emergency cesarean but I had complete faith in Dr Neha as her only motive was to deliver a healthy baby. Just one advice to everyone there, trust her process and follow whatever she asks you to do completely because in the end all the pain you\u2019ll go through will be worth it. Neha ma\u2019am thank you so much for everything. ",

When I first conceived, my husband started with his search of best gynaecologist and there we met Dr. Neha. Indeed she is one of the finest gynaecologist.During the first trimester, I was diagnosed with a placenta complication where the blood flow to the baby was not adequate. I was very nervous about my pregnancy, but Dr. Neha always motivated me and encouraged me. Her clinical judgements have always proven to be right. I would say you all are in safe hands and you can completely rely on her. I would like to recommend her to others and have already started to recommend Dr. Neha to my friends. Thank you Dr. Neha for giving us the greatest blessing of life.                                     Lots of love and regards - Bhavna & Nitin",

I do not reside in Delhi as I am a government officer posted in Bihar but I was clear in my mind without any doubt that I will come to Delhi for her guidance time to time and finally for delivery because in 2018 I have done a normal delivery of a cute and handsome boy under her guidance only. Just by following her instructions and doing exercises I could be able to deliver both my babies normally and as per my experience I can advice all mommies to be that don't be afraid of normal delivery. It's not that hard. Just be calm and keep following Mam's guidance. Dr. Neha, I am a big fan of yours. Thank you for being so kind and next to my family member. You are a great personality.\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude4f",

She not only helped us deliver a healthy baby boy but most importantly she was always there at any hour of the day to answer to the worrisome questions of my wife and mine and always provided us solutions that worked wonders. Her USP is the clamness with which she deals with issues and she puts you in such a comfortable position taking all the tension on her own shoulders. She is exeptionally empathetic towards her patients and does not in anyway make them lose hope. Apart from being an exceptional doctor, she is an amazing human too. Thanks for giving us our baby 'Varenya'!",

We met her in 6th week and she had been a  constant support since then. She is the best combination of professionalism and friendliness. \nI would say Normal delivery is no cake walk but she and her team try their best to make it short and possible for you with walks and exercises. \nThank you so much Neha Mam and your team for all the efforts and giving me the best gift of my life right before your birthday\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

Thank you so much from the bottom of hearts for taking such good care of us during the pregnancy as well as the delivery!! Because of your professionalism and great smiles, we felt like we are in good hands and that gave us peace of mind towards the big day. Only because of your  guidance  and motivation  i could do normal delivery. Exercises, diet  plan suggested by Neha mam helped me alot and i could deliver  my baby normally. I was very worried  as mine was IVF case and  delivery  was 20 days befor the due date but because  of  Neha mam everything  went smoothly  and  we both are fine and came home. Thank you for helping deliver the most precious gift of our life!!\u201d at last I would  suggest everyone  to follow  Neha mam's advice  and do Exercises and drink 3 litter water daily for normal  delivery.",

You may experience other doc saying you 'beta' but that beta is MIL wala beta\ud83d\ude1d. Her encouragement gave me confidence to drive myself in labor pain from GNOIDA to hospital. I could not find any doc like her in NCR, who has caring mindset and not avaricious.\nThank you  Dr Neha for helping me complete my family. ",

We met Dr Neha once we conceived and from our first meeting with her we were reassured that we are safe. Doctor advised us to maintain a healthy diet, adequate exercise and keep a stress-free mind, all of which helped us to reach full term with our baby. Another thing which benefitted us greatly was Doctor\u2019s virtual briefing sessions with all her patients. They provide so much knowledge and invaluable tips and would suggest everyone to attend and note takeaways from them. We have been blessed with a baby boy on 1st March and we could not be any more thankful to God and Doctor Neha for this bundle of joy. And all the cliches are indeed true, the first glimpse of the baby makes hearts smile and journey memorable!",

We met her during the third month of our pregancy and never looked back. She is very supportive and listens to everythig you have to say. She made sure to provide all the necessary details and was super supportive during our journey.

But it was Neha mam who was always confident and gave assurance that it is definitely possible and we all together made it. Needless to say the contribution of all the nursing staffs in rainbow hospital which gave me the strength to hold longer. My husband's tremendous support and my belief in myself had helped me go through the contraction pain. My sincere request to all to have faith on Neha mam. Me and my husband would be forever grateful to the doctor (Neha Mam) and rainbow team. Have faith on Neha Mam.  Thank you so much Mam \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

You just need to completely follow her instructions and everything will be all right. She has always encouraged for normal delivery but I am sorry Ma'am disappointed you by opting for c section. \n\nThank you Neha Ma'am for all the advise and directions.

She held regular online sessions throughout the preganacy for us to be well prepared for what was heading our way. Always just a message or call away incase of the smallest query we had.

She's extremely positive by nature, clear & scientific in her guidance, unwavering in her support and inspires faith in the expecting mother to give their best. Most of all, she's an absolute professional and a Doctor I trusted completely to make all the right decisions for me and my baby. It was her timely and accurate decision making that ensured my baby was safely delivered and I too had the best postpartum recovery. I cannot thank her enough and be grateful for having her on this journey with me. I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone looking for a trustworthy and professional doctor for their pregnancy.",

Ma'am your true care for your patients can not be matched with any other doctor. Have not seen any doctor doing things so perfectly be it organizing regular sessions, managing whatsapp groups, addressing concerns online/offline and the list goes on.. We feel lucky and fortunate to  have you in this wonderful journey of motherhood .. You are not just a wonderful person but a woman who is mentally and physically strong.. We are thankful to Dr. Neha and the entire team for gifting such a wonderful present.. Thank You so much Neha Ma'am, words are less to express our gratitude.. Wishing each one of you best wishes and good luck. \ud83d\udc96\ud83e\udd17\u2764\ufe0f - Radhika & Siddharth",

At times I started to loose energy and faith in myself but you never gave up on me.\nAlong with Neha Mam, the entire team of doctors , sisters and support staff of Rainbow Hospital was very  kind, supportive and helpful who made me feel like I was at home. Dr. Neha was always available 24*7 and we visited Mam both at the Rainbow Hospital and FEHEALTH GK-1 for regular check ups.\nThankyou Neha Mam once again for being the hope and making everything so easy and smooth in the end.",

I must say that if I can deliver naturally then every girl can deliver naturally but please listen only Ma'am words and follow the same. I have no words for Ma'am who support me throughout my pregnancy journey. I know thank you is very less word but still Thank you so so much Ma'am\ud83d\ude0a ",

A doctor who is very rare to find and is truly a gem.\nI love you and admire you for your dedication and care towards your patients, and sorry if i disappointed you in any way. Thanks for tolerating me during labor. Would love to stay in touch with you forever.\nThank you is less but still THANKS a ton for understanding me.",

I delivered in Rosewalk hospital, they don\u2019t pay me to say this, but I\u2019ve been humbled by the quality of the service, and the holistic approach. It is the professionalism of doctor Neha Khandelwal and the magic ingredient which is Love that she puts in her work, and her sense of service that convence my husband and I to stay in India for our baby\u2019s birth. May God bless you doctor, and your posterity, and to all the moms to be, you are in really good hands. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\udf1f",

We shifted to Gurgaon from Mumbai after my first trimester and once we met Dr. Neha, we never once felt the need to see any other doctor, no matter how well recommended they were. She has guided us throughout the journey and has been an immense pillar of support and strength. She made sure that my husband was involved in the whole process and e used to look forward to seeing her for our regular checkups. The  sessions she organised were very helpful and we learned a lot from them. Extremely thankful to her for all she has done in these testing times . I wish good luck to everyone and know you all are in good hands.",

Being a true professional and great human being she came rushing in middle of the night to deliver our heartbeat with utmost ease... :) \n\nI would advise all the expectant mothers to follow her advises and do not hesitate at all to ask any question, because I have never seen a doctor with such a friendly and personal touch with its patients. \n\nWish a happy motherhood to all the lovely ladies out there!!\n\nThanks\nSmruti",

After searching we came to know about Dr. Neha and we are so glad that we came here. Dr. Neha is been always there for me and she always told me what is right for me and the baby as some times in pregnancy I used to get mood swings but she never let me be off track at any cost. I think if for any concerns related to me will ever come, my first and last preference would only be Dr. Neha Khandelwal. Thank you Doctor for all the concern and love from you for my entire pregnancy experience. The whole team worked like magic for me.",

I was admitted in Rainbow hospital on 28th Sep morning with water leak, inspite of few medicine issues with my previous Doctor she did everything to go for Normal delivery with spending good 4-5 hrs with me only. She's like an angel to me for bringing new phase (my monkey) in my life with all her commitment and positivity, Happy to find you as a Doctor, friend, advisor........",

I got little anxious, however doctor mention the fact that she will first tey for normal vaginal delivery and if things doesnt works, then CSec. On precious Wednesday, I was being induced as planned and delivered baby girl through CSec as it didnt turn out to be case of normal one.

A working couple staying away from family,  we had no prior experience in the matter.  She became more of a guardian to us.  Always approachable,  precise answers to queries,  ever patient to listen to any and every question that one might throw at her.  A doctor with a commitment.  All the best madam. Hope you continue to scale new heights in your profession and life. \n\nCheers!  \nSayan Mukherjee ",

She started my treatment from second trimester and from that period to my successful normal delivery, she has been very kind, helpful and good listener with exact solution to my problems. Always available on phone for patients. In the 36th week I was detected pregnancy jaundice and because of that she decided to make my delivery on the 38th week instead of waiting for due date or labour pain so that it can't effect the health. She made my normal delivery by inducing labour pain succesfully. Now I have my sweet baby boy who is safe and doing very well. Many thanks to Doctor for such a decision. I will recommend her always by default because she is a star.",

Still, I can\u2019t believe that I had a normal delivery.\nI find Neha Ma'am's cool, collected approach to be one of her best qualities. She never rushes to a conclusion without listening to her patients.\nAt last, I just wanted to thank her on behalf of the entire family. This world is blessed to have a doctor like you!!\u00a0\n\nBest of luck to all the mommies to be out there!!\n\nThanks and Regards\nEkaksh, Priya, and Amit",

We would like to thank Neha Khanna mam for her immense support and warm gesture. \n\n We would like to thank the entire Cloudnine team for making this journey further beautiful and smooth. To begin with, the one woman who clears all your (non medical related) doubts be it anything or everything is Miss Moumita, she is just tooooo good. The pediatricians and lactation consultants are very helpful, the nursing staff at the hospital is supremely supportive, special thanks to Anita jee, Madhu jee and Premlata jee.

My journey started with Dr. Neha right from the first month of pregnancy. She guided us every step of the way and our journey couldn\u2019t have been better than this. Her prompt decision making; practical and honest approach to each and every situation, and pushing for what is best for each and every patient is what I admire the most. She tried her best to deliver me normally but due to some complications at the end, emergency C-sec was done to deliver our baby safely. Thank u so much Dr. Neha for giving me the greatest gift of my life and that too a day before our marriage anniversary. So it was a double celebration for us. If i can give any advise to rest of the mommies would be please follow her advise and instructions for a smooth and safe delivery.   I would like to additionally thank Dr. Neha for even treating and recommending the best treatment for my Mother-in-law sometime back in August this year. We are truly indebted to you Dr. Neha for making us a happy and healthy family. Glad to have found you as my doctor\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

Firstly It was normal delivery, since it was my first pregnancy so, she helped me a lot to understand everything throughout the journey. We have approached her as soon as i know that we are pregnant. She always motivated us by telling that we are doing good which helped us to be more active and follow whatever she guide us.  It took me more than two hours in labor room to push the baby out and she was there to help me, motivate me and when i was not able to do so and giving up in between she\u2019s the one who saved me and my baby. It was difficult time for us and my family but the miracle happened with the grace of god and Dr. Neha. Her motive is to bring out the healthy baby only. Vaginal delivery is far better than cesarean. Keep one thing in mind that normal delivery is temporary pain only as compare to other one. So guys make your mind and go for normal delivery instead of C-section. Thank you so much Doctor for everything.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb. We are blessed to have you as our doctor..\ud83d\ude07",

She showed tremendous love and care throughout our time with her and during our delivery.\n\nI felt incredibly prepared to face everything that was going to be coming my way and it\u2019s a big thanks to Dr. Neha Khandelwal for answering all my questions, hosting informative & helpful classes, creating a pregnant women support group, preparing my husband on how to be involved in the entire process, and going beyond any doctor I\u2019ve ever met! Her concern and love for each patient is abundantly apparent!\n\nDuring our baby\u2019s birth, it was incredible to see Dr. Neha Khandelwal leading her team to fall into place and support me during my entire delivery that took 9 hours total. I can\u2019t tell her enough how much I appreciated her command, positivity, and encouragement on that day!\n\nI would highly recommend Dr. Neha Khandelwal to my friends as she is the doctor you want in your court to help you have the best pregnancy! I know it\u2019s easier said than done, but I would say let go of fear, let go of uncertainty, and fill your mind and heart with the trust of Dr. Neha Khandelwal.",

Her 2 advices I will never forget in my life no matter whats the phase is1) look into one target in one moment ( Sahil has2) life is not a race don't end up comparing your self with others.Since everyone says follow Mam 's instructions which is must.but I would just say one more thing have faith ,her motherly nature will start your parenting and nourishing you and your baby's well being the very first movement you will meet her. I wish I would be a great mother just like her.Thanku so so much Neha Mam.. I will keep showing tantrums to my goddess!!",

She is not only an amazing doctor but  also a true mentor. \n\nI would also want to share my story- When i was pregnant I visited a different doctor for initial 20 weeks, however I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with her. After a lot of research me and my husband came to doctor Neha in the 22nd week and we were were influenced by her in the first visit. She patiently listened to all our questions and made us feel very comfortable. She was all ears to my problems and concerns. After visiting her we were 100% sure that we are in safe hands. Without any second thoughts Dr Neha has my highest recommendation. Please follow her advice and trust me you will do well. I was also sceptical about Normal delivery has i have very low tolerance for pain, Dr Neha patiently listened to me and made sure that i have the best experience of motherhood. \n\nShe keeps a close eye on all her patients and makes sure that she is reachable at any given point of time. \n\nNeha Ma\u2019am- I am falling short of words to thank you for your support and guidance. We are lucky to have you by our side, You have been a fantastic doctor. \n\nFrom Sonal, Satish & Little Princess. ",

I recall feeling quite overwhelmed during my labor pain and making up my mind for C-section delivery, but your constant encouragement kept me going. Your willingness to answer all my questions and provide me with the necessary support made me feel more confident and empowered throughout the process. Your dedication and commitment to your profession are truly inspirational, and you are a precious gem in the hospital. I feel blessed to have you as my doctor. Thank you again for everything.",

Last but not least thanks to her team as well who supported me during the labour pain and delivery. I would highly recommend to all the expected mothers to go for normal delivery if possible...Its a one time pain  with less postpartum  pain ... Thankyou once again to Dr.Neha and her team . (According to my experience I highly recommended Dr.Neha khandelwal. She is very friendly,polite and confident.)",

For a lazy person like me, Dr Neha always pushed me to do regular exercise, eat healthy and drink as much water as possible. She was strict and firm at the same time for which we, are really thankful. The best part is She is always available via phone or whatsapp. For a first time mom like me, there were lot of questions and sometimes at odd hours, but Dr Neha ensured to answer each one of them with patience. Our stay at cloud 9 hospital was super comfortable with nurses and other staff ready to help day and night.\nThanks. ",

My normal delivery was only possible because of her as she kept motivating me to have a normal delivery even with a baby weight of 3.6 kgs . She kept telling me till the end to have it without epidural as that will only delay the process and in my case epidural was not recommended due to my pelvic area issue. I am really thankful to her for her continous support during my entire pregnancy and specially during labour. Words cannot adequately convey the immense appreciation i feel towards her",

During my first pregnancy I was anxious and stressed as the delivery time was coming closer but following doctor\u2019s instructions and trusting her helped me have a relatively short labour period. And the second time also she had told me if I did exercises on time, it would be an easy delivery. Well I can say my labour was very very short.  Doctor Neha is doing a tough and thankless job and I can only show my gratitude towards her and her soft spoken and very cooperative staff.. I would just say that one needn't worry as long as Dr.Neha is around, she\u2019s amazing at her job. ",

Wanted to specially thank Dr. Neha for her constant support through out this journey.\u00a0From the day we met her, she has been available 24x7 to guide us through all our doubts and questions, and this being my first\u00a0pregnancy there have been a fair share of silly doubts :) However Dr. Neha has always been available in calming my anxiety and offering guidance every step of the way. She is definitely the most caring and empathetic doctor. As my husband would say, we simply couldn't have asked for a better doctor. So thank you very much Dr. Neha.",

Even though I asked , she also ensured that I don't use unnecessary drugs/pain reliever and gave us a healthy baby  .\nThis was my 2nd pregnancy and 1st baby was via normal delivery as well from a different gyneo.  However the experience was very different and better this time. Not only delivery, the whole 9 months passed much more  smoothly  and every small or big query was resolved timely. \nShe also focus on post delivery recovery and encourage good diet and exercise.\n\nReally heartful thanks to Dr Neha and her entire team - \n\n\n",

So quick and prompt in her replies, i cannot imagine being under the guidance of any other better doctor around. I came from Aligarh hoping for a better medical treatment and less painful surgery, and instead got a team of lovely and super hardworking people who help u round the clock. Extra thanku to dr Chanchal and coordinator Neha for being by my side and making sure everything was smooth.  Thanku Neha mam. U r truly a gem\ud83d\udc8e",

Throughout my pregnancy Dr. Neha had been very supportive and helpfull. \nThe team of Dr. Neha was very motivating. Continuing in the labour pain, at one point I was so tired and exhausted of pain, that I gave up and was ready for Cesarean delivery. However, Dr. Neha and her team, still found hope and pushed me to try a lit more.... Finally after nearly 8 hours in labour and nearly 1 hr in the room with Dr. Neha and team, I delivered my baby.  I would highly recommend Rainbow Hospital and Dr. Neha to all. Thank you so much doc for all your support for bringing us our little bundle of joy......\n\nThank you..... Sneha & Manoj....",

One of my friend suggested Dr. Neha and whatever he explained about Dr. Neha, was too little. She is more than that. During the first trimester, I was diagnosed with diabetes and thyroid and at that time I was very nervous about my pregnancy, but Dr. Neha always motivated me and managed all things exceptionally. Although She tried a lot to make delivery normal, it could not. Still, I am quite happy with her consultations. I would like to recommend to others and have already started to recommend Dr. Neha to my friends.very big thank you, mam.",

But, my body didn't allowed for normal delivery and i underwent caesarian, the process was smooth and I recovered quickly. All thanks to Dr. Neha. \nDuring the entire time with Dr. Neha I was relaxed and it felt like I am in very safe hands. She is the ideal doctor everyone dreams for.\n\nI wish her all the happiness in the world. God bless. \n\nWith love,\nShruti Priya",

She is an angel guiding us on every step we walk through out our pregnancy and even after that.\nMy journey with Dr. Neha started much before I conceived as I had PCOD and used to consult her. After conceiving, i faced a lot more challenges with increasing BP and water retention with a lot of swelling. But the way Dr. Neha supported in every step was way beyond words.\nMy due date was 1-Aug but due to rising BP, Dr. Neha asked immediately to get a c-sec as waiting might have resulted in unfortunate outcomes. We trusted her without any doubt and that truly paid off.\nFeel blessed to have a doctor like Dr. Neha in your most beautiful journey.\nAgain, a big thank you to Dr. Neha for constant support, her coordinator for a very supportive and friendly attitude and to entire Rainbow team \ud83d\ude42",

We were searching for good Dr to deliver naturally and that became true just because of angel Dr neha. I have never seen such positive and motivated Dr who supported in each and every step. When the day came I still remember she came immediately to see me and advised some steps to make delivery easy. We met Dr. Neha during 2nd Month and we were being made aware of the diet plan, exercises which helped in having normal delivery. Because of your positivity and great smiles, we always felt like we were in good hands and that gave us peace of mind towards the big day. Thank you for helping deliver the most precious gift of our life. Hospital staff members are also very nice and really motivated to have normal delivery.",

After a lot of research we reached out Dr Neha and when we met her for the first time we concluded she is the one. Her positive attitude, to the point conversation and explaination of everything I asked her was just amazing. She was truly like a guide to me who answered all my queries all throughout and made my journey so easy. Though I had a healthy pregnancy and there were no issues ever bt towards the end the moment she sensed something she without wasting time changed the plan and decided to deliver in 37th week. Most importantly knowing that I am emotionally weak she always heard me well before she answered and was always there for support. Dr Neha is truly a blessing to all the mothers who are planning to deliver with her. Thank you so much Dr Neha for accepting my decisions. * * *** **** *** I am glad I met you in my beautiful journey.",

She is such a sensitive doctor and has that personal touch with her patients that half of our concerns would fade away just by talking to her. The way she councils made me so confident in this entire journey.  I think we all are fortunate to have her as our doctor. I would advise all  the mommies to be  to listen to what she says and follow her blindly.    Much regards Neha mam. Finding a doctor like you in this world is like finding a rare gem.",

Me and my husband followed all her instructions to do exercise and eating right. Which helped me reach my natural delivery stage faster. But even then I had lost my will power to the contractions n pains. It was doctor Neha and her extremely supportive and soft spoken staff who took all my tantrums with a smile and understood my condition. And it was their hard work and my husband\u2019s belief in what doctor Neha had suggested us that turned my last minute fear of not being able deliver naturally into an easy and fast process. I advice all of you to follow whatever our doctor suggests. She knows it best!! \ud83d\ude0a",

I have had a long labour and lost all my strength and hope. In today's easy going world Dr Neha khandelwal still kept forcing me to deliver normal. She not just pushed me   to wait and do normal delivery but also councelled me like a guardian. Her unconditional support throughout the journey has made it special. I would like to suggest everyone to listen to Dr. Neha Khandelwal without any second thoughts. She would do the best for you also, her advice would help to make the process easy for you. I would also like to suggest take an extra mile and do lot of excercise as suggested by her. It will help you deliver faster and easily. Again, thank you so much Dr Neha khandelwal for all your support, love and care",

Even though patient came with delayed period only , a full preconceptional advice was given and this is documented on prescription.  . The patient even visited again to show blood reports and was not charged a penny . The follow up advice presciption has also been uploaded on practo . The reader must note that on the basis of reports , treatment was also started .Seeing on the follow up day without charging proves that we tried to give you the required amount of time . Your first consultation was for 15 min as per the slot and we have your in time and out time too.\nBefore trying to defame anyone , pls check all facts . \nIf 99 percent patients say on Practo I give enough time and have never been rude and reader should note this .\nIt\u2019s disheartening for a doctor to read such false allegations  and an attempt to defamation legal notice should be sent to this patient .",
