She is Polite and friendly, Dr. Anita Aggarwal attended to all my queries and doubts throughout my pregnancy just as a mother would do. She really cared and concerned about me (literally too much even though my case had got complicated from 6th month due to diabetes , high liver infection, high bile acid etc. )  From the smallest to the biggest of my problems, her compassion and love has always taken half my problem away.  I had decided that she will be my doctor for life.\nWhen I visited you first I was relaxed that I am in  safe  hands.\nI would highly recommend her to all would-be-mothers.\n\nThanks ma\u2019am for everything and my BUNDLE OF JOY \ud83d\ude0a.",
