Even at the time of delivery when my wife was going through the labour pain she was the shining light who has given me hope that everything will be normal and their is no need to worry, and not even once she ever thought of delivering baby via c-section.

She waited for almost 40 hrs for getting my baby delivered via natural delivery process, and now both my wife and baby are fine to which I and my family is indebted to her.",
