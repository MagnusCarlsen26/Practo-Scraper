Not only me me but my baby feel connected to her voice and aura during those 9 months.\ni am giving this feedback in two parts, one how she is as a person and another as a doctor.\n\nPerson:- I feel your behaviour matters when you are doctor, at the end they are also human being with medical gift. She is outrightly one of most modest person despite being so successful. I love the way she handles financial subjects very clear cut ,considerate and realist. You can ask and she will clarify all the financial queries of yours. Infact she will be considerate about your money and her response is so apt. She is practical and yet you are her precious patient whom she cares a lot. She has a bit of philosophical side which puts you at such a ease while talking to her\n\nDoctor- complete knowledge about her field, you just have to ask the right question. I have visited her clinic mostly and fortis hospital in the 3rd trimester. During every visit she will do her observation with concentration then will give you time to ask your queries. I feel she finds her clinic very close to her heart and very caring in that space. She did forget me as a patient during the initial trimester but again cant pinpoint her for that. I liked her as a person and her positive aura as a doctor. I have understood her nature and showed my honest trust on her advice. \n\nProcedure: My 9 month of pregnancy was less complicated and same feeling was created by Dr. Mamta Mishra. There was subserosal fibroid but that didn\u2019t interfere with pregnancy. I chose to  get delivered by Ma\u2019am hence chose fortis as my delivery hospital. At the end there was slight issue of gestational diabetics which might have been resulted in insulin injection but not needed at the end. After 38 week I was given induced labor pain under the guidance of Mamta ma\u2019am which was successful and i delivered a healthy baby after 12 hrs of induction process. There was flow of blood from Utreus after delivery whose reason was unknown. But ma\u2019am was able to stop the blood flow and stopped the mishappening , the procedure took another 1 hr and episiotomy stitched given by ma\u2019am was perfectly intact. I am writing this 1 week after my delivery. \n\nI would recommend every aspiring pregnant women to her for better guidance and relaxing 9 months. If any further information needed please reach out.\n\nThankyou Mamta Ma\u2019am\nEvery meeting with you was soothing in its own way.",

Then you meet Dr. Mamta mishra and all your belief's in doctor's are restored.\nThis goes same as every politician is corrupt except few who try to maintain moral ethics and work to help others. She is one of them! The only doctor (out of all those i know) who follow medical ethics.\nYou will NEVER be disappointed consulting her.\nShe motivated me and my wife for normal delivery throughout and at the time of delivery i was about to give up seeing my wife in pain and then she came and motivated my wife to go for normal delivery though we delivered it in fortis and i have had very bad experience with fortis that i had it in mind that the doctor will go for C section at the end saying there is no other option without even trying as what a trend is going on but mam(Dr.mamta mishra) did not even offer C section and went for normal delivery.\nAt the end of the day we have a baby and she has all our respect for restoring faith in doctors.\n\nNow lets come to financials\nShe will try to save your money as much as you try\nLet me give you an example which touched me and my wife. One day we had an ultrasound scheduled and mam did ultrasound for more than a hour and at the end she wanted some more clarification in ultrasound so she recommended 2nd advice and after standing for more than an hour she did not charge a single penny.\nAnd there are n number of incidents like this\nAnd before consulting her we went to a doctor who was charging money for almost every thing in fact she tried to go for a specific labs for test to get commission.\n\nShe(Dr Mamta Mishra) is always on your side! If you go once you will never consult any other doctor\n\nI am writing this review while she is examining my wife for discharge and the word she said that she does not want to keep my wife admitted because she doesn't want to put more burden on our pockets!\n\nAnd to help you!\nFortis charged Rs.64000 (as we took general ward package which is totally great as fortis maintains high cleanliness quality standards) for delivery including everything as we had a normal delivery. This cost will increase by Rs.12000 if you opt for epidural which we didn't and also Rs.10000 willbe added if you go for C Section\n\nThank you mam and staff of fortis which is as nice as Dr.Mamta mishra mam\n\nThis 9899020718 is my no if you need any guidance(This is the least i can do fr the Dr.Mamta Mishra)\n\nSumit Grover",

I believe we have very few doctors like her in today's world. \r\nI would like to give her feedback on following grounds.\r\n\r\n1. Subject Knowledge : \r\nShe is MRCOG from UK and this is evident while she talks to her Patients.  She keep herself updated with the recent studies in Gynecology. Avoid giving unnecessary medications   or treatment.  Her Knowledge in the field of Gynecology is brilliant. Before visiting her I Visited many Gynecologists of NCR. But no one impressed as DR Mishra did. After meeting her My respect for this Noble Profession has increased thousand times .\r\n\r\n2. Honesty & Work Ethics\r\n\r\nHer honest Qualities and Work ethics also impressed me. Dr Mishra Practices the Hippocratic oath in reality. \"Patient  is  supreme not money\" is her motto. She is a doctor with moral values and medical ethics. I am fortunate to have our baby delivered(Normal delivery)  by her on Nov 7th 2015. She guides correctly and never ever will keep you in the dark which the majority of the doctors do. I salute such doctors for whom the patient is supreme.\r\n\r\n3. Work Style: She is available 24*7. If her mobile is off by chance she  responds you back, the moment she sees you call.  Her clear dealings and work style also impressed me. She guides very patiently over the phone as well.\r\n\r\nTo Conclude : If you are looking for gynecologist you must Visit DR Mishra otherwise you will miss the BEST DOCTOR IN NCR. We use travel from Ghaziabad to Vasant Kunj for her consultation \r\n\r\nOnce Again : My High REGARDS for DR. Mamta Mishra\r\n\r\nSuyash prasad \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

And I thought lets just try for the last time before I decide.\nThen I visited Dr Mamta and she reviewed all my ultrasound reports in detailed and provided me detailed information about the Endometriosis & Fibroids. I was so happy and positive to see how a busy doctor can spend so much time on your case. She mentioned that I have to undergo Endometriosis and fibroid removal surgery because the fibroids & Endo are too big in size and they are blocking my pregnancy. She said she will try for laparoscopic myomectomy but the chances are low. I was so positive with Dr Mamta and decided to get this surgery done. March 2021 was the month of my surgery, Dr Mamta tried her best and removed all my fibroids with \u201cLaparoscopic Myomectomy\u201d. The surgery took almost 6-7 hour but she spent her whole day on my surgery so that I don\u2019t have to suffer with \u201cOpen myomectomy\u201d. After my surgery, she asked me to be positive for my pregnancy as she tried her best to not to touch my uterus, tubes and ovaries during suregry. \n\nIn July 2021, I got pregnant naturally. ** **** **** *** ** *** ** *** **** ****** * **** **** *** ** ** **** *** I would highly recommend all to please do not loose hopes and must visit Dr Mamta Mishra before you decide anything.

If you want to trust the natural process of delivery, you will not find a doc as good as her. The pregnancy experience which she creates will have a life long impact on you as few things like \u201ctrust your body\u201d is very rare to come straight from doctor\u2019s mouth. \n\nWe had heard so much around pregnancy around us that we were actually afraid if we will be able to manage that. But her simple advices, 24/7 availability for your problems, calm and composed approch to your issues, her motivation in labor room and no extra expense are just few to state.\n\nOnly doc I have visited recently who does not have any tie up with any lab and you can get your tests done anywhere you want, No issues of medicines being available at a particular shop (you will easily get anywhere and they are not expensive), no supplements till it is actually required as she will motivate you to get those from natural food are again just few things you will love about her.\n\nIt would not have been possible for us to have such a smooth vaginal delivery experience without her.\n\nDo visit her for a stress free and pocket friendly delivery experience.\n\nRegards \nProud parents of Vedant Singh",

She encourages for normal delivery if it is medically safe and if not she will recommend a caesarian. She is not biased.In my case she put in all efforts to deliver my baby normally and after putting in all time and effort when baby was still not coming she swiftly went and prepared the operation theatre for emergency caesarian. She did not jump to doing caesarian without trying nor did she delay when she knew cesarian was inevitable.Another good thing is She always responds to all telephonic conversations despite her busy schedule. She will see the reports online and respond even at odd hours and won't ask you to come to clinic unnecessarily.I am extremely thankful to Dr. Mamta for making the process so smooth for me .",

Dr. Mamta Mishra is one of such doctors. I started consulting in my 5th month after having an unsatisfactory experience with my previous gynaecologist who categorized my pregnancy as high risk and suggested complete bed rest. It was only after I met Dr. Mamta that I started feeling confident being pregnant and got back on my feet, doing regular chores without any unnecessary fears. She doesn't treat pregnancy as sickness and encourage you to enjoy the journey to its fullest. \n\nFast forward to labour and delivery woes during last trimester, she made us understand our options and helped us take the right decisions at the right time. Unlike most Gynaecologist in India, she and her entire team were very flexible and encouraged me to try out different methods to cope up with painful contractions. My labour and delivery experience was beyond satisfactory and I am glad that with the right support I could deliver normally without any unnecessary medication or need for an emergency C-section. Recovery has been great too! \n\nI would highly recommend Dr. Mamta Mishra to all women looking for a compassionate and genuine doctor to support their pregnancy. * **** ****** ****** ***** *** *** ***********",

I still remember the day when my wife gave me the good news that soon we are going to have a cute baby in our life with this my search begin for a good doctor.In this era of internet i begin my search with practo and came across the profile of Dr. Mamta Mishra where i found all the feedbacks favourable to visit her. She is very polite who always encourages to go for normal delivery. She always provide ample amount of time to the patient being at face to face or on phone call. At times i bothered her during the odd times on call but she always provided the solution. One can send the reports to her on whatsapp and discuss it over call that act as saviour when you are out of town and cannot make a visit to her. She will not put you on lots of medicines rather encourage to have more fruits, vegetables,pulses etc. She understand the query of patients very well and explains the situation with all pros and cons and does not make you panic for unnecessary things.What i most like about her is the personal touch and understanding she renders in helping the patients.We wished normal delivery and it was the trust on her which gave us strength and made it happen. She put all her efforts for it.I would recommend anyone who is seeking medical advice related to gynae to visit Dr. Mishra. Once you visit her you will not go to any other doctor.",

Not only me me but my baby feel connected to her voice and aura during those 9 months.\ni am giving this feedback in two parts, one how she is as a person and another as a doctor.\n\nPerson:- I feel your behaviour matters when you are doctor, at the end they are also human being with medical gift. She is outrightly one of most modest person despite being so successful. I love the way she handles financial subjects very clear cut ,considerate and realist. You can ask and she will clarify all the financial queries of yours. Infact she will be considerate about your money and her response is so apt. She is practical and yet you are her precious patient whom she cares a lot. She has a bit of philosophical side which puts you at such a ease while talking to her\n\nDoctor- complete knowledge about her field, you just have to ask the right question. I have visited her clinic mostly and fortis hospital in the 3rd trimester. During every visit she will do her observation with concentration then will give you time to ask your queries. I feel she finds her clinic very close to her heart and very caring in that space. She did forget me as a patient during the initial trimester but again cant pinpoint her for that. I liked her as a person and her positive aura as a doctor. I have understood her nature and showed my honest trust on her advice. \n\nProcedure: My 9 month of pregnancy was less complicated and same feeling was created by Dr. Mamta Mishra. There was subserosal fibroid but that didn\u2019t interfere with pregnancy. I chose to  get delivered by Ma\u2019am hence chose fortis as my delivery hospital. At the end there was slight issue of gestational diabetics which might have been resulted in insulin injection but not needed at the end. After 38 week I was given induced labor pain under the guidance of Mamta ma\u2019am which was successful and i delivered a healthy baby after 12 hrs of induction process. There was flow of blood from Utreus after delivery whose reason was unknown. But ma\u2019am was able to stop the blood flow and stopped the mishappening , the procedure took another 1 hr and episiotomy stitched given by ma\u2019am was perfectly intact. I am writing this 1 week after my delivery. \n\nI would recommend every aspiring pregnant women to her for better guidance and relaxing 9 months. If any further information needed please reach out.\n\nThankyou Mamta Ma\u2019am\nEvery meeting with you was soothing in its own way.",

Then you meet Dr. Mamta mishra and all your belief's in doctor's are restored.\nThis goes same as every politician is corrupt except few who try to maintain moral ethics and work to help others. She is one of them! The only doctor (out of all those i know) who follow medical ethics.\nYou will NEVER be disappointed consulting her.\nShe motivated me and my wife for normal delivery throughout and at the time of delivery i was about to give up seeing my wife in pain and then she came and motivated my wife to go for normal delivery though we delivered it in fortis and i have had very bad experience with fortis that i had it in mind that the doctor will go for C section at the end saying there is no other option without even trying as what a trend is going on but mam(Dr.mamta mishra) did not even offer C section and went for normal delivery.\nAt the end of the day we have a baby and she has all our respect for restoring faith in doctors.\n\nNow lets come to financials\nShe will try to save your money as much as you try\nLet me give you an example which touched me and my wife. One day we had an ultrasound scheduled and mam did ultrasound for more than a hour and at the end she wanted some more clarification in ultrasound so she recommended 2nd advice and after standing for more than an hour she did not charge a single penny.\nAnd there are n number of incidents like this\nAnd before consulting her we went to a doctor who was charging money for almost every thing in fact she tried to go for a specific labs for test to get commission.\n\nShe(Dr Mamta Mishra) is always on your side! If you go once you will never consult any other doctor\n\nI am writing this review while she is examining my wife for discharge and the word she said that she does not want to keep my wife admitted because she doesn't want to put more burden on our pockets!\n\nAnd to help you!\nFortis charged Rs.64000 (as we took general ward package which is totally great as fortis maintains high cleanliness quality standards) for delivery including everything as we had a normal delivery. This cost will increase by Rs.12000 if you opt for epidural which we didn't and also Rs.10000 willbe added if you go for C Section\n\nThank you mam and staff of fortis which is as nice as Dr.Mamta mishra mam\n\nThis 9899020718 is my no if you need any guidance(This is the least i can do fr the Dr.Mamta Mishra)\n\nSumit Grover",

I believe we have very few doctors like her in today's world. \r\nI would like to give her feedback on following grounds.\r\n\r\n1. Subject Knowledge : \r\nShe is MRCOG from UK and this is evident while she talks to her Patients.  She keep herself updated with the recent studies in Gynecology. Avoid giving unnecessary medications   or treatment.  Her Knowledge in the field of Gynecology is brilliant. Before visiting her I Visited many Gynecologists of NCR. But no one impressed as DR Mishra did. After meeting her My respect for this Noble Profession has increased thousand times .\r\n\r\n2. Honesty & Work Ethics\r\n\r\nHer honest Qualities and Work ethics also impressed me. Dr Mishra Practices the Hippocratic oath in reality. \"Patient  is  supreme not money\" is her motto. She is a doctor with moral values and medical ethics. I am fortunate to have our baby delivered(Normal delivery)  by her on Nov 7th 2015. She guides correctly and never ever will keep you in the dark which the majority of the doctors do. I salute such doctors for whom the patient is supreme.\r\n\r\n3. Work Style: She is available 24*7. If her mobile is off by chance she  responds you back, the moment she sees you call.  Her clear dealings and work style also impressed me. She guides very patiently over the phone as well.\r\n\r\nTo Conclude : If you are looking for gynecologist you must Visit DR Mishra otherwise you will miss the BEST DOCTOR IN NCR. We use travel from Ghaziabad to Vasant Kunj for her consultation \r\n\r\nOnce Again : My High REGARDS for DR. Mamta Mishra\r\n\r\nSuyash prasad \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

And I thought lets just try for the last time before I decide.\nThen I visited Dr Mamta and she reviewed all my ultrasound reports in detailed and provided me detailed information about the Endometriosis & Fibroids. I was so happy and positive to see how a busy doctor can spend so much time on your case. She mentioned that I have to undergo Endometriosis and fibroid removal surgery because the fibroids & Endo are too big in size and they are blocking my pregnancy. She said she will try for laparoscopic myomectomy but the chances are low. I was so positive with Dr Mamta and decided to get this surgery done. March 2021 was the month of my surgery, Dr Mamta tried her best and removed all my fibroids with \u201cLaparoscopic Myomectomy\u201d. The surgery took almost 6-7 hour but she spent her whole day on my surgery so that I don\u2019t have to suffer with \u201cOpen myomectomy\u201d. After my surgery, she asked me to be positive for my pregnancy as she tried her best to not to touch my uterus, tubes and ovaries during suregry. \n\nIn July 2021, I got pregnant naturally. ** **** **** *** ** *** ** *** **** ****** * **** **** *** ** ** **** *** I would highly recommend all to please do not loose hopes and must visit Dr Mamta Mishra before you decide anything.

If you want to trust the natural process of delivery, you will not find a doc as good as her. The pregnancy experience which she creates will have a life long impact on you as few things like \u201ctrust your body\u201d is very rare to come straight from doctor\u2019s mouth. \n\nWe had heard so much around pregnancy around us that we were actually afraid if we will be able to manage that. But her simple advices, 24/7 availability for your problems, calm and composed approch to your issues, her motivation in labor room and no extra expense are just few to state.\n\nOnly doc I have visited recently who does not have any tie up with any lab and you can get your tests done anywhere you want, No issues of medicines being available at a particular shop (you will easily get anywhere and they are not expensive), no supplements till it is actually required as she will motivate you to get those from natural food are again just few things you will love about her.\n\nIt would not have been possible for us to have such a smooth vaginal delivery experience without her.\n\nDo visit her for a stress free and pocket friendly delivery experience.\n\nRegards \nProud parents of Vedant Singh",

She encourages for normal delivery if it is medically safe and if not she will recommend a caesarian. She is not biased.In my case she put in all efforts to deliver my baby normally and after putting in all time and effort when baby was still not coming she swiftly went and prepared the operation theatre for emergency caesarian. She did not jump to doing caesarian without trying nor did she delay when she knew cesarian was inevitable.Another good thing is She always responds to all telephonic conversations despite her busy schedule. She will see the reports online and respond even at odd hours and won't ask you to come to clinic unnecessarily.I am extremely thankful to Dr. Mamta for making the process so smooth for me .",

Dr. Mamta Mishra is one of such doctors. I started consulting in my 5th month after having an unsatisfactory experience with my previous gynaecologist who categorized my pregnancy as high risk and suggested complete bed rest. It was only after I met Dr. Mamta that I started feeling confident being pregnant and got back on my feet, doing regular chores without any unnecessary fears. She doesn't treat pregnancy as sickness and encourage you to enjoy the journey to its fullest. \n\nFast forward to labour and delivery woes during last trimester, she made us understand our options and helped us take the right decisions at the right time. Unlike most Gynaecologist in India, she and her entire team were very flexible and encouraged me to try out different methods to cope up with painful contractions. My labour and delivery experience was beyond satisfactory and I am glad that with the right support I could deliver normally without any unnecessary medication or need for an emergency C-section. Recovery has been great too! \n\nI would highly recommend Dr. Mamta Mishra to all women looking for a compassionate and genuine doctor to support their pregnancy. * **** ****** ****** ***** *** *** ***********",

I still remember the day when my wife gave me the good news that soon we are going to have a cute baby in our life with this my search begin for a good doctor.In this era of internet i begin my search with practo and came across the profile of Dr. Mamta Mishra where i found all the feedbacks favourable to visit her. She is very polite who always encourages to go for normal delivery. She always provide ample amount of time to the patient being at face to face or on phone call. At times i bothered her during the odd times on call but she always provided the solution. One can send the reports to her on whatsapp and discuss it over call that act as saviour when you are out of town and cannot make a visit to her. She will not put you on lots of medicines rather encourage to have more fruits, vegetables,pulses etc. She understand the query of patients very well and explains the situation with all pros and cons and does not make you panic for unnecessary things.What i most like about her is the personal touch and understanding she renders in helping the patients.We wished normal delivery and it was the trust on her which gave us strength and made it happen. She put all her efforts for it.I would recommend anyone who is seeking medical advice related to gynae to visit Dr. Mishra. Once you visit her you will not go to any other doctor.",

There few complications in our case. \nWe found her treatment to be very professional taking care of all the possibilities.  Her more than two decades of experience  was visible in her treatment. She used to explain the things to us and also, addresses any query regarding anything . \nShe has a very friendly approach towards patients. She is available on mobile in case of any emergency / urgent appointment. Even many a times, we used to watsapp the report if nothing else was required in that visit .\nMore than all this, we found her to be a lot more empathetic towards patients in comparison to other doctors ( we were consulting in Moolchand before her ). There's a personal touch to your case . She does her best to take care of everything. \nMy wife opted for C section herself due to her suffering from minor heart issue (MVP) and we were scared after the complications in early stages of pregnancy. The doc said that normal delivery could be carried out, but only if she agrees. \n\nI wud definitely rate her 10/10 for her care and advises and wud visit her in future for related treatments for my wife. \n",

No unnecessary tests or consultations or making you go for C sec just to make money. She even did not let me take an epidural :).\n\nThanks Dr. Mamta, you have been a life saviour.",

We still asked her if we could go for any alternate way. She explained in details about the other ways and clearly stated the success rate , she calmed us and pursued us to try it naturally. All went well by Gods grace and I delivered a healthy baby. She has always been very helpful like a guardian pre , during and post pregnancy.

In the end, due to her support n encouragement I was able to deliver the baby normal. This is very much unlike the current scenario where the Doctors are very willing to go for a c section.I would highly recommend her as a Gynaecologist.",

Even in the labor room, she made her calm, discussed things with my wife before making any important decision. My wife's decision was given priority. There were chances in labor room, where it seemed that Doctors would go for C section.

She will never force you to visit all the time, from time to time she will ask you to send the soft copy of reports and if all OK you just need to follow the things as recommended.\n\nWe always wish for normal delivery and she is the one who actually made it happen. She always give you strength and push for normal delivery also ask you to have more vegetables and fruits along with normal workout rather than lot of medicines.\n\nThank you so much for all your friendliness, support and valuable guidance during the last 9 months.\n\nI would recommend her to everyone.\n",

Everyone was convinced including myself that it will be a C-Section but Dr Mishra insisted on natural delivery. I trusted her and she didn\u2019t disappoint me. Finally I gave a birth through normal delivery.\n It was a preterm birth and my baby was admitted to the nursery for a week. There also Dr. Mishra was keeping a watch on my baby health and taking regular feedbacks from other doctors. I have never met a doctor who is so involved with their patients. Dr. Mishra is truly amazing\n",

She has always provided the absolute best care, and I believe, best advice and treatment during every visit and for every issue. She is the only one who motivated me through out my pregnancy for normal delivery despite me diagnosed with other decease. Thanks to her motivation and support i had a normal delivery. I would highly recommend Dr Mamta Mishra. She is the Best of the best. Thanks Mam for all your Help and Support.",

We visited her clinic in Vasant Kunj every month and apart from that she is always available over phone for any guidance. Even she calls back as well. We are thankful to her for making our pregnancy journey pleasant and safe. We would highly recommend her. ",

When the baby was born he had an undeveloped sixth finger in his right hand. Just after delivery one of the doctors at Fortis told that the extra muscle will be cut off in a while but later I was told that the estimated cost of removing the muscle will be Rs 56000. \nAlso a sense of very high level of urgency was maintained that there can be severe implications if the muscle isn't removed ASAP.\nI Called Dr Mamta and made her aware of the whole story. You will be surprised to hear that not only she calmed us down but also took care of the muscle almost free of cost(compare 56000 with a mere 700 consulting fee).\n\nI will just say that if in the current era of business minded doctors if you want an honest professional she is the one to go to.

She explains each and everything in such a detail that is awesome , I have never seen any doctor sitting and talking to their patients and guiding them which is why she is such a good counsellor as well.\nHer advices are superb , I use to visit her for my pregnancy and during my entire tenure she treated me the best way , me and my family were highly satisfied with her which is why we refer others also to see her . During my every visit she helped me a lot . She use to be always available on call as well as WhatsApp whenever I required. I had never seen any doctor doing that other than her.\nIn case you are searching for a good gynaecologist in NCR then Dr Mamta  Mishra is the one *** *** **** **** *",
