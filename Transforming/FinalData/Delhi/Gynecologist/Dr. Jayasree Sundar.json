I had gone through recurrent miscarraiges in past, and have visited several big/expert doctors but never ever felt the way I did after meeting Jayasree mam. Bcoz we had gone through lot in past, we have slowly gained good understanding of things related to pregnancy and on the first meeting with Jayashree mam, ** **** ** **** ******* ***** *** **** ******* *** ** ************** caring and someone we can fully trust. Also Because of recurrent miscarriages I had lost all hope and had decided that it was my last attempt. \nIt was only and only because of her I got the inner strength and finally delivered a baby boy. Every meeting with her was exceptional, not only was she able to diagnose everything perfectly because of her experience, it also boosted my confidence and made me stronger from inside. I could always feel that this time it's going to be all good. On the delivery date as well, I was admant for a Csection but Mam didn't lose hope , she said no matter what I won't do csection as there is no need since both mother and child are perfectly fine. She held my hand, served me juice and gave me motivation regularly. Then after 2-3 hours of pain which is good thing as it helps in pushing baby down , she gave epidural and my labor pain vanished temporarily , which helped a lot as I was able to apply force without feeling pain and got courage and comfort for normal delivery.\nNot sure how to put the whole experience in words but It was only because of her I finally delivered a Baby boy normally. May God always keep her healthy and young. *** ** *** **** ****** * **** *** **** ***** Don't think twice, just meet her once. ",

I had gone through recurrent miscarraiges in past, and have visited several big/expert doctors but never ever felt the way I did after meeting Jayasree mam. Bcoz we had gone through lot in past, we have slowly gained good understanding of things related to pregnancy and on the first meeting with Jayashree mam, ** **** ** **** ******* ***** *** **** ******* *** ** ************** caring and someone we can fully trust. Also Because of recurrent miscarriages I had lost all hope and had decided that it was my last attempt. \nIt was only and only because of her I got the inner strength and finally delivered a baby boy. Every meeting with her was exceptional, not only was she able to diagnose everything perfectly because of her experience, it also boosted my confidence and made me stronger from inside. I could always feel that this time it's going to be all good. On the delivery date as well, I was admant for a Csection but Mam didn't lose hope , she said no matter what I won't do csection as there is no need since both mother and child are perfectly fine. She held my hand, served me juice and gave me motivation regularly. Then after 2-3 hours of pain which is good thing as it helps in pushing baby down , she gave epidural and my labor pain vanished temporarily , which helped a lot as I was able to apply force without feeling pain and got courage and comfort for normal delivery.\nNot sure how to put the whole experience in words but It was only because of her I finally delivered a Baby boy normally. May God always keep her healthy and young. *** ** *** **** ****** * **** *** **** ***** Don't think twice, just meet her once. ",
