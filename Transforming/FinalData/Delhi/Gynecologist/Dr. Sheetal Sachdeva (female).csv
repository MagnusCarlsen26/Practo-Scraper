I started seeing Dr. Sheetal based on practo stories. I visited her for entire pregnancy many times. Not even once i could find anything that is mentioned by people in their stories. She gets easily offended by questions. There is no personal touch by the way. She never seem bothered by my anxiety. Every body and every pregnancy is different. She literally scolded me and my husband on call when I was in labour and pressurized us to take a decision in few minutes. At that moment in hospital during labour I felt how unlucky I am to have a doctor so rude. I was traumatized after my cesarean 
now after 2 months i have got enough stability to think about what happened to me.
While Reading other stories i felt..did i pay less or what? I don't know where was her friendliness and approachable nature in my case. She never explained me the procedure i might go through so that i can take an informed decision. Upon asking she scolded ""make a decision first""
On my latest appointment where i asked her whether i can clean my pubic hair above the stitches. She said yes. I confirmed whether i can use hair removal creams...she got irritated and said...i am not going to discuss this now..i said you can remove so do whatever you like.
I think during my journey i kept on hoping that may be she is good based on practo stories and i should keep patience...today i regret that. I shouldn't have waited.
