Apart from long waiting time (1.5 hour) even after taking the appointment 2 days in advance the most disturbing thing was the behaviour of doctor.

The interesting part it, once you go to her clinic, her receptionist does not charge you before seeing the doctor. Instead she insists to first let the doctor examine you and then you can pay her.

Though her receptionist prompted her that the report is negative but she continued to scare me and my mother and later got to me convincing to get vaccine from her clinic.
