I had gone from countless pediatricians to countless gynecologists and urologists explaining my symptoms, to no end. I used to have a burning sensation on peeing every time and sometimes it would get so bad that I would bleed from my urethra. I would be inside an emergency room howling with pain every 3 months. I would explain my symptoms endlessly to the on-call doctors the follow-up Gynecologist or the urologist in the OPD the next day, just to be told that my symptoms were not that severe and I must have had early period spotting. I was always handed a pack of antibiotics for Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) and pain medication and sent on my way. I had really lost my faith in medical science for women to the point I would go to the emergency room and never go for the follow-up OPD as I knew exactly what I would be prescribed - an overly strong anti-biotic and pain meds followed by \"drink cranberry juice or have cranberry supplements\". I discovered so much medication for myself on my own by reading on the internet and started experimenting and trying to increase my pain threshold. Until one day I came across Dr. Karishma's profile and I decided to get on a video consultation with her. She did not dismiss my pain. She did not dismiss my claim to have blood in my urine or coming from my urethra. She was the first doctor to believe me and she told me that I maybe don't have UTI in the first place and maybe this is a bigger problem. she called me in for a physical examination and for the first time it was informed to me to get to the root of my problem I diagnostic procedure called cystoscopy will have to be performed. I underwent the cystoscopy which she herself performed on me. she took care of me after the procedure to ensure I was not in any kind of pain. And after that, she gave me the diagnosis that I had been searching for my entire life - interstitial cystitis. It is a chronic disease of the bladder which causes UTI-like symptoms but is not UTI. She started my treatment course. And ever since I walked into her office, I have not had to see the insides of an emergency room again. it has been 11 months. She has helped me greatly with my condition. I do not have to live in fear of peeing anymore. I can finally pee pain-free all thanks to her. and my bladder has not bled once since I met her.  She is a brilliant urogynecologist, the smartest doctor I have met in my life, and the friendliest and most caring person. She will move her schedule around her patients' needs. She will listen patiently and without any judgment. She even helped me with my extremely painful period cramps due to PCOS, which would render me bed-ridden for many days. She has been the best thing to happen to me. ",

Symptoms were a very slow stream, frequent use of toilet (every hour) and frequent cases of UTI. After spending 2 years with top urologists in the US, my problem did not resolve. I was told this would stay for lifetime and the only way was to do self catheterization.\n\nI reached out to Dr. Karishma via Practo for an opinion. I liked her approach very much that I decided to visit Delhi for treatment. She was very systematic in diagnosing the problem. She explained to me all possible causes of high urinary retention and started ruling out reasons one at a time, by running the necessary tests like Uroflowmetry, Urodynamics, MCU. She was super patient in answering my many questions. Her explanations were logical and she made it easy to understand and follow along why certain tests are needed and the treatment that would follow. The root cause was found to be a urethral stricture. This was unexpected for a person of young age like me especially given that I had no history of any surgery or childbirth. Dr. Karishma led the cystoscopy and surgery to remove the stricture. During my entire stay, she involved other doctors from her team as well to get a second opinion as needed. I did my visits at Sama Hospital, the staff at hospital was very cooperative and  supportive which made my visits very comfortable. \n\nDr. Karishma fixed my problem 100%. The flow of urine stream improved drastically!  \nInstead of going to the toilet 12-13 times a day, I went to the toilet 4-5 times a day like a person with a normal bladder. I never had to do self catheterization on a daily basis like what the doctors in the US had recommended. Since I don\u2019t have to use the toilet frequently, I am able to do day to day activities without having to worry about being around the toilet every hour whether it is at a restaurant, a place outside home, the office, the parks, etc. Getting treatment from Dr. Karishma has been a huge blessing for me. I am highly thankful and grateful to her for bringing my life back to normal.",

                "review_text": "I can't thank Dr. Karishma enough. So here goes my story. In July, 2020, I experienced burning sensation while passing urine. I consulted a doctor & was prescribed with antibiotics. I took two courses of antibiotics. The burning sensation left but the pain & tenderness never went away. Further, I consulted several doctors (including specialists) who diagnosed me with UTI (even though my urine reports were coming normal). I was prescribed with antibiotics, antifungals & cranberry syrup. However, I didn't find any relief. I kept asking doctors if I have Bladder Pain Syndrome but didn't get any satisfactory answer. With each passing day my misery & anxiety kept on increasing. Then one day I randomly searched for Urogynaecologists on Google & came across Dr. Karishma. I read the feedbacks on the Practo app & could relate with many patients who had similar problem like mine. In the first visit itself, Dr. Karishma told me what was going wrong with my body & explained everything very calmly to me & my parents. She did a cystoscopy to confirm my condition & I was diagnosed with Bladder Pain Syndrome / Interstitial Cystitis. Then she started my treatment which included strict diet, bladder instillations, pelvic floor physiotherapy (very important part) apart from oral medications. Two months down the treatment I would say I am in a much better condition. During each visit, Dr. Karishma fills me with so much positivity & she has always guided me very well. The best part about her is that she is extremely sincere & dedicated towards her work & she's very punctual. She has a very positive & friendly attitude towards her patients because of which I didn't hesitate in asking her any questions. If anyone has any bladder related issues, I would highly recommend them to consult Dr. Karishma who not only identified my problem but has also given me with solutions. Thank you Dr. Karishma. :) ",

First time we met with Dr. Karishma with no wait. She politely explained the problem in very detail so we could understand what's the problem is in general terms.\n\nShe treated us in the way that we became friends at first visit. She explained the course of treatment of fistula developed between bladder and uterus, which requires operation to repair fistula. She given us hope to us that this will get away without any problem.\n\nThe following night, after the surgery, Dr. Karishma was up whole night to see my messages, where she asked me to monitor and text her the urine output every hour. I was so relieved seeing her dedication and taking care of her patient.\n\nShe was very supportive throughout and before and after the treatment and very flexible in getting appointments with our ease. She cheered my wife always when she sees my wifes's tensed face.\n\nShe is very humble, caring and friendly doctor I have ever met. She is  very specialist in her field and provide best treatment which is best for the patient. We are so happy and luckiest that we consulted first with you Dr. Karishma.\n\nShe made over lives easier especially my wife's life. We are totally satisfied with her treatment. She has all the qualities that a Doctor should have.\n\nAgain, Thanks a lot and blessed always with smiles. We will miss her cute smile :-)",

After numerous short term treatments with various urologists and gynaechologists, one doctor reffered me to Dr. karishma, who is uro gynaechologist.  Before this I was not even aware that there is uro gynaechology also. She is one of the most patient doctors that I have ever met.  The first time she spoke to me on call,before even consultation and gave me handsome 15mins to calm me down. At my first visit she spoke to me for 1 hour and took down entire history of my problem. She asked even for the tiniest details which even I couldn't remember. She understood my problem well and explained everything to me well. She explained me what was my problem, what could be the plausible cause, what will be the line off treatment and how long the treatment will have to continue. I was diagnosed with urethera stenosis which she establsihed with cystoscopy. This was fixed by urinary cathetrization for 15 days followed by bladder instillations , physiotherapies and diet modifications. My treatment went for about 3 months and all the while she remained very supportive. Even when I broke down in the intial 15 days (which were most difficult part of the treatment), she supported me on call late night also.She builds faith with the patient and is always available for whatever help may be needed. Today after 3months of treatment with her, I am a much better person with no urinary problems at all.  I recommend Dr. Karishma to all those women who keep on having repeated and unexplained urinary problems. ",

One of my friend recommended Dr Karishma. I met her in July 2019 for the first time. She listened to my problems patiently & then she explained me about my problem in detail & also the line of treatment. She convinced me in such a manner that it was very easy for me to take decision about hysterectomy. Hysterectomy at this was a nightmare for me but she explained each & every aspect in detail & in very general terms then I didn\u2019t take much time to decide. She is one doctor who takes all necessary steps to avoid any risk for example she not only helped me to improve my HB  & Iron levels but also treated my inflamed bladder by instillations. Not only in terms of treatment she is a great moral & emotional support. Just after a month I met Dr Karishma there was a sudden shock in my life as in the month of August my husband had to undergo brain surgery which was very critical, my life was shattered & I was not able to think or take care about my problem there Dr Karishma was a great emotional support & guided me & finally in the month of November Dr Karishma& Dr Hegde did my hysterectomy. Dr. Karishma helped me to recover fast with help of physiotherapy. She is a wonderful person & she came like an angle in my life as now I feel much healthy & better. My life is back on track. I strongly recommended Dr Karishma T if someone is facing this problem.",

I had gone from countless pediatricians to countless gynecologists and urologists explaining my symptoms, to no end. I used to have a burning sensation on peeing every time and sometimes it would get so bad that I would bleed from my urethra. I would be inside an emergency room howling with pain every 3 months. I would explain my symptoms endlessly to the on-call doctors the follow-up Gynecologist or the urologist in the OPD the next day, just to be told that my symptoms were not that severe and I must have had early period spotting. I was always handed a pack of antibiotics for Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) and pain medication and sent on my way. I had really lost my faith in medical science for women to the point I would go to the emergency room and never go for the follow-up OPD as I knew exactly what I would be prescribed - an overly strong anti-biotic and pain meds followed by \"drink cranberry juice or have cranberry supplements\". I discovered so much medication for myself on my own by reading on the internet and started experimenting and trying to increase my pain threshold. Until one day I came across Dr. Karishma's profile and I decided to get on a video consultation with her. She did not dismiss my pain. She did not dismiss my claim to have blood in my urine or coming from my urethra. She was the first doctor to believe me and she told me that I maybe don't have UTI in the first place and maybe this is a bigger problem. she called me in for a physical examination and for the first time it was informed to me to get to the root of my problem I diagnostic procedure called cystoscopy will have to be performed. I underwent the cystoscopy which she herself performed on me. she took care of me after the procedure to ensure I was not in any kind of pain. And after that, she gave me the diagnosis that I had been searching for my entire life - interstitial cystitis. It is a chronic disease of the bladder which causes UTI-like symptoms but is not UTI. She started my treatment course. And ever since I walked into her office, I have not had to see the insides of an emergency room again. it has been 11 months. She has helped me greatly with my condition. I do not have to live in fear of peeing anymore. I can finally pee pain-free all thanks to her. and my bladder has not bled once since I met her.  She is a brilliant urogynecologist, the smartest doctor I have met in my life, and the friendliest and most caring person. She will move her schedule around her patients' needs. She will listen patiently and without any judgment. She even helped me with my extremely painful period cramps due to PCOS, which would render me bed-ridden for many days. She has been the best thing to happen to me. ",

Symptoms were a very slow stream, frequent use of toilet (every hour) and frequent cases of UTI. After spending 2 years with top urologists in the US, my problem did not resolve. I was told this would stay for lifetime and the only way was to do self catheterization.\n\nI reached out to Dr. Karishma via Practo for an opinion. I liked her approach very much that I decided to visit Delhi for treatment. She was very systematic in diagnosing the problem. She explained to me all possible causes of high urinary retention and started ruling out reasons one at a time, by running the necessary tests like Uroflowmetry, Urodynamics, MCU. She was super patient in answering my many questions. Her explanations were logical and she made it easy to understand and follow along why certain tests are needed and the treatment that would follow. The root cause was found to be a urethral stricture. This was unexpected for a person of young age like me especially given that I had no history of any surgery or childbirth. Dr. Karishma led the cystoscopy and surgery to remove the stricture. During my entire stay, she involved other doctors from her team as well to get a second opinion as needed. I did my visits at Sama Hospital, the staff at hospital was very cooperative and  supportive which made my visits very comfortable. \n\nDr. Karishma fixed my problem 100%. The flow of urine stream improved drastically!  \nInstead of going to the toilet 12-13 times a day, I went to the toilet 4-5 times a day like a person with a normal bladder. I never had to do self catheterization on a daily basis like what the doctors in the US had recommended. Since I don\u2019t have to use the toilet frequently, I am able to do day to day activities without having to worry about being around the toilet every hour whether it is at a restaurant, a place outside home, the office, the parks, etc. Getting treatment from Dr. Karishma has been a huge blessing for me. I am highly thankful and grateful to her for bringing my life back to normal.",

                "review_text": "I can't thank Dr. Karishma enough. So here goes my story. In July, 2020, I experienced burning sensation while passing urine. I consulted a doctor & was prescribed with antibiotics. I took two courses of antibiotics. The burning sensation left but the pain & tenderness never went away. Further, I consulted several doctors (including specialists) who diagnosed me with UTI (even though my urine reports were coming normal). I was prescribed with antibiotics, antifungals & cranberry syrup. However, I didn't find any relief. I kept asking doctors if I have Bladder Pain Syndrome but didn't get any satisfactory answer. With each passing day my misery & anxiety kept on increasing. Then one day I randomly searched for Urogynaecologists on Google & came across Dr. Karishma. I read the feedbacks on the Practo app & could relate with many patients who had similar problem like mine. In the first visit itself, Dr. Karishma told me what was going wrong with my body & explained everything very calmly to me & my parents. She did a cystoscopy to confirm my condition & I was diagnosed with Bladder Pain Syndrome / Interstitial Cystitis. Then she started my treatment which included strict diet, bladder instillations, pelvic floor physiotherapy (very important part) apart from oral medications. Two months down the treatment I would say I am in a much better condition. During each visit, Dr. Karishma fills me with so much positivity & she has always guided me very well. The best part about her is that she is extremely sincere & dedicated towards her work & she's very punctual. She has a very positive & friendly attitude towards her patients because of which I didn't hesitate in asking her any questions. If anyone has any bladder related issues, I would highly recommend them to consult Dr. Karishma who not only identified my problem but has also given me with solutions. Thank you Dr. Karishma. :) ",

First time we met with Dr. Karishma with no wait. She politely explained the problem in very detail so we could understand what's the problem is in general terms.\n\nShe treated us in the way that we became friends at first visit. She explained the course of treatment of fistula developed between bladder and uterus, which requires operation to repair fistula. She given us hope to us that this will get away without any problem.\n\nThe following night, after the surgery, Dr. Karishma was up whole night to see my messages, where she asked me to monitor and text her the urine output every hour. I was so relieved seeing her dedication and taking care of her patient.\n\nShe was very supportive throughout and before and after the treatment and very flexible in getting appointments with our ease. She cheered my wife always when she sees my wifes's tensed face.\n\nShe is very humble, caring and friendly doctor I have ever met. She is  very specialist in her field and provide best treatment which is best for the patient. We are so happy and luckiest that we consulted first with you Dr. Karishma.\n\nShe made over lives easier especially my wife's life. We are totally satisfied with her treatment. She has all the qualities that a Doctor should have.\n\nAgain, Thanks a lot and blessed always with smiles. We will miss her cute smile :-)",

After numerous short term treatments with various urologists and gynaechologists, one doctor reffered me to Dr. karishma, who is uro gynaechologist.  Before this I was not even aware that there is uro gynaechology also. She is one of the most patient doctors that I have ever met.  The first time she spoke to me on call,before even consultation and gave me handsome 15mins to calm me down. At my first visit she spoke to me for 1 hour and took down entire history of my problem. She asked even for the tiniest details which even I couldn't remember. She understood my problem well and explained everything to me well. She explained me what was my problem, what could be the plausible cause, what will be the line off treatment and how long the treatment will have to continue. I was diagnosed with urethera stenosis which she establsihed with cystoscopy. This was fixed by urinary cathetrization for 15 days followed by bladder instillations , physiotherapies and diet modifications. My treatment went for about 3 months and all the while she remained very supportive. Even when I broke down in the intial 15 days (which were most difficult part of the treatment), she supported me on call late night also.She builds faith with the patient and is always available for whatever help may be needed. Today after 3months of treatment with her, I am a much better person with no urinary problems at all.  I recommend Dr. Karishma to all those women who keep on having repeated and unexplained urinary problems. ",

One of my friend recommended Dr Karishma. I met her in July 2019 for the first time. She listened to my problems patiently & then she explained me about my problem in detail & also the line of treatment. She convinced me in such a manner that it was very easy for me to take decision about hysterectomy. Hysterectomy at this was a nightmare for me but she explained each & every aspect in detail & in very general terms then I didn\u2019t take much time to decide. She is one doctor who takes all necessary steps to avoid any risk for example she not only helped me to improve my HB  & Iron levels but also treated my inflamed bladder by instillations. Not only in terms of treatment she is a great moral & emotional support. Just after a month I met Dr Karishma there was a sudden shock in my life as in the month of August my husband had to undergo brain surgery which was very critical, my life was shattered & I was not able to think or take care about my problem there Dr Karishma was a great emotional support & guided me & finally in the month of November Dr Karishma& Dr Hegde did my hysterectomy. Dr. Karishma helped me to recover fast with help of physiotherapy. She is a wonderful person & she came like an angle in my life as now I feel much healthy & better. My life is back on track. I strongly recommended Dr Karishma T if someone is facing this problem.",

I had 3 courses of antibiotics, but my UTI never went away. I used to find it difficult to pee. My Gynaecologist referred me to a urologist. Both doctors were not able to understand the problem and my misery and anxiety kept on increasing. They claimed that I don\u2019t have any problem and that I am unnecessary anxious. They started giving me anti anxiety medicines. \n\nAfter one month of suffering, I found Dr Karishma profile on Practo. I visited her and in my first visit she heard me patiently and empathised with me. She did a very detailed study of my case. She understood by problem and assured me that I need not worry and that she can cure me completely. She started with the treatment and I was much better within 1st week of her treatment. Within one month of treatment, she cured me completely. She had been an angel for me. I really thank her from the bottom of my heart to help me and many patients like me. May god bless her.",

I had been suffering from the same since past 8 years and was incorrectly diagnosed of stricture of urethera. \n\nBy the time my treatment started with Dr. Karishna it was already delayed. It took long 6 months to bring the retention volume down and fight recurrent UTI. I started loosing hope but Dr. Karishma didn't. \n\nEvery time she saw me depressed, she cheered me up with the hope that I will win the battle. She not only supported me throughout with her treatment but also tried accomodating me between her appointments because it was difficult for me to take an off from work. \n\nI feel blessed to have found her, who not only treated me but also explained me in details what all precautions I need to take with my condition to manage the issue in best possible way. I admire her humane qualities. She treats every patient in a special way. Her warmth and care is exceptional. \n\nFor me she became an integral part of my life in last 7 months and now when I no longer need to visit Dr. Krishma very often, I miss her smiles and words of encouragement. \n\nHad it not been for her encouragement and strong belief in my recovery, I might have lost hope and discontinued my treatment midway. \n\nThank you Dr. Karishma, you truly are an angel and have helped so many patients like me. \n\nStay blessed always.

My was suffered a lot because of this issue. In june 2021 my niece suggested me to visit Dr. Karishma's clinic. I went to CUP, Sadiq Nagar to meet Dr. Karishma. In the first meeting itself dr. told that her issues is not UTI but some problem in the urine bladder. Dr. started treatment for the same. Dr performed cystoscopy on june 2021 and found the real cause the problem. The treatment went for almost 6 months. Dr suggested proper diet too. Now my wife is not having any issue. Dr Karishma is very helpful, punctual and friendly. Patients can call her any time. She taught so many things to my wife. Because of Dr. Karishma my wife is living normal life now.          I am so  thankful to Dr Karishma. Thank you so much madam. Keep on providing best treatment.",

I had tons of antibiotics through all these years degrading my overall experience uski tu of life and health. I was panicking all the time and as suggested by the doctors, stopped travelling, panicked at the thought of using public washrooms, started thinking of sexual activity as one of the causes and avoided physical closeness altogether. It was Dr. Karishma who diagnosed the problem, had a detailed first session of almost more than an hour where she patiently listened to everything and gave me hopes of recovery after explaining in detail what her diagnosis was and what the treatment would entail. She was God sent and turned my life around. \n\nI followed the diet modifications and medication she gave me, bladder instillations as suggested and then cystoscopy. No complications at all.  After almost 8-9 years of my life I had an entire year without any episodes of pain or burning or any other symptom and I cannot thank her enough for this.\n\nI am still seeing her for follow up treatments and just sitting down and talking to her in itself is a healing process.",

I will still struggling with chronic and embarrassing urinary symptoms for which the doctors could not find any explanation. I had already been through 4 cystoscopies, cystograms and several invasive tests. My confidence was zero and I had no life.  I broke down when I started telling Dr Karishma my symptoms.   This was my starting point with her. She started by first assuring me that all issues were curable and she was there to help me. She did a detailed study of my history, went through each and every report for the past 15 years and understood my issues in depth. She systematically went through all my health problems and started addressing them one by one.  I started visiting her every week for physiotherapy and taking the medication and following her advice to the T.  She assured me that there was nothing majorly wrong which also helped me to cope. With every passing week, I started feeling better, in fact there was a huge improvement in the first week itself.  Most of all, she treated me with so much dignity and respect that I had never got from any other doctor. I am much better now, in fact I feel I have got my life back. She has also been very satisfied with my progress. I highly recommend Dr Karishma for any urogynocological issues and I cannot thank her enough. ",

The doctors from Meerut kept doing the treatment but, unfortunately, I didn't feel so better as I should  have been.  I went to the Ayurvedic Treatment also for some months but that just didn't work. My condition was almost same. Actually, to be honest I was not getting my problem even the doctors I think were not getting what the problem was? I was sad really. The reports used to be normal. ***** * **** ** *** ***** ******** ******* ** **** *** ******* ****** * *** **** ******* ****** ********** **** *** ***** * ****** **** *** ******** I was sad because I had wasted many years in getting the treatments done. Finally, when even DR. Subhash Yadav ******** ****** ** ******* ** gave the address of DR. KARISHMA THARIANI in the end of September 2019. As soon as he gave me the address I got fixed an appointment. Then, I met DR. Karishma Thariani. She gave me a lot of time and also she could understand my problem. Although, it was the very first day i met she treated me ***** I was so satisfied indeed feeling happy.\nMoreover, she just told me everything about the way of the treatment would be done. For me the best thing was she is a lady doctor. I could have shared my problems with her well without feeling hesitated. She usually behaves very well with every patient. \nJust as my treatment began I started feeling better slowly slowly. As compared to the past treatments I was feeling far better. Now, to be very Frank I'm feeling so nice as my treatment was done well. I used to be upset in recent years but now all sadness is gone and I'm better. Furthermore, I feel so good to meet her. She always understands my problem that is why. \nNow, I don't have any tension regarding my problem because DR. Karishma Thariani is there to get me out of any matter of concern related to my disease. \n\nI would recommend to every patient( suffering from the same ) to meet DR. Karishma Mam.\n\nThank you a lot DR. Karishma Mam\nThank you so much. \n\n\n \n\n",

I went to so many doctors for my UTI but I never got a valid explanation of why my urine culture always came back negative after I had been diagnosed with a UTI.  She instead told why I was feeling the symptoms I was feeling. Even when I visited her in person, she was extremely calm and polite with me and made the whole experience extremely relaxing. She was able to assess my concern quickly which prevented me from making multiple trips. Her staff is tremendously helpful and very quick to send reports and respond online.",

She is indeed very empathetic and supportive towards her patients. I am happy to say that my long term problem was solved by the treatment she prescribed.",

The fact that she gives you an extremely patient hearing speaks volumes about her personality and comforts the patient even before the actual treatment starts. Extremely thorough in her field and totally abreast with the various ailments, visiting her has so far been a life changing experience for me. One amongst a handful of Urogynaecologists in the country, I sincerely fall short of words expressing her caliber and my gratitude & contentment.",

She has a very strong expertise in her field of urogynecology with a holistic approach, but most of all she\u2019s empathetic, helped me make sense of my diagnosis, took her time going through my treatment plan with me, helped me take DNA tests at my request, treated me for months, was available to take my calls when my pain got unbearable, always encouraged me that I would get back to normal even when I thought I wouldn\u2019t. I had visited other doctors before I found her, but She was the only doctor I could find in Delhi NCR, who truly understood the mental and physical toll it had on patients and treats patients with empathy, compassion and provides mental support which truly helped considering how difficult it is to diagnose and treat such conditions. Now that I\u2019m better I have Dr. Karishma and her team Nurse Kavitha, assistant Jyoti to thank for the excellent treatment and care they continue to provide me. ",

I have never met any doctor as humble and down to earth as Dr Karishma. \nMy mother was suffering from urine incontinence and it got so bad that she had almost lost hope that she will be able to live normal life again. \nAfter consulting a lot of gynaecologists and urologists, we got to meet Dr Karishma who works with Dr Aparna Hegde, Sama Hospital, Delhi.\nFrom the day 1, she has been really sweet to my parents. My parents being the senior citizens, more than anything else, they want to feel comfortable when they approach any doctor. \nDr Karishma made sure they felt comfortable, she used to answer all my mother's queries patiently. Through out the process, she made my mother feel at home and not worry too much. \nDr Karishma and Dr Aparna is a lethal combination, it is a wonderful team and they try their best to make sure the patient's problem is correctly diagnosed and cured.\nI remember post surgery, Dr Karishma made it a point to come and meet my mother time to time. There were moments when my mother was not so easy to manage (due to post surgery pain etc) but Dr Karishma was so calm and composed through out. She is a commendable doctor, master in her subject and a great human being. My mother's incontinence problem is completely cured, thanks to you Dr Karishma. For my mother, you are no less than a daughter. Thank you so much, we are obliged!!",

My mental health was also affected because of this condition. Then I visited Dr. Karishma ma'am in June 2022. She listened my problem and for proper diagnosis she did a cystoscopy to confirm my condition. I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis. Then she started my treatment which include bladder installation, physiotherapy ( pelvic floor) , diet and oral medication. After taking treatment my condition started getting better. At present I am in good condition. My life is back on track. Dr. Karishma ma'am is very humble, cooperative and caring person. If anyone has bladder related issue I would highly recommend them to consult Dr. Karishma.\nThank you ma'am.\n",

Her sincerity and dedication to her profession and the patients under her care are truly exemplary.\nI have no hesitation at all in recommending Dr. Karishma Thariani to anyone looking for the right doctor for the  treatment of urogynae problems.",

In our very first visit Dr Karishma spent considerable amount of time to understand the issue. She was very patient while listing to my mother.  She requested for few tests and in our very next visit the Dr was able to identify the root cause and suggested the process she will follow to treat my mother. \nShe performed two small procedures and after 5 months, my mother is very happy with the treatment and she is now living free from her frequent infection. \n\nOne thing which i really liked about the doctor is her patience and how she listen to the patient and the care giver\n\nI strongly recommend Dr Karishma ",
