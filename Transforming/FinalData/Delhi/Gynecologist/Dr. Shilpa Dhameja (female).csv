"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"We have known Dr Shilpa for almost 2 years now as she was our consulting Doctor and I am glad we met her. She has been extremely supportive from the very beginning and kept guiding us at every step. We never really felt the need to consult any other Doctor for our pre and Post Pregnancy period and she was always there whenever we needed. Below are some of the highlights that I believe really helped:

1. Extremely empathetic and she talked more like a friend.
2. Always available when needed. Be it call or whatsapp, she would always get back.
3. Preparing and guiding us in our pre/post Pregnancy period and explaining everything in detail.
4. Providing us our full time whenever we visited and we never once felt that she was in a hurry. She always listened and would proactively reach out when needed.
5. Most important, she gave us the mental support from time to time that we really needed and you don’t really expect that from doctors, atleast this was a first such experience for us.
6. Also considered the financial aspect that a lot of Doctors miss out on. She would always give suggestions and provide free consultations from time to time.

Overall We consider ourselves lucky to have met her and going through the most important phase of our life with Doctor Shilpa on our side. She finally helped us become proud parents on July 16 and kept following up with NICU doctors on our behalf, even when it was not her duty!!

I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for help or consultation and I can give you my personal guarantee that you are not going to regret it!!

She had always given us enough time for all the queries, with each appointment being comfortable and personalised. Few recommendations really stand out in overall interactions - a) She avoided unnecessary allopathy and instead recommended iron rich diet to boost my hemoglobine levels. b) She advises minimum tests and scans.
Dr Shilpa was always available 24*7 for all doubts and queries even the trivial one’s. The most trustworthy part is the ample medical knowledge and positive vibes she carries, which gave me complete strength and trust during my high risk delivery.
I highly recommend the doctor. Thank you for your consistent support throughout 👍
