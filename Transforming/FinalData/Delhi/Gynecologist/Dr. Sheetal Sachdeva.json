Me and my husband were not sure of carrying this pregnancy ahead but she supported us, understood all our concerns and gave us a right suggestion very gently . She helped me to have my little newborn princecharming in my arms who is my life .As a doctor she always knew what has to be done rightly and as a lady she knew how to give solutions to a pregnant lady who has her own dilemmas. If you need a perfect guidance, she is the best person to approach and a doctor who is always ready to help you beyond your expectations . In my case she helped me in turning my dream come true. A big thanks to her but this would be very small gesture to express my gratitude for her. I want to thank you from the core of my heart for being extremely supportive during these difficult times. I would like to tell you that you were so calm, sweet, loving and caring. These qualities made me believe in you everyday and I could trust you blindly. You were the one who understood me in a better way. Infact you stood as a backbone during my tough time of pregnancy. Thank you for everything what you did for me! You motivated and encouraged me everyday. This helped me to overcome my fears easily. There are bundle of memories which i will relish forever. And yes last but not the least without my husband's support the incredible journey of meeting you would not have been completed. I don't know what glimpse did he get from you but ya he was for sure that you are the only right person whom we can go ahead with. Thanks alot my dear Sheetal ma'am for making my journey expectionally great. Luv u and will keep miss you throughout my life. God bless you always. I will always count on you ma\u2019am.\nRegards\nKunal & Pooja",

Not even once i could find anything that is mentioned by people in their stories. She gets easily offended by questions. There is no personal touch by the way. She never seem bothered by my anxiety. Every body and every pregnancy is different. She literally scolded me and my husband on call when I was in labour and pressurized us to take a decision in few minutes. At that moment in hospital during labour I felt how unlucky I am to have a doctor so rude. I was traumatized after my cesarean \nnow after 2 months i have got enough stability to think about what happened to me.\nWhile Reading other stories i felt..did i pay less or what? I don't know where was her friendliness and approachable nature in my case. She never explained me the procedure i might go through so that i can take an informed decision. Upon asking she scolded \"make a decision first\"\nOn my latest appointment where i asked her whether i can clean my pubic hair above the stitches. She said yes. I confirmed whether i can use hair removal creams...she got irritated and said...i am not going to discuss this now..i said you can remove so do whatever you like.\nI think during my journey i kept on hoping that may be she is good based on practo stories and i should keep patience...today i regret that. I shouldn't have waited.\nI wish i had a doctor who understands that for a doctor, delivering a baby is an every day task..but for a patient...it's life changing.",

Me and my husband were not sure of carrying this pregnancy ahead but she supported us, understood all our concerns and gave us a right suggestion very gently . She helped me to have my little newborn princecharming in my arms who is my life .As a doctor she always knew what has to be done rightly and as a lady she knew how to give solutions to a pregnant lady who has her own dilemmas. If you need a perfect guidance, she is the best person to approach and a doctor who is always ready to help you beyond your expectations . In my case she helped me in turning my dream come true. A big thanks to her but this would be very small gesture to express my gratitude for her. I want to thank you from the core of my heart for being extremely supportive during these difficult times. I would like to tell you that you were so calm, sweet, loving and caring. These qualities made me believe in you everyday and I could trust you blindly. You were the one who understood me in a better way. Infact you stood as a backbone during my tough time of pregnancy. Thank you for everything what you did for me! You motivated and encouraged me everyday. This helped me to overcome my fears easily. There are bundle of memories which i will relish forever. And yes last but not the least without my husband's support the incredible journey of meeting you would not have been completed. I don't know what glimpse did he get from you but ya he was for sure that you are the only right person whom we can go ahead with. Thanks alot my dear Sheetal ma'am for making my journey expectionally great. Luv u and will keep miss you throughout my life. God bless you always. I will always count on you ma\u2019am.\nRegards\nKunal & Pooja",

Not even once i could find anything that is mentioned by people in their stories. She gets easily offended by questions. There is no personal touch by the way. She never seem bothered by my anxiety. Every body and every pregnancy is different. She literally scolded me and my husband on call when I was in labour and pressurized us to take a decision in few minutes. At that moment in hospital during labour I felt how unlucky I am to have a doctor so rude. I was traumatized after my cesarean \nnow after 2 months i have got enough stability to think about what happened to me.\nWhile Reading other stories i felt..did i pay less or what? I don't know where was her friendliness and approachable nature in my case. She never explained me the procedure i might go through so that i can take an informed decision. Upon asking she scolded \"make a decision first\"\nOn my latest appointment where i asked her whether i can clean my pubic hair above the stitches. She said yes. I confirmed whether i can use hair removal creams...she got irritated and said...i am not going to discuss this now..i said you can remove so do whatever you like.\nI think during my journey i kept on hoping that may be she is good based on practo stories and i should keep patience...today i regret that. I shouldn't have waited.\nI wish i had a doctor who understands that for a doctor, delivering a baby is an every day task..but for a patient...it's life changing.",

She explains everything in detail and very patiently listens to your detailed issues and apprehensions. She ensures her patients are directed towards the right course of action and also ensures she returns to queries outside the consultation time. \nA lot of patients\u2019 anxieties are alleviated if they get the belief that they\u2019re being treated by the right person- thanks to Dr Sheetal for playing that role.",
