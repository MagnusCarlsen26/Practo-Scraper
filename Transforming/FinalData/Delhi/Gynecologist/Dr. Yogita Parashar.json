So humble n calm and always filled with positivity. \nThat's what you need when you're expecting your first child and already have so many things going on in your head..you need a guide like Dr Yogita..to guide you well and support you throughout the beautiful experience called pregnancy!\nDr Yogita has delivered my sister's baby in the past so in my case she had to be the first choice. \nAnd I'm glad she was my doctor. \nEverything was going fab until I got to know that I have gestational sugar. I already shifted to Gurgaon so I went to nearby doctor. I don't want to demean and disrespect anyone but she was a horrible doctor. She scared me so much that I had tears in my eyes. \nI was already 8 months pregnant then. \nI was so tensed that I immediately went to Dr Yogita again. And thank god for her. She calmed me down..gave me the right knowledge and guidance..\nAnd after seeing her I delivered my baby boy in 37th week..through the normal process. \nIf it wasn't for dr Yogita I wouldn't have the courage to deliver my son normally. In this era of medical line being called a money making business there are doctors like Dr Yogita who make all the difference n respect their profession. \nCan never forget the amazing woman who gave me the biggest joy of my life ! \n",

After a series of tests and treatments by her, we were able to conceive. However, our pregnancy journey was not very smooth and we faced issues like GDM, High BP, Low lying placenta, etc. but Dr. Yogita made us sail through all those rough patches smoothly. While I was in my 8th month, my BP suddenly shot to alarming levels and to our surprise, Dr. Yogita Parashar, responded on phone even in the wee hours of morning and advised us to get admitted immediately. This turned out to be the best advice at that time as in the hospital, my water broke unexpectedly and I started bleeding profusely. I had to undergo an emergency c-section and Dr. Yogita Parashar rushed to the hospital at 12 midnight on just a call. Thanks to her, today we are the happy parents of a baby boy. Had it not been for her, we even dread to think of what could have happened that night. Today we can say without an iota of doubt that Dr. Yogita is one of the best gynaecologists in Dwarka who is also a friend to the patients. It may also be added here that during lockdown, when quite a few doctors refused to see their patients, Dr. Yogita  provided consultation regularly, which was a big help for people like me who had a complicated pregnancy journey. We are really indebted to her and we highly recommend her especially for high risk pregnancies and infertility cases. Thank u so much Dr. Yogita ....",

I always seen Indian doctors as a ru-de, gre-edy, over the head and I know all type of people. But she restored the faith back to me and my wife by showing how good and helpful a doctor can be. She always stood by us when we were in a very long and demoralising journey towards parenthood. When we had infertility and ovulation issues for a long period.. she was there to help us and it was just because of her that we did not give up. When we had to go through reduction from twins to single, she was the only light in that scared and a very emotional period. We actually thought that we had lost our baby but she made us feel as if it is just a normal procedure and as if it is a better thing for us. As my wife is a bit weak and had morning sickness in all the three trimesters (unlike others who usually face the issue in first trimester only), I doubted of a normal baby. But we are now a proud parent of a healthy baby boy. How many doctor suggest where to eat Chhole Bhatore in your trimesters periods when your wife refuse to eat anything else. And how many doctors insists on normal delivery even when you ask for surgerical delivery. And how many doctors you can call  anytime believing she will respond even at 12 midnight. That's how good she is. We went to her with our problems and she not only resolved it but made us also earn a friend. Thanks doc.. thanks so much.. God bless you and your family.",

We did not wanted C-section and worked pretty hard. In her second trimester  she was weighing 85kg and we controlled the diet as in 3-6th month for a PCOD the chances of miscarriage are three time so my wife could not excerise, she was on vegital juices and followed strictly the diet plan of vegitables and fruits which helped her reduced her weight to 79 kg. After 6 months there are no chances to reduce further. And galdly we come across Dr Yogita Prashar - *** ******** She assured us that the case is not at High Risk and  there is nothing to worry. After meeting her we had a sign of relief and with every meeting our confidence on high kept on increasing as she was so humble, soft spoken and very amicable. She suggested few excerise in 9 month and my delivered a pretty healthy baby of 3.1 kg and too via a normal delivery. ** ******** ** ****** * ******** And we see this now as miracle.

Luckily Dr Yogita Parashar was available in OPD.  On very first day I decided that I will not go anywhere else. My decision was right. I gave birth to my baby, weighing 3.12 kg, normal delivery.  I strongly recommend Dr Yogita Parashar on the basis of my personal experience. \n\u2022\tShe supervised all 9 months of pregnancy, no problem crept in. she assured me of normal delivery. \n\u2022\tKeeping in view my height (5\u20192\u201d) a Baby weighing 2.8 kg would have been ideal. Weight of my baby was 3.12 kg during birth. My doctor had to sweat a lot but she kept her word. As per the trend, had there been some other Doctor she might have gone for operation.  \n\u2022\tDr Yogita is a very soft spoken and cheerful doctor, smiling all the time. She is a patient listener and handles patient carefully with very nice attitude.   \n\u2022\tSince this was first pregnancy, I had no previous experience of any gynecologist but I tell you that Dr Yogita is not only a good doctor but a good human being as well. She is committed to what she says. \n\u2022\tI see crowd increasing day by day on her OPD at Rockland. This approves of professional efficiency. \n",

I already shifted to Gurgaon so I went to nearby doctor. I don't want to demean and disrespect anyone but she was a horrible doctor. She scared me so much that I had tears in my eyes. \nI was already 8 months pregnant then. \nI was so tensed that I immediately went to Dr Yogita again. And thank god for her. She calmed me down..gave me the right knowledge and guidance..\nAnd after seeing her I delivered my baby boy in 37th week..through the normal process. \nIf it wasn't for dr Yogita I wouldn't have the courage to deliver my son normally.

After a series of tests and treatments by her, we were able to conceive. However, our pregnancy journey was not very smooth and we faced issues like GDM, High BP, Low lying placenta, etc. but Dr. Yogita made us sail through all those rough patches smoothly. While I was in my 8th month, my BP suddenly shot to alarming levels and to our surprise, Dr. Yogita Parashar, responded on phone even in the wee hours of morning and advised us to get admitted immediately. This turned out to be the best advice at that time as in the hospital, my water broke unexpectedly and I started bleeding profusely. I had to undergo an emergency c-section and Dr. Yogita Parashar rushed to the hospital at 12 midnight on just a call. Thanks to her, today we are the happy parents of a baby boy. Had it not been for her, we even dread to think of what could have happened that night. Today we can say without an iota of doubt that Dr. Yogita is one of the best gynaecologists in Dwarka who is also a friend to the patients. It may also be added here that during lockdown, when quite a few doctors refused to see their patients, Dr. Yogita  provided consultation regularly, which was a big help for people like me who had a complicated pregnancy journey. We are really indebted to her and we highly recommend her especially for high risk pregnancies and infertility cases. Thank u so much Dr. Yogita ....",

I always seen Indian doctors as a ru-de, gre-edy, over the head and I know all type of people. But she restored the faith back to me and my wife by showing how good and helpful a doctor can be. She always stood by us when we were in a very long and demoralising journey towards parenthood. When we had infertility and ovulation issues for a long period.. she was there to help us and it was just because of her that we did not give up. When we had to go through reduction from twins to single, she was the only light in that scared and a very emotional period. We actually thought that we had lost our baby but she made us feel as if it is just a normal procedure and as if it is a better thing for us. As my wife is a bit weak and had morning sickness in all the three trimesters (unlike others who usually face the issue in first trimester only), I doubted of a normal baby. But we are now a proud parent of a healthy baby boy. How many doctor suggest where to eat Chhole Bhatore in your trimesters periods when your wife refuse to eat anything else. And how many doctors insists on normal delivery even when you ask for surgerical delivery. And how many doctors you can call  anytime believing she will respond even at 12 midnight. That's how good she is. We went to her with our problems and she not only resolved it but made us also earn a friend. Thanks doc.. thanks so much.. God bless you and your family.",

We did not wanted C-section and worked pretty hard. In her second trimester  she was weighing 85kg and we controlled the diet as in 3-6th month for a PCOD the chances of miscarriage are three time so my wife could not excerise, she was on vegital juices and followed strictly the diet plan of vegitables and fruits which helped her reduced her weight to 79 kg. After 6 months there are no chances to reduce further. And galdly we come across Dr Yogita Prashar - *** ******** She assured us that the case is not at High Risk and  there is nothing to worry. After meeting her we had a sign of relief and with every meeting our confidence on high kept on increasing as she was so humble, soft spoken and very amicable. She suggested few excerise in 9 month and my delivered a pretty healthy baby of 3.1 kg and too via a normal delivery. ** ******** ** ****** * ******** And we see this now as miracle.

Luckily Dr Yogita Parashar was available in OPD.  On very first day I decided that I will not go anywhere else. My decision was right. I gave birth to my baby, weighing 3.12 kg, normal delivery.  I strongly recommend Dr Yogita Parashar on the basis of my personal experience. \n\u2022\tShe supervised all 9 months of pregnancy, no problem crept in. she assured me of normal delivery. \n\u2022\tKeeping in view my height (5\u20192\u201d) a Baby weighing 2.8 kg would have been ideal. Weight of my baby was 3.12 kg during birth. My doctor had to sweat a lot but she kept her word. As per the trend, had there been some other Doctor she might have gone for operation.  \n\u2022\tDr Yogita is a very soft spoken and cheerful doctor, smiling all the time. She is a patient listener and handles patient carefully with very nice attitude.   \n\u2022\tSince this was first pregnancy, I had no previous experience of any gynecologist but I tell you that Dr Yogita is not only a good doctor but a good human being as well. She is committed to what she says. \n\u2022\tI see crowd increasing day by day on her OPD at Rockland. This approves of professional efficiency. \n",

From day 1 she has been encouraging me for normal delivery.  She is soft spoken.  She answers all your queries with patience and give time to all her patients. She doesn't ask to have unnecessary tests. \n I insisted her to operate when I was not able to take the labour pain. But still she refused and we delivered baby girl through normal delivery on 7th Aug 2018. Thanks Dr. Yogita.  **** ***** ** ******  Will surely recommend her .

She has a very cool temperament, listen to us carefully and explains the factual situations with all prose and cons. In present world of money making, she is one of the few doctors who motivates and insist for normal delivery rather than cesarean.\nWhy I am telling this much is, because delivering the 2nd baby normally after the 1st baby through cesarean is not less than a miracle to me. \nNow finally after 3 months after delivering normally, I am feeling very good and at the top of the heaven. This is all because of Yogita mam, I once again thank her a lot for her help, encouragment and terrible effort and dedication during delivery.",
