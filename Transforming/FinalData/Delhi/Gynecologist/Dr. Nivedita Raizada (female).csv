"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"We consulted Dr. Nivedita throughout the pregnancy period and had been under her advice till the successful delivery of our baby boy in mid-April 2021. She is beyond exceptional in several ways and would highly recommend her to everyone. 

Her knowledge, experience and overall excellency at work, was quite apparent from our very first visit to the clinic, and we developed complete trust in her from then on - I remember telling my husband on our way back from our first visit, that with her, I feel fully assured that everything will be taken care of and I can completely rely on her. 

On our monthly visits to her through the pregnancy, she always gave us ample time to explain everything in detail and answer all our questions. It was simply amazing how without us having to say much, she was perceptive of our preferences and needs and always seamlessly factored those in her advice to us. Also, it was extremely heartening and almost unbelievable to see that, despite running on such tight schedule and meeting several patients in a day, she remembered the tiniest details about us from our earlier visits, including even the most mundane things like my plans of visiting parents or where they stay - these small things made it apparent how much she cared personally, something that‚Äôs so very precious and rare to find in these times. 

Dr. Nivedita‚Äôs approach of advising on holistic wellness, including all-natural methods such as stressing on walking, exercises, improving dietary intake and closely monitoring weight gain really helped us in eventually being able to have a normal delivery. On the date of delivery, we reached out to her quite early in the morning and she immediately guided us on next steps and personally ensured the coordination with hospital for an extremely smooth admission, despite the additional formalities required due to covid. Dr. Nivedita arrived well in time and stayed with us throughout the long labour. She kept encouraging and guiding me with expertise all along. It was only her presence and calming voice, that helped me bear the killing labour pains - it simply wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without her!

And so, especially in this most important event of our lives, my husband and I feel extremely blessed to have come to know of her and to have been under her guidance. 

If you are looking for a highly experienced gynaecologist who will care and be concerned for you just as family ‚Äì she is the one to go to!

This was our first pregnancy so we were quite nervous before meeting her. she guided us so well, and explained everything at our first appointment. She was very careful since we had our first appointment and would never delay to call/ WhatsApp to answer back also updates you if you have an appointment and she is getting late. She is very much committed and honest to her profession. She is very patient, soft spoken and full of humanity. She is also having friendly nature which makes you comforatable.
She practiced in *** **** ********* ** *****(Fortis Hopital, Rainbow Children Hospital, Sitaram Bhartia Institute of Science and Research) and she has great experience of normal delivery. She encourages and prepares her patients for a normal delivery.

She helped us in making a activity and diet plan of having a healthy and happy baby. She told us to be happy, active, stick with healthy diet, avoid outside food and go for long walks daily, also encourage us to go for vacation after 3 months of pregnancy for a change. We never faced any complications during our pregnancy under the guidance of Nivedita Ma'am and delivered a happy, healthy and a cute baby boy:-) @ Rainbow Hospital Malviya Nagar on 12th May 2020. My wife asked for Caesarean Section in the labour room as she was unable to bear the pain, but Nivedita Ma'am asked me to motivate her for normal delivery, when we finally decided for Caesarean Section, Nivedita Ma'am still told me that she will try once again for normal delivery in operation theater. So you can understand how much efforts she puts for normal delivery. She made our entire pregnancy journey a very delightful and memorable experience for us. We highly recommened Dr. Nivedita Ma'am.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Nivedita has been a greatest support entire my pregnancy. What a lovely lady and a talented doctor. Heard about her from one of my relative, and I contacted her as soon as I got to know about my pregnancy. 
Since my first visit she encouraged for normal delivery. Honestly I never thought about having a normal delivery as I considered it an impossible task. But she made it sound possible.
My entire pregnancy journey turned out utterly beautiful and extremely smooth under her guidance. However, at the starting of my 36th week I started to have some issues and it looked like I might have to deliver prematurely. Still Dr Nivedita didnt give up and after the checkups, ultrasound, tests she assured my that we can wait. Almost every day she texted me about my health and baby movement. Personally I dont think any doctor would do that, but she is more than just a doctor I believe.
Till my last phase she urged for exercise and walking, and I did that. In my 40th week when I experience my water breaking early at 4 am, i immediately called her and as usual she was too quick to respond. She asked me to reach the hospital and she made all the arrangements for me over the call at the hospital. 
At 6.30 she induced, contractions started and the pain was unbearable. I req her to give me a pain killer but she motivated me to bear the pain as having a pain killer could increase the labour duration. 
I was in labour for 4 hours and exactly at 10.20 in the morning I delivered a healthy boy. 
I still cant believe that a person like me had a normal delivery, that too i delivered in just 4 hours, which is next to impossible. 
This is what dr. nivedita is, making imposible possible.
Her support has been a blessing truly. It has been 21 days since I delivered and I feel blissful as I did not have stitches on my tummy. I am just so thankful to her. Had it been any other doctor, I would have faced a c section for sure. 
During my labour she constantly motivated me to breathe deep and be calm. 
Dr nivedita's patience for normal delivery, experience and her talent is what blows our mind. Her polite nature and soft spoken personality is an add on. Whenever I had a query I would drop a msg to her and she quickly used to reply my messages.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Me and my husband consulted Dr Nivedita Raizada for my pregnancy check up in June 2020. Due to covid, initial appointments were telephonic. However, Dr Raizada gave complete time in each telephonic conversation and addressed all our concerns. Since beginning she stressed on normal delivery and counseled me really well for the same. She prescribed me healthy diet to follow for appropriate weight gain and exercises that could increase the chances of having normal delivery. Eventually I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl through normal delivery on January 28. The entire process of delivery was very well managed by Dr Raizada. She remained with us on phone constantly when pains were induced and informed us of treatment at each and every step. Since my water broke in the morning on Jan 28, there were chances of baby undergoing stress, yet Dr Raizada constantly monitored baby's condition and left on stone unturned to ensure normal delivery. We are glad that we met her for our pregnancy check up. Having delivery done by her was one of the best decisions that we took. She is an extremely calm and understanding medical professional who not only treats her patients well but also respects them, listens to them and address all of their queries. In her clinic, she gives adequate time during every visit. It is very rare to find such doctors these days who keep patients and their feelings central to the treatment process.

I have not seen a doctor before who is so much ethical and committed towards  her profession. She made this entire journey a very delightful experience for us. She had always answered even my silliest doubts. She is very patient and soft spoken. Will explain everything very nicely and in layman terms to her patients. Right from the beginning she was very careful and cautious and would never delay to call/ WhatsApp back to answer me ( you will  rarely find doctors doing this ) She helped me in setting  my proritiy  (of having a healthy and happy baby) over anything else. She told me to be active, happy and go for walks daily . That's why I never faced any complications in my pregnancy and ended up delivering a healthy and really a happy baby :). She has education and  experience from one of the premier institutes of India. The treatment is advanced and she will not put you on pills unless it is necessary. She would encourage and prepare her patients for a normal delivery . I have heard of many doctors suggesting ceasarian even under normal cases to earn money.   I was lucky to find her. Me and my husband are very grateful to her",2020-02-29 07:41:15,False,True,chhavi gautam,,,

Shared the concern with the doctor, all medications and advises given by her were extremely effective

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Maternal Fetal Medicine,Pregnancy Hypertension (Preeclampsia/ Eclampsia),",0,0,YES,"This was my third time of getting pregnant. My last two pregnancies have turned into miscarriage due to various reasons. This time around I got the news of my pregnancy during the lockdown, since no clinics were open nor were any OPD's working I decided to contact Dr.Nivedita whose clinic I saw in my apartment campus. I took her details from her husband Dr. Anurag Puri who we had visited for a consultation sometime ago. 

When I connected with Dr. Nivedita and shared with her my past 2 pregnancy experiences she immediately got into action and assured me that she understands how precious this pregnancy was and she will ensure the baby gets into my hands. 

The pregnancy progressed and my faith in Dr. Nivedita kept increasing with every interaction that I had with her. She kept our physical interactions minimum considering the covid times and also was prompt in answering all my whatsapp messages even if it were late evenings or early mornings. Talking to her always helped me keep my anxiety in place and helped me sail through my pregnancy without any family support.
As we proceeded, I developed pregnancy induced hypertension in my 8th month. Dr. Nivedita chalked out a plan where I was to monitor my BP multiple times a day and the same needed to be shared with her,this helped her take quick decisions on my medical condition by changing or altering medicines accordingly. As we were about to complete 36 weeks and enter 37 weeks I realised that my BP was going extremely out of control and I started sending updates to Dr. Every two hours, she personally coordinated my hospital visits for getting NST's done and was in touch with the Dr's at Fortis to ensure my reports were well understood and monitored. 
The evening of Diwali was extremely stressful as the BP was raising beyond the expected limits and I was constantly in touch with Dr. Nivedita who despite the festive fervour was on constant messages with me guiding me and assuring me. Finally she took the call of admitting me to the hospital the sane night and operating me next morning to avoid any further risk to me and the unborn child. I just told her one thing whatever happens please save my baby. 

And the next day of Diwali, she came to the hospital in the morning and I was soooo much reassured listening to her voice and seeing her. I was then taken to the OT and in a few minutes I heard my baby cry and through the operation she kept talking to me to keep me engaged. 

This was a surreal experience for me 8 years of marriage, 2 failed pregnancies and here I was living my dream of being a mother. All this could just happen because of Dr. Nivedita Raizada. 

They say Dr's are given the place of GOD, I truly truly truly believe in this now. If you have a dream of holding your child in your hands and you are looking for personalised care and attention, Dr. Nivedita is your go to person. 

Thank you Dr. Nivedita for helping me live and realise my dream. ",2020-11-24 15:26:42,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
