When we left without consulting, she called us and asked to meet at clinic. She then immediately asked to go for ecg test. And based on those reports, she asked to get admitted.\nMy wife got admitted in max, patparganj and there the horor started. We were informed that it might require a surgery for the delivery even when all was well. When we decided to leave hospital and get admitted to some other, she came back immediately and after discussion with us, she did some thing which started labor pain.\nMax is popular for doing surgery in 9/10 cases even when it is not needed.\nWe applied all that reference and threatened to leave hospital, it was a normal delivery.",

And based on those reports, she asked to get admitted.\nMy wife got admitted in max, patparganj and there the horor started. We were informed that it might require a surgery for the delivery even when all was well. When we decided to leave hospital and get admitted to some other, she came back immediately and after discussion with us, she did some thing which started labor pain.\nMax is popular for doing surgery in 9/10 cases even when it is not needed.\nWe applied all that reference and threatened to leave hospital, it was a normal delivery.",
