I tried my level best to follow her advice and it happened.  I delivered normally. She waited for things to happen for hours and kept me also motivated and positive.  There was one point where in I had given up but it was her motivation that kept me going. She is an angel and true to her profession.  A very dedicated and hard working person who tries her level best to reach out to her patients to help them.",

I don't think I would have had a normal delivery without her guidance, patience and support during labor- she kept my spirits high, didn't let me give up after 17hrs of labor (baby was born in the 19th) and explained the procedures to make me comfortable. Right from sound & timely advice, to educating me & my husband on next steps to also guiding us on legit yoga/lamaze workshops- she's been resourceful and of course kept standards high for exercise & fitness where I tended to slack :) It's rare to find a great combination of expertise and empathy in this field and she aces both. She is also open to feedback. I am glad I made the right choice and highly recommend her :)",

But in the first meeting, I was convinced and got confidence in her. That she would efficiently take control of the rest of my pregnancy journey. \nShe is very humble, soft spoken and answers all your queries. \nInitially she was preparing us for the normal delivery of my twins. But at my 36th week of pregnancy, the position of my babies was not convenient for normal delivery. I\nreally appreciate her decision to opt for a C-section at 36th week of pregnancy. I gave birth to a healthy Baby Boy and a Girl. \n\nDuring the C-section, I was totally conscious and witnessed the whole process. There was a shortage of other doctors during the operation due to other emergency cases.\nDespite being the HOD Doctor, Dr. Rinky Sengupta single handedly delivered my twin babies and did all the stitching herself. All this has induced immense respect for her and her caliber.\n\nDr. Rinku Sengupta is really God sent for me and my family. I am very lucky to have the right doctor at the right time.\n\nThank you Dr. Rinku Sengupta.",

My prolactin level was shooting up every 3-4 months. One of my friends recommended Dr. Rinku. She helped me get my cycle regular and I conceived naturally within 6 months.\nDuring my pregnancy journey, she guided me throughout and answered every question that I asked. She not only gave proper treatment and managed the pregnancy from the very beginning, but also she motivated me to remain positive during pregnancy. She also counselled me well to try for normal delivery instead of going for a caesarian. She prescribed only the required medicine and focused on a natural diet and exercise rather than supplements. \nI did not have labour pain even after 40 weeks of gestation. Dr. Rinku induced labour and I gave birth to my little angel through normal delivery at Rainbow Hospital on 9 Dec 2022. Her team was indeed very supportive and encouraging during the labour.\nI am really thankful to Dr. Rinku Sengupta for giving me the best gift and supporting me throughout the pregnancy journey.",

However she knows her work well. She is highly professional and delivery what she and hospital claims- \"Normal Delivery\".  If you dream of having normal delivery please see any gynecologist of this hospital. You will not feel that u r in India where urban families have accepted the truth that normal delivery is a past thing. Charges for hospitalization are kind of high but worth it. Not only doctors but their is staff is amazing. I delivered my bundle of joy 3 months back with the great team of doctors and Sister Rita George and Sister Anju.  I am thankful to Dr. Rinku for keeping my enthusiasm high for the normal delivery and I can't thank Sister Rita George and Sister Anju enough for being such a support during the active labor time. They were so fantastic at most difficult time.\nBest of luck and remember humans are supposed to deliver babies normally just like all other animals on this planet.",

She is a non-sense doctor, she doesn't scare you with unnecessary medications or tests. She has such a motherly vibe around her. The best part is she is always available on the phone if you have any health issues- fever, or allergies, and she instantly advises you.  I CAN'T THANK HER ENOUGH for helping me bring my baby girl into the world. She was AMAZING support during the labor when you are the weakest and you need a mental and emotional lift, she will be right beside you!!! ",

Since then, I made my mind that in my second pregnancy, by the grace of Almighty, I will surely go to Dr.Rinku Sen Gupta for VBAC. In my very first visit, she stressed upon exercises which specifically helps in promoting VBAC. Dr. Rinku was like an angel to me during my labor. I was amazed to see how much effort Dr. Rinku and her staff were putting in. I was blessed with a baby boy on September 2 2022, via VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Cesarean). I had a Ceasarean earlier.

I don't think I would have had a normal delivery without her guidance, patience and support during labor- she kept my spirits high, didn't let me give up after 17hrs of labor (baby was born in the 19th) and explained the procedures to make me comfortable. Right from sound & timely advice, to educating me & my husband on next steps to also guiding us on legit yoga/lamaze workshops- she's been resourceful and of course kept standards high for exercise & fitness where I tended to slack :) It's rare to find a great combination of expertise and empathy in this field and she aces both. She is also open to feedback. I am glad I made the right choice and highly recommend her :)",

But in the first meeting, I was convinced and got confidence in her. That she would efficiently take control of the rest of my pregnancy journey. \nShe is very humble, soft spoken and answers all your queries. \nInitially she was preparing us for the normal delivery of my twins. But at my 36th week of pregnancy, the position of my babies was not convenient for normal delivery. I\nreally appreciate her decision to opt for a C-section at 36th week of pregnancy. I gave birth to a healthy Baby Boy and a Girl. \n\nDuring the C-section, I was totally conscious and witnessed the whole process. There was a shortage of other doctors during the operation due to other emergency cases.\nDespite being the HOD Doctor, Dr. Rinky Sengupta single handedly delivered my twin babies and did all the stitching herself. All this has induced immense respect for her and her caliber.\n\nDr. Rinku Sengupta is really God sent for me and my family. I am very lucky to have the right doctor at the right time.\n\nThank you Dr. Rinku Sengupta.",

She helped me get my cycle regular and I conceived naturally within 6 months.\nDuring my pregnancy journey, she guided me throughout and answered every question that I asked. She not only gave proper treatment and managed the pregnancy from the very beginning, but also she motivated me to remain positive during pregnancy. She also counselled me well to try for normal delivery instead of going for a caesarian. She prescribed only the required medicine and focused on a natural diet and exercise rather than supplements. \nI did not have labour pain even after 40 weeks of gestation. Dr. Rinku induced labour and I gave birth to my little angel through normal delivery at Rainbow Hospital on 9 Dec 2022. Her team was indeed very supportive and encouraging during the labour.\nI am really thankful to Dr. Rinku Sengupta for giving me the best gift and supporting me throughout the pregnancy journey.",

If you dream of having normal delivery please see any gynecologist of this hospital. You will not feel that u r in India where urban families have accepted the truth that normal delivery is a past thing. Charges for hospitalization are kind of high but worth it. Not only doctors but their is staff is amazing. I delivered my bundle of joy 3 months back with the great team of doctors and Sister Rita George and Sister Anju.  I am thankful to Dr. Rinku for keeping my enthusiasm high for the normal delivery and I can't thank Sister Rita George and Sister Anju enough for being such a support during the active labor time. They were so fantastic at most difficult time.\nBest of luck and remember humans are supposed to deliver babies normally just like all other animals on this planet.",

She was recommended to me by a friend and I feel lucky to have consulted her during my entire pregnancy. She is an amazing doctor and human being. She is a non-sense doctor, she doesn't scare you with unnecessary medications or tests. She has such a motherly vibe around her. The best part is she is always available on the phone if you have any health issues- fever, or allergies, and she instantly advises you.  I CAN'T THANK HER ENOUGH for helping me bring my baby girl into the world. She was AMAZING support during the labor when you are the weakest and you need a mental and emotional lift, she will be right beside you!!! ",

Since then, I made my mind that in my second pregnancy, by the grace of Almighty, I will surely go to Dr.Rinku Sen Gupta for VBAC. In my very first visit, she stressed upon exercises which specifically helps in promoting VBAC. Dr. Rinku was like an angel to me during my labor. I was amazed to see how much effort Dr. Rinku and her staff were putting in. I was blessed with a baby boy on September 2 2022, via VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Cesarean). I had a Ceasarean earlier. I will highly recommend Dr Rinku Sengupta Dhar for VBAC.\n*** ** *** **** ** *** ******",

She has always been just a ping away, being a first time mom , I had so many queries and she was always there to answer all of them. She ensures you have a healthy lifestyle during pregancy which includes walking, yoga, meditation and healthy diet. My pregancy journey was very smooth all thanks to her.\nI had a normal virginal delivery and delivered a healthy baby all credits to Doc, at one point I had given up, but Dr. Rinku said just give me 2 hr, putting all our trust in her,  she ensured both baby and mother are fine.\n\nWe highly recommend her.",
