I started my journey with Dr. Bhaskar in the 5th month of my pregnancy, and from our very first consultation to the moment I held my baby in my arms, her expertise, compassion, and dedication were evident at every step.\n\nShe is an exceptional blend of professionalism and empathy. She took the time to explain every aspect of the procedure (vaginal and csec), addressing all of my concerns and ensuring I felt comfortable and informed. Both me and my husband always left her room with a positive outlook, knowing we are in good hands.\n\nDuring the surgery, Dr. Bhaskar's skill and precision were remarkable. The procedure was seamless, and her calm demeanor helped alleviate any anxiety I had. I felt completely safe under her care. The post-operative care she provided was equally outstanding. She was attentive, responsive, and genuinely concerned about my recovery and well-being.\n\nI cannot thank Dr. Jyoti Bhaskar enough for the exceptional care she provided. She made what could have been a stressful experience into a joyous and memorable one. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Bhaskar to anyone in need of a caring, skilled, and compassionate obstetrician. She is truly a blessing to her patients and a remarkable professional in her field.\n\nI would also like to thank the nursing staff at CloudNine for their care.  Special thanks to Trisha, Ritu, Nikita, Sunita and Anita for the support.\n",

I started my journey with Dr. Bhaskar in the 5th month of my pregnancy, and from our very first consultation to the moment I held my baby in my arms, her expertise, compassion, and dedication were evident at every step.\n\nShe is an exceptional blend of professionalism and empathy. She took the time to explain every aspect of the procedure (vaginal and csec), addressing all of my concerns and ensuring I felt comfortable and informed. Both me and my husband always left her room with a positive outlook, knowing we are in good hands.\n\nDuring the surgery, Dr. Bhaskar's skill and precision were remarkable. The procedure was seamless, and her calm demeanor helped alleviate any anxiety I had. I felt completely safe under her care. The post-operative care she provided was equally outstanding. She was attentive, responsive, and genuinely concerned about my recovery and well-being.\n\nI cannot thank Dr. Jyoti Bhaskar enough for the exceptional care she provided. She made what could have been a stressful experience into a joyous and memorable one. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Bhaskar to anyone in need of a caring, skilled, and compassionate obstetrician. She is truly a blessing to her patients and a remarkable professional in her field.\n\nI would also like to thank the nursing staff at CloudNine for their care.  Special thanks to Trisha, Ritu, Nikita, Sunita and Anita for the support.\n",

The last few weeks that I have consulted you in my pregnancy under your medical supervision made me feel more confident for delivery and listening to all our doubts and concerns so patiently and politely.\nI felt you bring all points to be discussed with patients without even asking anything by the patient. \nOur heartfelt thanks to you and your all Apollo Cradle Staff for all the love, support, care and of course for our baby.

I could not even walk due to severe vomiting and nausea, but she gave me mental support and timely advice.Sometimes, I found her strict and scolding me like my mother, but i knew it was for my good. Delivery was very smooth and whole transition of me becoming mother was possible due to her advice and blessings.Today, I and my family are happy with our little angel.Past 10 months got passed leaving behind her imprints on my heart. Love you ma'am!Regards,Tuhina",
