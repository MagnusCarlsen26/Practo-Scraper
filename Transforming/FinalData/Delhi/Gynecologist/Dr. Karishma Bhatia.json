After getting consulted with few other gynaecologists, I FINALLY got the satisfactory experience from Dr. KARISHMA BHATIA. From the very first appointment until the moment my baby was born, she demonstrated a true professionalism, ********** and compassion.\nHer friendly and humble attitude made last weeks of my pregnancy easy. Really\u2026 \nShe's an amazing doctor and a wonderful person.\nHer exceptional quality is she is not judgemental and she is available on call and responds quickly at any hour of the clock ! \nI can\u2019t forget her response at MID-NIGHT when I got my labour pain, she keeps calling and texting me till she reached the hospital for my delivery.. where do we get a doctor like her ?\n\nHer Clinic staff is really helpful. I am really grateful to Mr Joey and Miss Khushboo for the kind service they provided. \n\nI would highly recommend Dr. Karishma to any expectant mother seeking a compassionate, skilled* *** ************* gynaecologist. \nI am grateful for her expertise and support, and I would entrust my care to them again without hesitation.\n\nThank you Ma\u2019am ! \ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude0a ",

The entire diagnosis was well coordinated by Pristyn team and Dr. Karishma was very much supportive attentive throughout the procedure. The Pristyn team along with Dr Karishma were available at the Apollo Hospital where diagnosis was done. There was no tension for insurance claim because they are well tied-up with good quality hospital channels. She is such a positive, cheerful and friendly women that we decided not to visit to any other doctor for our purposes.  She always listens carefully and advise patiently. She is so friendly that me and my husband fell very much comfortable visiting her for any issue and we highly recommend everyone to consult her for one-stop treatment for any gyno related issues. We are very much sure that our association with Dr. Karishma would be fruitful. Thank you Dr. Karishma for all help and assistance. ",

The Pristyn team along with Dr Karishma were available at the Apollo Hospital where diagnosis was done. There was no tension for insurance claim because they are well tied-up with good quality hospital channels. She is such a positive, cheerful and friendly women that we decided not to visit to any other doctor for our purposes.  She always listens carefully and advise patiently. She is so friendly that me and my husband fell very much comfortable visiting her for any issue and we highly recommend everyone to consult her for one-stop treatment for any gyno related issues.

Dr in Chennai asked us to be very careful through her pregnancy, as the cervix was very short when the third month scan was done. In Delhi we were looking for an experienced doctor to take it forward from the third month. We met Dr Karishma bhatia and she guided us all the way from there. After the 5th month scan  my wife's cervix was less than 14mm and Cervical cerclage was suggested to us by Dr Karishma and we went for it. All medicine and check was so critical after that. finally on 14th July we were blessed with a baby boy and happiness & satisfaction was so much that it can't be explained in words. we were so lucky to connect to a person like Dr Karishma bhatia. As not only a doctor she was guiding us like family. I strongly recommend here and request every one to have full trust here.  ",

I also consulted her earlier regarding my infertility treatments & now  I am blessed with a daughter. I will be grateful to her all my life.

I met her in September 2020 regarding the problem of not conceiving the baby. After having a few tests i got to know that i had a PCOD problem. In-between a treatment of 6 months from Dr Karishma i got pregnant & i gave birth to a baby boy in 2021.Again in November 2022 i got pregnant and gave birth to another baby boy. During my pregnancy Dr Karishma supported me a lot. With the great moral support of Dr Karishma i am now living a beautiful life with my babies.I would recommend Dr. Karishma Bhatia if anyone has the problem regarding pregnancy. Thanks Dr Karishma Bhatia from the deepest of my heart for making my life fabulous.\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95",
