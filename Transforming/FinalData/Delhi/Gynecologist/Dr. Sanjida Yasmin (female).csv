"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"At the outset I would like to state that for the great doctor as Dr.Sanjida Yasmin there are actually no words to write a review and rather as a couple we would like to take this opportunity to extend our gratitude towards her for being the most dedicated, thoughtful, and compassionate doctor that she is! She always goes above and beyond and work tirelessly towards a healthy outcome. We as a couple feel so blessed to know her and have her as our doctor.”

We have heard so much around pregnancy around us that we were afraid if we will be able to manage that, more specifically when we are not from Delhi and could find Dr.  Sanjida only through Practo and trust us one would not find a gynae as good as her. Initially I was in consultation with some other doctor but there I could not feel the comfort that I required as a first time “Mommy to be” but when it comes to Dr. Sanjida the only thing that strikes my mind is that she makes your pregnancy journey so soothing and comforting with her always positive attitude and inspirational words that even the toughest issues seem solvable. The pregnancy experience which she gave me indeed have a lifelong impact on me as I could not have imagined my entire pregnancy journey to be as smooth as she not only said she will make but also made it a reality till my delivery and even thereafter.

We were too keen to have a normal delivery but was not aware if that could be possible in my case. I remember Dr. Sanjida’s words amply clear that the only thing I need to do is keep my will power strong and stay motivated to have a normal delivery and rest leave it to her and I did exactly that and finally on 07.10.2022 I had a normal delivery and delivered a healthy Baby Boy.  My child is indeed very fortunate to have been born through Dr. Sanjida’s hands. We thank her for all the support and care throughout 9 months and even till now in my postpartum journey. 
She is outrightly one of most modest person I have known despite being so successful. I love the way she handles all your issues whether medical or financial. One can literally ask her all their queries and she would certainly clarify each of such query without any hesitation. As a doctor I believe the kind words and considerate approach towards issues also solves a lot of problems of the patient and Dr. Sanjida Yasmin has so much patience and literally listens to every word of her patient and I can never thank her enough for her continued undivided attention. 
Out of countless good things about the doctor some of the most prominent ones that I would like to mention are as;
	Thorough Knowledge about her field with immense experience that will loudly speaks for itself which one will be able to judge at the very first time you will meet her. 
	24/7 availability for all your issues 
	Calm, composed and positive attitude towards all problems
	Outstanding motivation and guidance in labour room 
	Extremely focused and dedicated 
	Encourages queries that the expecting parents might have
	Straightforward with patient regarding the issues and challenges but in such a kind and considerate manner to keep the patient comforted and motivated.
	Takes care of even the minutest thing from room allotment to staff selection during delivery, financial schemes/offers for expecting mothers from the hospital and even the small events like baby shower organized by hospital for expecting mothers and all these undoubtedly gives one an overall memorable experience 

Literally I can keep writing for hours when it comes to Dr. Sanjida. There are very few people in life who have such high and positive impact on your life and mine has been blessed to have an outstanding experience with Dr. Sanjida Yasmin. As a doctor, she has gone above and beyond everything, I ever would have expected. As a first-time parent, undergoing childbirth is a mix of immense pain followed by immense happiness and in this journey the blessing of having an amazing doctor is beyond words. 

I am literally grateful for her kindness whenever I see her.

I strongly recommend every aspiring pregnant woman to reach out to her (Dr. Sanjida Yasmin, MBBS, DGO, DNB, Senior Consultant, Gynaecologist & Obstetrician, Fellowship in Infertility) for her best guidance throughout your 9 months of pregnancy and even thereafter. ** *** ******* *********** ******* ****** ***** *** ** *** ******************* ************** ****** * ******** *********************** ***** ** *****

Words are not enough to thank Dr. Sanjida but if I tell you about her, she only reminds me of a Hippocratic oath in which a physician pledges to prescribe only beneficial treatments, according to his abilities and judgment. 
Two excerpts in particular, one from the classical Hippocratic oath and the other from contemporary version may give you an introduction of Dr. Sanjida, who I have experienced follows it in its true Spirit.
Following excerpt from Classical Hippocratic oath reads
“...I will follow that system of regimen which, according to my ability and judgment, I consider for the benefit of my patients, and abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous… With purity and with holiness I will pass my life and practice my Art..”
And this from the contemporary version of the Oath reads as
“...I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.”
