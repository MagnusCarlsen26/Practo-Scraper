She  guides in a very friendly manner and makes her patients understand what needs to be done for our own betterment. The medication prescribed by her are definitely worth treating anything for good . Be it related to delayed menstrual cycle , egg formation or even meds during entire pregnancy that are completely safe. She gives time to her patients and makes sure that the issues are heard and resolved to the core. I am very thankful to ma'am as she helped each and every way to bring my bundle of joy in this world. From certain medicines to the care I needed having high risk pregnancy , still she went way up to the mark to help deliver vaginally , i.e. , normal delivery. I chose normal over c section and although she didn't commit for it but she did her best to make it happen and it did so . That's my greatest contentment for ma'am as doctor for my entire life.  Moreover , she reached the hospital on time when I needed this was again a big time support system I required as I was very comfortable with her and had asked to be there during delivery . \nEven before pregnancy , she guided very appropriately as to how to conceive , what should be done what things to avoid , like it was mandatory for me to shed a lot of weight she had been telling it several times but it was possible only when I actually took it seriously and works upon my weight management. Plus I was having difficulty in conceiving due to certain issues . She didn't prescribe any kind of unnecessary medicine anytime . She helped thoroughly by prescribing only apt meds to be taken *** ** ****** ******* * I am really happy and definitely look forward for any sort of advice she has given and would give anytime in future . \nI have gained confidence even if I'll want to have another child I'll definitely consult her . For those looking forward to become pregnant and want to have proper and positive care before , during and after pregnancy shall anyways consult Dr Shalini Agarwal . She will turn out to be a big time support pillar . \nShe cares for her patients and I feel if there is a bond between a doctor and her patient in this situation , the joy of delivery becomes double. Five star to her anytime and always .",

She is friendly in terms which is most important for a patient to pair repo with respected doctor to explain and ask every single concern and doubt.\nShe is definitely a doctor by profession and well carrying her skills however I would say i am more impressed from her behaviour, patience and professionalism as a doctor and person. We have had a smooth pregnancy and delivery under her consultation and supervision. When it comes to health and safety, she handeled it extremely well and on utmost priority.\nI would highly recommend Dr Shalini and wish her all the very best.\nThank You!\nShivani!",

I would rate and recommend Dr Shalini highly.I would also like to give special mention to support staff (Raja Kumar & girl i think Raj Kumari is her name) they were also very nice and supporting for any coordination with Dr Shalini, booking tests , having samples collected at home or managing at the clinic with appointment timings etc. they helped in every aspect to give us a very smooth and hassle free experience during the period.and made sure that waiting time was also minimum.thanks to Dr Shalini and her support staff.

I visited for my pregnancy confirmation & further precautions to be taken. Since it was my 1st pregnancy I was excited & scared too.She guided me step by step throughout my trimesters. I was detected with gestational diabetic in my 1st trimester, which made me sad for my baby & later lifestyle but she always encouraged & took strict observations on my diet & weight. Even she recommended dietitian & Endocrinologist, which helped me a lot.Although with high risk pregnancy (being gestational diabetic), she never commit for c-section or normal delivery & asked me to be relaxed suggested exercises & helped to get normal vaginal delivery. My whole journey from pregnancy to delivery is made smooth sailing just because of the trust in the treatment of Dr. Shalini.Even after delivery she councelled me so well for my post partum depression & child care.I would highly recommend & suggest everyone to have firm faith & trust in your Doctor as they can only ensure smooth sailing of your hardship.Also would definitely mention the clinic staff( khushbu & Raja) are very helpful, caring & supported so well in this journey.Thank you.",

She told us to make up our mind about this pregnancy and then come again, which didn't go down well with us at that time.\nAfter few days, we decided to go on with the pregnancy and continued our consultation. Weeks after weeks, she handled this risky pregnancy very well and we realised that the Doctor's approach is to make the couple stronger, confident and stress free. She remained strict where it needs to be and friendly all the time.\nAt the time of caesarean delivery too, she was very confident and made us very much comfortable. Post pregnancy care was also well taught.\nI'm grateful to her that we are parents to a healthy and cute child now. It would have been difficult with some other Doctor for sure to fight this dual battle with pregnancy and diabetes. God bless her.\n\nShahab Siddiqui",

She  guides in a very friendly manner and makes her patients understand what needs to be done for our own betterment. The medication prescribed by her are definitely worth treating anything for good . Be it related to delayed menstrual cycle , egg formation or even meds during entire pregnancy that are completely safe. She gives time to her patients and makes sure that the issues are heard and resolved to the core. I am very thankful to ma'am as she helped each and every way to bring my bundle of joy in this world. From certain medicines to the care I needed having high risk pregnancy , still she went way up to the mark to help deliver vaginally , i.e. , normal delivery. I chose normal over c section and although she didn't commit for it but she did her best to make it happen and it did so . That's my greatest contentment for ma'am as doctor for my entire life.  Moreover , she reached the hospital on time when I needed this was again a big time support system I required as I was very comfortable with her and had asked to be there during delivery . \nEven before pregnancy , she guided very appropriately as to how to conceive , what should be done what things to avoid , like it was mandatory for me to shed a lot of weight she had been telling it several times but it was possible only when I actually took it seriously and works upon my weight management. Plus I was having difficulty in conceiving due to certain issues . She didn't prescribe any kind of unnecessary medicine anytime . She helped thoroughly by prescribing only apt meds to be taken *** ** ****** ******* * I am really happy and definitely look forward for any sort of advice she has given and would give anytime in future . \nI have gained confidence even if I'll want to have another child I'll definitely consult her . For those looking forward to become pregnant and want to have proper and positive care before , during and after pregnancy shall anyways consult Dr Shalini Agarwal . She will turn out to be a big time support pillar . \nShe cares for her patients and I feel if there is a bond between a doctor and her patient in this situation , the joy of delivery becomes double. Five star to her anytime and always .",

She is friendly in terms which is most important for a patient to pair repo with respected doctor to explain and ask every single concern and doubt.\nShe is definitely a doctor by profession and well carrying her skills however I would say i am more impressed from her behaviour, patience and professionalism as a doctor and person. We have had a smooth pregnancy and delivery under her consultation and supervision. When it comes to health and safety, she handeled it extremely well and on utmost priority.\nI would highly recommend Dr Shalini and wish her all the very best.\nThank You!\nShivani!",

I would rate and recommend Dr Shalini highly.I would also like to give special mention to support staff (Raja Kumar & girl i think Raj Kumari is her name) they were also very nice and supporting for any coordination with Dr Shalini, booking tests , having samples collected at home or managing at the clinic with appointment timings etc. they helped in every aspect to give us a very smooth and hassle free experience during the period.and made sure that waiting time was also minimum.thanks to Dr Shalini and her support staff.

I visited for my pregnancy confirmation & further precautions to be taken. Since it was my 1st pregnancy I was excited & scared too.She guided me step by step throughout my trimesters. I was detected with gestational diabetic in my 1st trimester, which made me sad for my baby & later lifestyle but she always encouraged & took strict observations on my diet & weight. Even she recommended dietitian & Endocrinologist, which helped me a lot.Although with high risk pregnancy (being gestational diabetic), she never commit for c-section or normal delivery & asked me to be relaxed suggested exercises & helped to get normal vaginal delivery. My whole journey from pregnancy to delivery is made smooth sailing just because of the trust in the treatment of Dr. Shalini.Even after delivery she councelled me so well for my post partum depression & child care.I would highly recommend & suggest everyone to have firm faith & trust in your Doctor as they can only ensure smooth sailing of your hardship.Also would definitely mention the clinic staff( khushbu & Raja) are very helpful, caring & supported so well in this journey.Thank you.",

She told us to make up our mind about this pregnancy and then come again, which didn't go down well with us at that time.\nAfter few days, we decided to go on with the pregnancy and continued our consultation. Weeks after weeks, she handled this risky pregnancy very well and we realised that the Doctor's approach is to make the couple stronger, confident and stress free. She remained strict where it needs to be and friendly all the time.\nAt the time of caesarean delivery too, she was very confident and made us very much comfortable. Post pregnancy care was also well taught.\nI'm grateful to her that we are parents to a healthy and cute child now. It would have been difficult with some other Doctor for sure to fight this dual battle with pregnancy and diabetes. God bless her.\n\nShahab Siddiqui",

I started consulting Dr. Shalini towards the end of 1st trimester. Everything was normal, my reports, ultrasound but during 23rd week I experienced mild pain in lower back and thought it was normal. Since the pain was constant, I met Dr. Shalini. She asked me to get hospitalized immediately as my cervix length was shortening. She performed Mc Donald's stitch and stopped further shortening. I was on maximum rest for next 4 months. In 37th week, my stitch was removed and in 39th week, I delivered a healthy baby through c section as my baby pooped in my tummy. It could have been a normal delivery otherwise. I am lucky that I consulted the right doctor who doesn't fish money from patients. She's very humble *** **************",

Then when she finally calls you in, she expects you to be quick with your explanation. That kind of pressure isn't fair on the patient. In a nutshell, when the patient has booked an appointment in advance, he/she should not be rushed. Ideally, the doctor should be there on time so that he/she doesn't feel the need to rush.Overall, she is polite. ",

I had previously had two miscarriages, so I was very apprehensive this time. But Dr Shalini was extremely patient and caring. Throughout my pregnancy, I found I could turn to her for any small or big problem and she took care of that promptly. Today we are blessed with a little girl and its all thanks to her only. God bless her!",
