"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Abdominal Hysterectomy,",0,0,YES,"She is a amazing doctor. I visited her for my wife . She was having abdominal on and off Pain issue for very long. I took her to many doctors before but got no relief. Then came to know Dr. Hamra. She was spot on with diagnosis and prescribed some tests and medication and my wife was better in 5 days. 
The doctor is kind and generous. I recommend her strongly. May God bless her so that she can bless all her patients with her skills.
