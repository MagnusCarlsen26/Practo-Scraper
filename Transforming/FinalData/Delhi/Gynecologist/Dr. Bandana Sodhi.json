Suffered from PCOS for 6yrs with irregular periods, my periods were back to normal within the first three months of her treatment. It's almost been 3yrs since I have been going to her. Now I have regular periods without any medication, like I told you she will prescribe medicines only if necessary. Although I still have cysts, I'm in a much better place than I was 6yrs before. I absolutely admire and adore Dr. Sodhi, very lucky to have found her on Google while I was on a quest for a gynaecologist who actually cared without being judgemental, and so easy to talk to. I would highly recommend her. ",

Suffered from PCOS for 6yrs with irregular periods, my periods were back to normal within the first three months of her treatment. It's almost been 3yrs since I have been going to her. Now I have regular periods without any medication, like I told you she will prescribe medicines only if necessary. Although I still have cysts, I'm in a much better place than I was 6yrs before. I absolutely admire and adore Dr. Sodhi, very lucky to have found her on Google while I was on a quest for a gynaecologist who actually cared without being judgemental, and so easy to talk to. I would highly recommend her. ",

Again, she did fantastic job and made her feel very comfortable and fearless during whole procedure, heard her concerns with patience and gave her all the options with pros and cons. She always asks the opinion of patients too. A very kind hearted and sweet doctor she is. Immense respect for her and I will recommend her to everyone.  God bless you ma'am.\n",

Also, she is very approachable over the phone as well and the response time is amazing. This is our second pregnancy and the gap is almost 10 years. We were shocked to see that now almost all the doctors gives you a very strong feeling of being commercialised and are ready to send you back even before your consultation begins however meeting Dr. Sodhi was such a delight. Plus her knowledge is much better and advanced than many other doctors who would prescribe age old medicines and dosages. She's a must visit and we would recommend her to everyone. We are sure you would come back with a smile. ",

There was an instance when my wife had some issue. Other practitioners said She has to go through surgical procedure. However She brought her impressive education and rich experience to solve this problem without any surgery. She has also been our obstetrician to our first child which we have been recently blessed with.Ma'am, we can't thank you more! We remain indebted to you!

But we were not ready for that as we didn't even know, if at all there is any problem that I can't conceive naturally. \nFinally we met Mam. She is such a humble human being. Wherein other doctors in the first meeting made me realize that I am too late, Mam gave me hope that there is nothing to worry and everything is normal as per my reports. Finally within few months of treatment, I conceived under her treatment. I had healthiest of pregnancy and gave birth to a baby girl without any complications. \nAlso to mention, whenever I had any problem, Mam was just a call/SMS away. ",
