"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",,0,0,YES,"I feel lucky living in Vasant Kunj because of close proximity and able to find a gem like Dr.Mamta Mishra. Not only me me but my baby feel connected to her voice and aura during those 9 months.
i am giving this feedback in two parts, one how she is as a person and another as a doctor.

Person:- I feel your behaviour matters when you are doctor, at the end they are also human being with medical gift. She is outrightly one of most modest person despite being so successful. I love the way she handles financial subjects very clear cut ,considerate and realist. You can ask and she will clarify all the financial queries of yours. Infact she will be considerate about your money and her response is so apt. She is practical and yet you are her precious patient whom she cares a lot. She has a bit of philosophical side which puts you at such a ease while talking to her

Doctor- complete knowledge about her field, you just have to ask the right question. I have visited her clinic mostly and fortis hospital in the 3rd trimester. During every visit she will do her observation with concentration then will give you time to ask your queries. I feel she finds her clinic very close to her heart and very caring in that space. She did forget me as a patient during the initial trimester but again cant pinpoint her for that. I liked her as a person and her positive aura as a doctor. I have understood her nature and showed my honest trust on her advice. 

Procedure: My 9 month of pregnancy was less complicated and same feeling was created by Dr. Mamta Mishra. There was subserosal fibroid but that didn’t interfere with pregnancy. I chose to  get delivered by Ma’am hence chose fortis as my delivery hospital. At the end there was slight issue of gestational diabetics which might have been resulted in insulin injection but not needed at the end. After 38 week I was given induced labor pain under the guidance of Mamta ma’am which was successful and i delivered a healthy baby after 12 hrs of induction process. There was flow of blood from Utreus after delivery whose reason was unknown. But ma’am was able to stop the blood flow and stopped the mishappening , the procedure took another 1 hr and episiotomy stitched given by ma’am was perfectly intact. I am writing this 1 week after my delivery. 

I would recommend every aspiring pregnant women to her for better guidance and relaxing 9 months. If any further information needed please reach out.

Thankyou Mamta Ma’am

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Endometriosis Treatment,Fibroids Removal Surgery,Pregnant,",0,0,YES,"I was suffering from severe period pain due to endometriosis & Fibroids and was unable to conceive due to this disease.
I visited too many famous doctors in Delhi and NCR. They all mentioned that I will have to undergo an “Open myomectomy” and may need to remove the uterus or ovary along with Fibroids & Endo, and the chances for pregnancy very low or no chances.
I was not in favour of open myomectomy and no one gave me a positive hope.

One of my friend asked me to visit Dr Mamta Mishra. And I thought lets just try for the last time before I decide.
Then I visited Dr Mamta and she reviewed all my ultrasound reports in detailed and provided me detailed information about the Endometriosis & Fibroids. I was so happy and positive to see how a busy doctor can spend so much time on your case. She mentioned that I have to undergo Endometriosis and fibroid removal surgery because the fibroids & Endo are too big in size and they are blocking my pregnancy. She said she will try for laparoscopic myomectomy but the chances are low. I was so positive with Dr Mamta and decided to get this surgery done. March 2021 was the month of my surgery, Dr Mamta tried her best and removed all my fibroids with “Laparoscopic Myomectomy”. The surgery took almost 6-7 hour but she spent her whole day on my surgery so that I don’t have to suffer with “Open myomectomy”. After my surgery, she asked me to be positive for my pregnancy as she tried her best to not to touch my uterus, tubes and ovaries during suregry. 

In July 2021, I got pregnant naturally. ** **** **** *** ** *** ** *** **** ****** * **** **** *** ** ** **** *** I would highly recommend all to please do not loose hopes and must visit Dr Mamta Mishra before you decide anything.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy care and management,",0,0,YES,"Rather than review, we as couples would rather call it a note of gratitude for Dr. Mamta Mishra. If you want to trust the natural process of delivery, you will not find a doc as good as her. The pregnancy experience which she creates will have a life long impact on you as few things like “trust your body” is very rare to come straight from doctor’s mouth. 

We had heard so much around pregnancy around us that we were actually afraid if we will be able to manage that. But her simple advices, 24/7 availability for your problems, calm and composed approch to your issues, her motivation in labor room and no extra expense are just few to state.

Only doc I have visited recently who does not have any tie up with any lab and you can get your tests done anywhere you want, No issues of medicines being available at a particular shop (you will easily get anywhere and they are not expensive), no supplements till it is actually required as she will motivate you to get those from natural food are again just few things you will love about her.

It would not have been possible for us to have such a smooth vaginal delivery experience without her.

Do visit her for a stress free and pocket friendly delivery experience.

My wife was suffering from GDM and she was on metformin.Madam told us not to worry much and eat freely and keep on monitoring sugar levels.After that we did not worry and by God's grace sugar remained in control and finally we gave birth to a baby boy with normal delivery. 

Qualities which we like most about Dr. Mamta Mishra are as follows:
a) She is straightforward and never tried to be extra sweet or strict.After talking with her we always have clarity and built a trust on her.
b) She always tries her level best for normal delivery and always encouraged us to have patience.
