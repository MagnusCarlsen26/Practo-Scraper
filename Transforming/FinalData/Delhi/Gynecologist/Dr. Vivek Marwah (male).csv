,"Hysterectomy (Abdominal/Vaginal),",0,0,YES,"Just one phrase is enough to describe Dr Marwah - ** ** *** ******** **** ** *** needs to undergo gynaecology related surgery. We visited him for my wife's problems of endometriosis and fibroids after consulting several doctors in Delhi and NCR. By that time, we knew that hysterectomy was the only option for her as she was living with extreme pain. But even in that critical stage, Dr Marwah reassured us and even managed to save one ovary during the surgery. What's more, my wife recovered quite fast, considering the stories we had heard about slow and painful recovery of hysterectomy patients. We only wish we had known about Dr Marwah earlier, maybe hysterectomy won't have been needed at all ... ",2023-06-17 07:44:29,False,True,Saikat Chakraborty,,,
