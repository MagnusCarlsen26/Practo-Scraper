This doctor might be good in providing treatment but I would not advice anyone to visit her clinic. The clinic is run very unprofessionally. First time I had booked an appointment with the doctor, she arrived 1.5 hour late in the clinic itself.
I though it might be one of the instances but the second time I booked the appointment, I got a call on the day of appointment to cancel it and reschedule it for next day, I agreed. Next day they called me and requested me to come 30 mins late from the appointment time. I agreed. When I had already left home they called at that time and said doctor is not available today.
They have no value for other’s time. The staff in unprofessional they are unable to handle  customers.
