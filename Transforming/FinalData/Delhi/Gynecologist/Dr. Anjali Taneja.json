I was a little skeptical to book an appointment initially after reading the reviews as I could not find even a single negative review for her on google. But now, after my delivery I understand why there is not a single negative comment against her. She is a commendable doctor. So down to earth and kind. My visits with her have been so soothing throughout the pregnancy. She has never let any negative thought wander around me, before and after delivery. She is till date a support system for me. She understands me very well and gives genuine advices. I had to go in emergency C-section due to the circumstances and I was extremely nervous. She was right there standing beside me calming me down during the operation prep. My operation also went smooth and I did not have any severe pain afterwards. I would highly recommend Dr. Anjali Taneja to people like me, who do a lot of research and thinking before making big decisions. ",

I was a little skeptical to book an appointment initially after reading the reviews as I could not find even a single negative review for her on google. But now, after my delivery I understand why there is not a single negative comment against her. She is a commendable doctor. So down to earth and kind. My visits with her have been so soothing throughout the pregnancy. She has never let any negative thought wander around me, before and after delivery. She is till date a support system for me. She understands me very well and gives genuine advices. I had to go in emergency C-section due to the circumstances and I was extremely nervous. She was right there standing beside me calming me down during the operation prep. My operation also went smooth and I did not have any severe pain afterwards. I would highly recommend Dr. Anjali Taneja to people like me, who do a lot of research and thinking before making big decisions. ",

I was in desperate need for good guidance especially because I was only 4 months away from delivery. \n\nIn our first meeting Dr. Anjali not only guided us about things expected for the fifth month, but also thoroughly monitored all my previous reports to make sure nothing essential is left undone. \n\nThroughout the process, she carefully guided me about the ideal diet, precautions and medication. \n\nBeing a firm believer of natural methods, she always suggested home remedies first to improve my haemoglobin levels and baby's weight. \n\nThroughout the process she was just a call away which gave me the confidence that I was in safe and credible hands.\n\nAt the time of delivery too, we waited for circumstances to allow for normal vaginal delivery. I remained in early stage of labour for 24 hours without much progress in dilation of the cervix. Even at that stage she suggested that I wait for normal delivery but if I choose otherwise she will respect that choice which she did. \n\nI decided to go for a c section and she agreed immediately. \n\nThroughout the process of pregnancy and delivery I experienced her non judgemental attitude towards all my choices which is a rare thing to see. I found Dr. Anjali to be a thorough professional with an eye for detail and an immense ability to read through the technicalities. \n\nMost importantly, she was always polite and compassionate towards me like she must be with all her patients. This is especially important during pregnancy which is a very challenging time for any woman. \n\nAlso, she always involved both me and my husband in all discussions and decisions, which was a thing missing with other doctors I visited. \n\nI would strongly recommend her services as a Gynaecologist and obstetrician.",

She is very polite and down to earth and will make you feel very comfortable right from your first appointment.\n\nI contacted her during my first pregnancy (feb 2021) and she was with me in this journey thought out. Special shout out to her for checking up on me during odd night hours when my bp and sugar were not in check.\n\nAlso, she came on Diwali (which is a big thing) to visit me when I was admitted in the hospital due to few complications.\n\nShe is one of the best doctors and I think I will keep recommending her to all the people.",

She is a great listener, patiently hears our queries and respond to them in as much as detail possible way. She always give much time to their patient, never ever in a hurry to send you out of the clinic. \nVery lesser no. of doctors respond your calls at odd timings, but she was available on calls and responded on messages too throughout my pregnancy.\nExtraordinary excellent experience with Dr. Anjali Mam. \n\nHighly recommended gynecologist. \n\nThank you so so much Mam.",

Very friendly, polite and calmly listen to every query of yours\n2. Explain every problem and solutions and medications properly (Gives you time until your all query gets addressed and doubts cleared)\n3. Available always on call even post consulting to clear your doubts \n4. Very well experienced as before any problem happens , she gives hints so the patient doesn't get scare once the problem happens.\n5. My view on the doctor Anjali is very positive and if i have to rate my experience, then 10 on 10 ",

Best part is that she was available almost 24*7 which gives both physical and mental stability during pregnancy. Again when I expected for the second time in 2020, we consult her without giving a second thought and today I m a mother of two wonderful children.

Well, I was looking for a doctor who is knowledgeable, good at diagnosis, provides treatment/medicines that suits me, explains the symptoms and treatment properly, is dependable (answers her phone even at odd hours) and approachable in case of an emergency. I consulted with a lot of doctors in quite a few hospitals before deciding to stick with Dr. Anjali as my gynaecologist. She ticked all the boxes and offered so much more as a doctor. \nI had a c-section delivery that too late at night. Dr. Anjali did a fabulous job of the surgery and I didn\u2019t face any problems later on due to the surgery. I wholeheartedly recommend considering Dr. Anjali as your gynaecologist, but don\u2019t just take my word for it, take a consultation with her and see for yourself.",
