We initially chose Dr. Shilpa due to her convenience and minimal negative reviews. However, after just a few visits, it became crystal clear why she boasts so many positive ones.Her expertise shines through in her precise diagnoses, unparalleled counseling, and \u2013 the most surprising aspect \u2013 her exceptional patient follow-up. Unlike many doctors, she truly goes the extra mile to ensure her patients' well-being.A personal anecdote: When my wife wasn't feeling well, I called her and she responded immediately. With attentiveness, a prompt diagnosis, and her reassuring actions were good enough to save the day. Her dedication throughout my wife's pregnancy, from the very beginning to the delivery, solidified our belief that she's the best doctor around. She carries an aura around her, radiating reassurance and warmth that puts patients at ease.Are you in the early stages of pregnancy? Look no further! This review should end your search for an exceptional doctor. Dr. Shilpa really is a true gem in her field.",

We initially chose Dr. Shilpa due to her convenience and minimal negative reviews. However, after just a few visits, it became crystal clear why she boasts so many positive ones.Her expertise shines through in her precise diagnoses, unparalleled counseling, and \u2013 the most surprising aspect \u2013 her exceptional patient follow-up. Unlike many doctors, she truly goes the extra mile to ensure her patients' well-being.A personal anecdote: When my wife wasn't feeling well, I called her and she responded immediately. With attentiveness, a prompt diagnosis, and her reassuring actions were good enough to save the day. Her dedication throughout my wife's pregnancy, from the very beginning to the delivery, solidified our belief that she's the best doctor around. She carries an aura around her, radiating reassurance and warmth that puts patients at ease.Are you in the early stages of pregnancy? Look no further! This review should end your search for an exceptional doctor. Dr. Shilpa really is a true gem in her field.",

I don't know how she got positive reviews* ****** *** **** ******* ** may be she is polite only with patients visiting her personally in the clinic and are her permanent patients paying her regularly.\n She was in a hurry while talking on the video call and didn't listen our concerns properly. At exact 15th minute she dropped the call saying need to attend other patients without listening to us. I have taken appointments with other doctors also on practo but haven't seen such a behaviour. In-fact, I have been asked by doctors to wait 5-10 minutes if they are with other patients which I have waited patiently but never seen doctor who is rude and avoid answering your questions. Later I pinged her my concerns on whatsapp as she dropped practo call but she didn't answer and asked to visit clinic. I was sure after her response *** ** *** * **** ****** and should not wast e my time.\nHowever, Later I tried downloading the prescription she shared on practo chat as I needed that to be submitted in my office, but was not able  to download the file from chat. Therefore, I had to drop her note and request  to upload my prescription under practo medical records, but she responded that she don't know how to upload it under medical records. Then I requested her to send it on email which she responded that she don't know how to send email. Last I requested her to send on whatsapp which she didn't respond.  After waiting for 2 days for prescription, I called her directly on her phone and asked for prescription which she responded very rudely to me and told she lost the prescription and can't share and dropped the call. *** ** **** ** ******* * ****** *** ***** **** *** ** ****** **** *** *********  And Mam, its our wish we want to take second opinion of doctor or 3rd, we don't need your advice. We paid for the consultation and you were not giving any free consultation **** ** **** *** **** *** * **** *****I understood completely why you were not interested to answer our questions, you thought we are just taking second opinion and might not reach out to you again for consultation so why to wast e time on one time patients.  Guys, whoever reading this review, don't go for practo online consultation with her as she prefer only talking with her regular or in clinic patients who can pay her regularly.",

I first talked to her on the phone before I head out for her clinic,  she had a calm voice and there was friendliness n care in her tone..... Once starting out,  we got lost in directions(all thanks to google maps for wrong directions).... I had made appointment for 7:30,  but traffic n google maps happen and I reached her clinic when it was almost 8pm.... And all the while we were lost in directions,  she was on the phone with our OLA driver,  giving directions..... When we finally reach her residence also her clinic,  I was greeted with a warm and welcoming smile( it was 100% genuine).... Then when she finally get to examine me,  asking questions,  I  find myself opening up,  telling my problems, asking questions... I am suppose to be opening up since I'm the patient,  but I hardly am able to tell my problems to other doctors for fear of being judged..... But this time it was different..... This shows how friendly the doctor,  the atmosphere was friendly n calm,  she was attentive n a good listener.... She explained so well about my problems, why I am having those problems,  and what I should do to cure myself... She prescribed some medicines n also some tests to run........ It was the first time that I could talk to a doctor as if she was my mom.......\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764 Glad to be taken care by a doctor like her...\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a God bless you Dr Shilpa",

Our earlier doctor already stated during 7 month usg checkup that the baby is breach. There is less water near baby and less hameoglobin in the mother. There is no chance of normal baby and she gave 7th march date for the operation. That we decided to consult other doctor and came to Dr. Shilpa. The way she comfortable us and made my wife understand about the complications and the way we can overcome it. We followed the same steps that she advised and by god\u2019s grace all the complications were gone and we became parent of healthy baby boy and the delivery was normal. Even during the delivery she waited for more than 12 hours for having the delivery. She not even once said we will do scissorian. Thank you so very much Dr. Shilpa ma\u2019am.

We contacted her around 9 months ago and was very nervous about what we should do as my wife was pregnant and was ready to give birth to our 2nd child. When Dr.Shilpa at that time we were very nervous as our 1st child was born with certain complications. When we contacted her she gave us lot of confidence and courage and told us that we should go for it. My wife had several pregnancy complications as she had Thyroid, Gestational Diabetes , Cholestasis etc. and almost all other problems which you can think of. She handled all the complications very well and my wife finally gave birth to baby Girl on 22nd of January in fortis hospital. I feel that she is very professional and someone who takes care of your patients and will make you feel comfortable as and when you will meet or talk to her.Dr.Shilpa cant thank you enough for your wonderful job. she is just great in what she is doing ..Kudos to Dr. Shilpa and her staff for taking care of us. I have become a lifetime fan of Dr. Shilpa Dhamija and i would recommend that incase if you are looking for Gynecologist than she is the best person to go for.",

I visited her for getting pregnant with pcod. We, as patients, think that pcod is just a period problem but there is a lot going on inside our bodies which is why a thorough diagnosis is required. Dr. Shilpa helped me understand all this in detail, advised the right diagnosis, medication, diet, etc. Soon I was able to conceive. There were certain issues in my early pregnancy phase and then I developed several other complications later including cholastasis and high BP making it a high risk pregnancy. However, with Dr. Shilpa's medical expertise, I was able to deliver a healthy baby boy via c section.Dr. Shilpa has been a wonderful support throughout. The best part is that she is always available and answers all your doubts/queries in detail. Pregnancy is a phase full of thousand of questions but with her, you will feel like you always have a friend by your side.I would definitely recommend her to expecting parents or those who are trying to have a baby.Again, I'd like to thank Dr. Shilpa for being so affectionate and understanding. I have never met a doctor with a positive and approachable personality like hers.",

The best part is she is available 24 hrs for her patients, we called her during odd hours of night also, during this period also for she is always guided us very rightly. she is rally nice, very quick in response, guides you very correctly. we are now a proud parent, where in I would say the 9 months passed so smoothly as she was  there, we have never feared or worried about any kind of complication. During this nine months there were many issues of low line placenta, then getting infected with COVID 19, but with the right guidance by Dr. Shilpa we have passed all these complications and blessed with a baby boy.\n\nBefore her we visited many other gynecologists, not to name anyone, but nothing like here. She is so gooooood. I will recommend everybody definitely visit here if you have anything related to gynecology.\n\nAt last a big thanks to Dr. Shilpa",

She has been extremely supportive from the very beginning and kept guiding us at every step. We never really felt the need to consult any other Doctor for our pre and Post Pregnancy period and she was always there whenever we needed. Below are some of the highlights that I believe really helped:\n\n1. Extremely empathetic and she talked more like a friend.\n2. Always available when needed. Be it call or whatsapp, she would always get back.\n3. Preparing and guiding us in our pre/post Pregnancy period and explaining everything in detail.\n4. Providing us our full time whenever we visited and we never once felt that she was in a hurry. She always listened and would proactively reach out when needed.\n5. Most important, she gave us the mental support from time to time that we really needed and you don\u2019t really expect that from doctors, atleast this was a first such experience for us.\n6. Also considered the financial aspect that a lot of Doctors miss out on. She would always give suggestions and provide free consultations from time to time.\n\nOverall We consider ourselves lucky to have met her and going through the most important phase of our life with Doctor Shilpa on our side. She finally helped us become proud parents on July 16 and kept following up with NICU doctors on our behalf, even when it was not her duty!!\n\nI would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for help or consultation and I can give you my personal guarantee that you are not going to regret it!!\n\nThanks again Dr. Shilpa, you have set a standard that we expect from all our Doctors now \ud83d\ude42\n\nFrom- Priya and Akash",

Better straight away approach Dr. Shilpa and get your work done . Every single penny paid to Dr. Shilpa is worth. Personally , Regarding personal care ,I remember when 8 month started  Dr. Shilpa used to call us for checking helath updates ,one of the most important thing she is available all the time even if you text her in the mid night,Tell me \"Who can be so kind this much in this 'modern running behind money world'?\". I am speechless to this kind hearted and professional .

On my first visit to her (which was just for taking second doctor's opinion), she made me feel so comfortable that I was able to openly explain my condition, concerns and issues. She very patiently listened to me and then explained all the possible treatment options and later on effects post MTP in a very clear manner. Before visiting her, I was in much stress about this procedure but after meeting her, me and my husband barely took a minute to conclude that we will go with Dr Shilpa only. She ensured a smooth prep, surgery and follow-up. She arrived before time and ensured that the procedure started timely, without letting us wait beyond the scheduled time. \nI am so glad I chose her and would highly recommend to anyone. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care.",

When I consulted her, she immediately consoled and counselled me and instilled a sense of confidence. Her approach to achieve the pregnancy goal was incorporating natural and healthy ways of life in daily routine instead of relying on any medicine or external support. I had a high risk and emotionally troublesome pregnancy but she held my hand in each and every step. Her availability 24*7 was a major source of comfort. Her prompt response during labour helped me to undergo the process smoothly. Her friendly guidance, vast experience, inclination for achieving success goal for patient and treatment process is what I recommend to each and every woman out there who is looking for best treatment. Thanks Dr Shilpa Dhameja. ",

It was her who guided me on the eating pattern and a diet so I could deliver a healthy baby.\nBoth me and my husband are so happy to have Dr. Shilpa as our mentor through this phase and will recommend others to see Dr. Shilpa for their need.\n\nThank you so much Shilpa Ma'am for all your support!!\n",

She took the time to listen to our concerns and answer all of our questions, which made us feel confident and reassured in her care.Moreover, Dr. Shilpa's attention to detail is truly remarkable. She is thorough in her examinations and always goes above and beyond to ensure that her patients receive the best possible care. In our experience, she took the time to understand our unique medical history and crafted a personalized treatment plan that was tailored to our specific needs.The care that Dr. Shilpa provides extends beyond the exam room, as she also takes the time to follow up with her patients and make sure that they are doing well. Her commitment to her patients is unparalleled, and we are grateful for her dedication and hard work.

Few recommendations really stand out in overall interactions - a) She avoided unnecessary allopathy and instead recommended iron rich diet to boost my hemoglobine levels. b) She advises minimum tests and scans.\nDr Shilpa was always available 24*7 for all doubts and queries even the trivial one\u2019s. The most trustworthy part is the ample medical knowledge and positive vibes she carries, which gave me complete strength and trust during my high risk delivery.\nI highly recommend the doctor.

In our case, there were few complications towards the end of the pregnancy and we were not getting much reassurance from the other doc's we'd consulted.  However, she was the only one who didn't scare us at such a critical time and gave us positive guidance to improve the condition using as much natural foods as possible along with some essential supplements. Also,  she continuously followed up with me and was always available over whatsapp/Call. She ensured i go through a normal delivery only, which is what we wanted and that the hospital gave us the proper attention and care.Very happy and grateful to her for our beautiful baby girl ",

Not only speaking about friendliness but what we really appreciate and liked about Dr Dhameja was she never deals her patient in hurry. She listens to all your concern and talks/explains about it all. Even before starting any medication or treatment she would make sure you understand what/why\u2019s of her treatment.\nAlso what I appreciate about the doctor is that she won\u2019t call you for unnecessary visits. She doesn\u2019t mind taking your questions on phone too; only if there is a need to visit she will call her patient. \nWe went to Dr Dhameja when we decided to start our family. With help of her counselling support and advises we are going to be parents soon. Thank you doc!",

Dr Shilpa is a humane doctor, she treats her patients with a lot of affection and with empathy. She is always available on phone to answer queries and allay doubts. Despite our numerous calls/messages, she was always helpful. Extremely competent in her field, I will always recommend her to all my family and friends. Thank you so much doctor for taking such good care.",

We didn't have any idea regarding which doctor to trust and where to go as there are thousands of doctors everywhere with all kinds of reviews. She was really nice in guiding us through every stage of pregnancy right from the diet to medicine everything. She was always available on WhatsApp even at night whenever we needed her with the smallest of doubts. I have seen patients following up with doctors regarding problems but this was the first time I saw a doctor following up whether the patient is feeling okay or not. Any money can't buy the care and suggestion that she has given us so we trusted her with our first baby and rightly so. Highly recommended and you can trust her with your eyes closed. Thanks a ton Dr. Shilpa for taking care of our baby during these 9 months.",

Even though I had little complication at the last stage, she ensured that I am not scared and made me prepared mentally and physically for the delivery, with her guidance  and support I am blessed with a healthy and beautiful baby.She is so caring and compassionate, Honestly, I have not met any doctor who is personally so involved with all their patients, what I liked about her is that he remembers the tiniest details you share with her. She will discuss your doubts  comfortably and will give you ample amount of time . You can feel the connection and the positive vibe with her. I highly recommend her, lastly I would just express my gratitude to her for all her care and advice, I am sooo happy to found  such a caring, empathic and passionate person.  ",

Dr. Shilpa was very friendly and gave us the right advise clinically and financially, at a time where I was being misled by other doctors. She took it as a challenge to remove the enlarged uterus laproscopically and the operation was carried out successfully by her and today the patient is healthy and very happy. \n\nShe\u2019s is an amazing doctor, makes patient feel super safe. I would definitely recommend her. She painstakingly explains each and every detail and her 24/7 support is something I have never seen. \n\nShe was readily available on phone whenever I needed. Could not have asked for a better doctor.",

There were some small complications with my wife's pregnancy but Dr. Shilpa explained all the things clearly to us and was very approachable to us on call and WhatsApp too. Because of her guidances given to us and her expertise in normal and c-sec delivery, my wife and baby both are doing very good. I would definitely recommend Dr. Shilpa for pre and post pregnancy.",

Since the beginning of my pregnancy when Corona was at its peak, Dr Shilpa became my favourite because of the much needed doctor-patient relationship that she provided me during that time. Her availability to her patients 24*7 over the phone/whatsapp is also very commendable.\nWith her medical advises and consultations, I gave birth to a healthy baby boy.\nCan't thank her enough for being the nicest doctor around in this time where other doctors are charging hefty fees for consultations but fail to satisfy the patients.\n\n",

As a patient...you feel really stressed about your problem. The doctor should atleast tell you what is it that's the problem. I kept asking but got no response. Only one worded replies about my report which was pretty obvious. My problem wasn't solved in the end which is the ultimate purpose and I felt she wasn't interested.

She is such lovely person she treats you like a family person. If you have any queries you could ask any time and she would reply to you in a minute. Moreover, she takes an update from you time to time offline. She is taking care of her patient like her baby. I had c section surgery and it went all well. After, giving a baby i still feels fresh. A big shout out to her. I highly recommend to Dr. Shilpa. If you have any problems you can share with her and she will have answers for you.\n\nMany thanks to Dr. Shilpa Dhameja.",
