,,0,0,YES,"** ****** ** ** ********* ****** *** a gem of a person. 
She explains everything very properly to her patients and is one of the most ethical doctors I have come across. 
Madam is well versed with all the latest updates in her field and she gives the best guidance to her patients. 
All words are less to explain the warmth and competence Dr Poonam has, and all I can say is that if one wants the most genuine,honest and ethical treatment, then please visit Dr Poonam.

,,0,0,YES,Dr Poonam Tara is an amazing Doctor as is always full of energy and positivity whenever you meet her. Whatever time of the day she is always brimming with positivity and energy. We went to her for pregnancy scans and consultation during a complicated situation during the 2nd trimester scans and were in very complicated and scary situation. She ensured that she brought in required additional consultants where needed and went out of her way to get inputs from many other senior doctors for us to help understand the situation and chose a path forward. She is a fabulous person always worried about the patients well-being and progress. An amazing doctor to help during a very complicated phase of our journey. Can’t thank you enough Doc.
