Such is the case with me and I found my angel in Dr. Shalini Chawla Khanna.\nIt was our 4th year of marriage and like any other couple we too had to undergo the usual concerns shared by parents, relatives and even neighbours on having a baby. I had a miscarriage in the first year and since then i wasn't able to conceive. Had visited several gynecologists (good ones) as suggested by family and friends but nothing worked out as no one could diagnose well and the related treatment was out of question . Dr. Shalini Chawla Khanna came into our lives when we had lost all hopes of becoming parents. She listened to all our concerns patiently by giving us all the time and addressed them all very well. She even explains the treatment and procedure recommended very well before going forward with it. I was diagnosed with multiple fibroids in my uterus and underwent laparoscopy myomectomy successfully under her treatment. Dr. Shalini Chawla Khanna is always avaliable on calls/whatsapp chats/messages. She doesn't put you in unnecessary medications nor will make you undergo unnecessary tests or visits. I had my complete trust in her and went with the suggested treatments which not only was the right one for me but also brought our dream of becoming parents a reality. Soooooooo Happy to announce the arrival of our little bundle of joy this October 2022. *** ******* ****** ****** ** *** **** ************* *********** *********** *** ********** *** ************ ******** I will always always recommend her. With all my heart I wish Dr. Shalini Chawla Khanna all the success and happiness in her life.",

Instead of trusting them we end up flooding them with queries and details.\nBut with Dr. Chawla after initial few interactions, we just surrendered because we developed so much of trust & reliance on her that all our fears vanished.\nThe gestation was also not easy for us because of my wife\u2019s age and Dr. Chawla was there with us right from egg extraction, fertilisation, embryo transfer & then pregnancy complications.\nShe coordinated & made sure that the gynaecologist is taking good care of us and participated fully in deciding various medications during stages so that we finally bring healthy kids home.\nShe was even following up with us after the birth of our daughters & it happens till date.\nI firmly believe now that doctors are angels.\n\nThanks Dr. Chawla for filling our lives with new joy.\n\nAmit & Bindu ************* *** ****** WE WILL RECOMMEND ",

Such is the case with me and I found my angel in Dr. Shalini Chawla Khanna.\nIt was our 4th year of marriage and like any other couple we too had to undergo the usual concerns shared by parents, relatives and even neighbours on having a baby. I had a miscarriage in the first year and since then i wasn't able to conceive. Had visited several gynecologists (good ones) as suggested by family and friends but nothing worked out as no one could diagnose well and the related treatment was out of question . Dr. Shalini Chawla Khanna came into our lives when we had lost all hopes of becoming parents. She listened to all our concerns patiently by giving us all the time and addressed them all very well. She even explains the treatment and procedure recommended very well before going forward with it. I was diagnosed with multiple fibroids in my uterus and underwent laparoscopy myomectomy successfully under her treatment. Dr. Shalini Chawla Khanna is always avaliable on calls/whatsapp chats/messages. She doesn't put you in unnecessary medications nor will make you undergo unnecessary tests or visits. I had my complete trust in her and went with the suggested treatments which not only was the right one for me but also brought our dream of becoming parents a reality. Soooooooo Happy to announce the arrival of our little bundle of joy this October 2022. *** ******* ****** ****** ** *** **** ************* *********** *********** *** ********** *** ************ ******** I will always always recommend her. With all my heart I wish Dr. Shalini Chawla Khanna all the success and happiness in her life.",

Instead of trusting them we end up flooding them with queries and details.\nBut with Dr. Chawla after initial few interactions, we just surrendered because we developed so much of trust & reliance on her that all our fears vanished.\nThe gestation was also not easy for us because of my wife\u2019s age and Dr. Chawla was there with us right from egg extraction, fertilisation, embryo transfer & then pregnancy complications.\nShe coordinated & made sure that the gynaecologist is taking good care of us and participated fully in deciding various medications during stages so that we finally bring healthy kids home.\nShe was even following up with us after the birth of our daughters & it happens till date.\nI firmly believe now that doctors are angels.\n\nThanks Dr. Chawla for filling our lives with new joy.\n\nAmit & Bindu ************* *** ****** WE WILL RECOMMEND ",

Just with such simple treatment of hers,   I conceived in first cycle of ovulation  Induction. Our joy knew no bounds and that was the happiest day of our lives when urine pregnancy test came positive after16 days of ovulation Induction.   She had been so positive and encouraging since day 1. Through put 9 months she guided  us and answered  all our queries be it during personal visits or over phone calls and messages. Dr. Shalini has always been available 24*7 for any query. \n\nWe sincerely thanks Dr. Shalini for blessing us with a son on 26th October 2020. ",

We consulted dozens of top doctors of Delhi/NCR, but nobody could help us increase the thin endometrium. Then we took help from Dr. Shalini Chawla Khanna as we had heard a lot about her excellence in infertility and IVF related issues. She suggested and did Hysteroscopy so perfectly that my wife's endometrium increased in just 2 months that was not happening since last 2 years even after working with so called other top doctors. We literally thank our stars that we met Dr. Shalini Chawala Khanna who finally successfully fixed a huge complication for us that no other top doctor could fix. Once my wife's endometrium was fixed, she immediately did IVF on her and her first IVF itself got successful and my wife is now pregnant. Dr. Shalini literally came in our lives when we lost all hope and she gave us life's most precious gift. To top that, she is so calm and gives homely/ motherly discussion feeling and gives positive vibes that my wife was super comfortable discussing everything with her. She really deserves reputation she has as one of best IVF and infertility related doctors. ",

Then she did Hysteroscopy and D& C under anaesthesia where she removed a polyp. . Surprizingly after the hysyeroscopy , my mothers cycles became regular . She again gave Tab Primolut - N for 2 months after hysteroscopy . Now she is absolutely fine . The cycles are regular now . I really thank my stars that I took my mom to her . We were saved from the hysterectomy  . Hysteroscopy was just a day care procedure . She was conscious 2 hours after the surgery and she was discharged in the evening . Hysteroscopy worked magic for her .All thanks to Dr. Shalini for saving my mother from a major surgery .   We are very happy with her . She is very good surgically . ",

I was worried and she assured me that the result of biopsy would most probably be okay,  but I need to undergo the procedure to rule out any other problem. During the procedure, she put me at ease and checked on me when I recovered. She is extremely good with her diagnosis,  explains the medical condition in detail, is very patient and friendly,  and puts the patient at comfort while treating. I highly recommend her.",

I had some bad experiences with the hospital and doctor I was consulting to before Dr. Shalini. I wanted a doctor who would help me out for a safe delivery and guide me pre and post pregnancy. I was super stressed as I was already nearing my due date and still did not have a doctor and hospital for my delivery. Dr  shalini came as a blessing in my life and I can't thank her enough for making my pregnancy, delivery so wonderful and smooth. \nShe is friendly and full of motherly warmth. You won't feel you are talking to a doctor. I would highly recommend Dr. Shalini to everyone who are seeking a doctor who is not just a knowledgeable doctor but also a good human being with warmth and affection. \nWith her help and guidance I was blessed with a baby girl, healthy and happy on 19th June 2021 at Triton hospital. \n\nThank you so much Dr. Shalini",

And we thank our stars that we chose Dr. Shalini . The surgery was done so well . All the Endometriomas were removed , the Fallopian tubes were opened up . I recovered within a week . We had never imagined that life would take a 360 degree turn and I would conceive with simple ovulation Induction drugs like - Clomiphene and that too within 6 months of Laparoscopy . Never expected Clomiphene will work like a Magic. All thanks to Dr. Shalini and my hubby for finding her. May God bless her.",

She studied our case so thoroughly and gave us so much attention that we became quite positive of conception .  Her treatment is very simple and at every step she explains which we liked the best. Previously we had undergone ICSI but with Dr. Shalini we conceived with IVF only . She doesn't write unindicated tests and expensive  medicines . She is very polite , humble and hard working  .  Her  motive is to make everyone pregnant . We really fall short of words if we have to describe her . She has all the qualities of an ideal Doctor . All thanks to her for brightening our lives .",

Her positivity and knowledge made us believe that she is the right doctor for us . We underwent IVF + PGS with her and out of 7 embryos ,only 2 were healthy embryos which she implanted and to our surprise,  it clicked and I conceived after so many years of struggle.

She is the ONLY doctor I have come across who listened to what I had to say and actually take it seriously. She is happy to address concerns and doubts and doesn\u2019t dismiss them without an explanation. She is genuinely caring and has a friendly demeanor. Made me feel very comfortable and I actually looked forward to meeting her on appointments. She is also really approachable and is pretty accommodating with her timings. Overall, I am very happy with her and would recommend her to everyone.",

We already had undergone 2 IUIs but nothing worked . When we first met Dr. Shalini , she thoroughly examined our case and gave us so much positivity and hope and we really got impressed with her positivity .  She explained  probably it was unexplained  infertility . She gave us all options of Laproscopy / Ovulation Induction but we decided to go for IVF . Treatment with her was so easy as contrary to we had heard that IVF is very painful . She gave very minimal injections and IVF procedure was so easy with her . First cycle , I underwent fresh embryo embryo transfer which didn't work . Second cycle ,  I underwent Blastocyst transfer and our joy knew no bounds when the test came positive after 12 days . Throughout  9 months ,she supported us . Always answering our queries and all Thanks to her for giving us this little munchkin.  \n*** ** ****** ** *** ***** ** *********** *** *** * Highly recommended for infertility services . \n**** *** ****** **** ** **** ** *",

After trying treatment from.various doctors , we visited Dr. Shalini who is a beautiful soul of GOD always ready to help and guide . Though 2 cycles of IUI didnt bring any success and eventually we had to move to Banglore because of work . But our heart stuck there with Dr. Shalini . We had so much faith in her that eventually we decided to undergo IVF with her only.  She is highly passionate for her work and her dedication is beyond words . And we were lucky enough to conceive with her in first attempt ,though delivery happened in Banglore . And we are blessed with 2 naughty boys . Thanks Dr. Shalini for completing our family .",

All the cases that we met while waiting for her, are now proud parents... She has an extremely good success rate and tries all different combinations to see which may suit your body..\n If you are looking for an infertility specialist who will understand you and help you through the journey, making very much comfortable I suggest reaching out to her.",

We visited her and what a start it was! She started with some tests and diagnosed correctly, an endometrial polyp. She suggested hysteroscopy and personally got my ultrasound done. After doing hysteroscopy she put me at ease and checked on me when I recovered. Then she suggested IVF procedure for pregnancy. Without giving a thought we went ahead for it and finally, I conceived.\n\nDr. Shalini was there with us for whole nine months. She was just a call away to answer all my queries. Her professionalism & personal touch to the process was felt in every action. With God\u2019s grace & her hard work, we were blessed with the most precious gift of our life. A baby boy!\n\nWe would like to thank Dr Shalini for all she did for us. She is extremely kind, caring and friendly. Overall, highly recommended.\n\nThank you Doctor!",

However when we met Dr Shalini , said nothing is impossible & explain the treatment. After that we followed the IVF treatment as for us it was  strange but the way she prepared us for the IVF treatment was brilliant. The best thing was her friendliness,  polite nature &  availability  of 24*7 during whole IVF treatment. In the first attempt of IVF treatment we were conceived & blessed with twin babies.\nThanks from the bottom of heart to Dr Shalini chawal khanana I.e second God for us.",
