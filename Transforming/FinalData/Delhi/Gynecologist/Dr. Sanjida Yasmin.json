                "review_text": "At the outset I would like to state that for the great doctor as Dr.Sanjida Yasmin there are actually no words to write a review and rather as a couple we would like to take this opportunity to extend our gratitude towards her for being the most dedicated, thoughtful, and compassionate doctor that she is! She always goes above and beyond and work tirelessly towards a healthy outcome. We as a couple feel so blessed to know her and have her as our doctor.\u201d\n\nWe have heard so much around pregnancy around us that we were afraid if we will be able to manage that, more specifically when we are not from Delhi and could find Dr.  Sanjida only through Practo and trust us one would not find a gynae as good as her. Initially I was in consultation with some other doctor but there I could not feel the comfort that I required as a first time \u201cMommy to be\u201d but when it comes to Dr. Sanjida the only thing that strikes my mind is that she makes your pregnancy journey so soothing and comforting with her always positive attitude and inspirational words that even the toughest issues seem solvable. The pregnancy experience which she gave me indeed have a lifelong impact on me as I could not have imagined my entire pregnancy journey to be as smooth as she not only said she will make but also made it a reality till my delivery and even thereafter.\n\nWe were too keen to have a normal delivery but was not aware if that could be possible in my case. I remember Dr. Sanjida\u2019s words amply clear that the only thing I need to do is keep my will power strong and stay motivated to have a normal delivery and rest leave it to her and I did exactly that and finally on 07.10.2022 I had a normal delivery and delivered a healthy Baby Boy.  My child is indeed very fortunate to have been born through Dr. Sanjida\u2019s hands. We thank her for all the support and care throughout 9 months and even till now in my postpartum journey. \nShe is outrightly one of most modest person I have known despite being so successful. I love the way she handles all your issues whether medical or financial. One can literally ask her all their queries and she would certainly clarify each of such query without any hesitation. As a doctor I believe the kind words and considerate approach towards issues also solves a lot of problems of the patient and Dr. Sanjida Yasmin has so much patience and literally listens to every word of her patient and I can never thank her enough for her continued undivided attention. \nOut of countless good things about the doctor some of the most prominent ones that I would like to mention are as;\n\uf0a7\tThorough Knowledge about her field with immense experience that will loudly speaks for itself which one will be able to judge at the very first time you will meet her. \n\uf0a7\t24/7 availability for all your issues \n\uf0a7\tCalm, composed and positive attitude towards all problems\n\uf0a7\tOutstanding motivation and guidance in labour room \n\uf0a7\tExtremely focused and dedicated \n\uf0a7\tEncourages queries that the expecting parents might have\n\uf0a7\tStraightforward with patient regarding the issues and challenges but in such a kind and considerate manner to keep the patient comforted and motivated.\n\uf0a7\tTakes care of even the minutest thing from room allotment to staff selection during delivery, financial schemes/offers for expecting mothers from the hospital and even the small events like baby shower organized by hospital for expecting mothers and all these undoubtedly gives one an overall memorable experience \n\nLiterally I can keep writing for hours when it comes to Dr. Sanjida. There are very few people in life who have such high and positive impact on your life and mine has been blessed to have an outstanding experience with Dr. Sanjida Yasmin. As a doctor, she has gone above and beyond everything, I ever would have expected. As a first-time parent, undergoing childbirth is a mix of immense pain followed by immense happiness and in this journey the blessing of having an amazing doctor is beyond words. \n\nI am literally grateful for her kindness whenever I see her.\n\nI strongly recommend every aspiring pregnant woman to reach out to her (Dr. Sanjida Yasmin, MBBS, DGO, DNB, Senior Consultant, Gynaecologist & Obstetrician, Fellowship in Infertility) for her best guidance throughout your 9 months of pregnancy and even thereafter. ** *** ******* *********** ******* ****** ***** *** ** *** ******************* ************** ****** * ******** *********************** ***** ** *****\n",

We found Dr. Sanjida Yasmin through Google while searching for Best Gynecologist. \n\nWe got her appointment and met her. We followed her during the pregnancy. There were so many ups & downs in my pregnancy so I had contacted her in odd hours too without any hesitation and worry. And she listened my each and every problem politely and handled them gracefully as per the situations. She called me back whenever missed the call. This was my first pregnancy, so I felt nervous many times, She make me calm and provide me mental peace also by talking openly about everything. \n\nWe wanted to have a normal delivery, but was not aware if that could be possible. Many times I asked her about that but Dr. Sanjida never gave me false hopes and make me understand that the only thing I need to do is stay motivated to have a normal delivery and follow her advices. She registered my name in antenatal exercises also. I followed exactly that and finally on 28.07.2023, I had a normal Vaginal delivery. Happy to share that i delivered a healthy baby boy. \n\nThank you for everything you've listened and done for me. I felt very confident and secure in your care. I would like to extend my gratitude towards you for being the most dedicated, calm, carefull, thoughtful, and compassionate doctor. We thank her for all the support and care throughout 9 months and even now.\n\nThank you once again!!!",

Opting for an external ultrasound revealed my problem So I decided to change In search of a solution for a vaginal infection, I decided to consult another doctor. This time was different. She listened patiently, comprehended my issue, and provided advice without judgment. Her friendly and calm demeanor during the consultation was a refreshing change.

                "review_text": "At the outset I would like to state that for the great doctor as Dr.Sanjida Yasmin there are actually no words to write a review and rather as a couple we would like to take this opportunity to extend our gratitude towards her for being the most dedicated, thoughtful, and compassionate doctor that she is! She always goes above and beyond and work tirelessly towards a healthy outcome. We as a couple feel so blessed to know her and have her as our doctor.\u201d\n\nWe have heard so much around pregnancy around us that we were afraid if we will be able to manage that, more specifically when we are not from Delhi and could find Dr.  Sanjida only through Practo and trust us one would not find a gynae as good as her. Initially I was in consultation with some other doctor but there I could not feel the comfort that I required as a first time \u201cMommy to be\u201d but when it comes to Dr. Sanjida the only thing that strikes my mind is that she makes your pregnancy journey so soothing and comforting with her always positive attitude and inspirational words that even the toughest issues seem solvable. The pregnancy experience which she gave me indeed have a lifelong impact on me as I could not have imagined my entire pregnancy journey to be as smooth as she not only said she will make but also made it a reality till my delivery and even thereafter.\n\nWe were too keen to have a normal delivery but was not aware if that could be possible in my case. I remember Dr. Sanjida\u2019s words amply clear that the only thing I need to do is keep my will power strong and stay motivated to have a normal delivery and rest leave it to her and I did exactly that and finally on 07.10.2022 I had a normal delivery and delivered a healthy Baby Boy.  My child is indeed very fortunate to have been born through Dr. Sanjida\u2019s hands. We thank her for all the support and care throughout 9 months and even till now in my postpartum journey. \nShe is outrightly one of most modest person I have known despite being so successful. I love the way she handles all your issues whether medical or financial. One can literally ask her all their queries and she would certainly clarify each of such query without any hesitation. As a doctor I believe the kind words and considerate approach towards issues also solves a lot of problems of the patient and Dr. Sanjida Yasmin has so much patience and literally listens to every word of her patient and I can never thank her enough for her continued undivided attention. \nOut of countless good things about the doctor some of the most prominent ones that I would like to mention are as;\n\uf0a7\tThorough Knowledge about her field with immense experience that will loudly speaks for itself which one will be able to judge at the very first time you will meet her. \n\uf0a7\t24/7 availability for all your issues \n\uf0a7\tCalm, composed and positive attitude towards all problems\n\uf0a7\tOutstanding motivation and guidance in labour room \n\uf0a7\tExtremely focused and dedicated \n\uf0a7\tEncourages queries that the expecting parents might have\n\uf0a7\tStraightforward with patient regarding the issues and challenges but in such a kind and considerate manner to keep the patient comforted and motivated.\n\uf0a7\tTakes care of even the minutest thing from room allotment to staff selection during delivery, financial schemes/offers for expecting mothers from the hospital and even the small events like baby shower organized by hospital for expecting mothers and all these undoubtedly gives one an overall memorable experience \n\nLiterally I can keep writing for hours when it comes to Dr. Sanjida. There are very few people in life who have such high and positive impact on your life and mine has been blessed to have an outstanding experience with Dr. Sanjida Yasmin. As a doctor, she has gone above and beyond everything, I ever would have expected. As a first-time parent, undergoing childbirth is a mix of immense pain followed by immense happiness and in this journey the blessing of having an amazing doctor is beyond words. \n\nI am literally grateful for her kindness whenever I see her.\n\nI strongly recommend every aspiring pregnant woman to reach out to her (Dr. Sanjida Yasmin, MBBS, DGO, DNB, Senior Consultant, Gynaecologist & Obstetrician, Fellowship in Infertility) for her best guidance throughout your 9 months of pregnancy and even thereafter. ** *** ******* *********** ******* ****** ***** *** ** *** ******************* ************** ****** * ******** *********************** ***** ** *****\n",

We found Dr. Sanjida Yasmin through Google while searching for Best Gynecologist. \n\nWe got her appointment and met her. We followed her during the pregnancy. There were so many ups & downs in my pregnancy so I had contacted her in odd hours too without any hesitation and worry. And she listened my each and every problem politely and handled them gracefully as per the situations. She called me back whenever missed the call. This was my first pregnancy, so I felt nervous many times, She make me calm and provide me mental peace also by talking openly about everything. \n\nWe wanted to have a normal delivery, but was not aware if that could be possible. Many times I asked her about that but Dr. Sanjida never gave me false hopes and make me understand that the only thing I need to do is stay motivated to have a normal delivery and follow her advices. She registered my name in antenatal exercises also. I followed exactly that and finally on 28.07.2023, I had a normal Vaginal delivery. Happy to share that i delivered a healthy baby boy. \n\nThank you for everything you've listened and done for me. I felt very confident and secure in your care. I would like to extend my gratitude towards you for being the most dedicated, calm, carefull, thoughtful, and compassionate doctor. We thank her for all the support and care throughout 9 months and even now.\n\nThank you once again!!!",

One, in particular, prescribed costly multivitamins and tests like an ultrasound, which she didn\u2019t perform adequately, claiming everything was normal despite persistent pain\u2026. Opting for an external ultrasound revealed my problem So I decided to change In search of a solution for a vaginal infection, I decided to consult another doctor. This time was different. She listened patiently, comprehended my issue, and provided advice without judgment. Her friendly and calm demeanor during the consultation was a refreshing change. Understanding my problem, she prescribed only what was essential for my problem. I\u2019m grateful for her approach and thankful for the positive experience.",

Her simplicity and ease of working is what we like the best about her. Whether it was a silly question or a serious one she had the same calm face to answer them all. Every pregnancy is different and has its share of highs and lows but what matters is how you sail through it. Her support and explanations made it a smooth journey. She was available round the clock even at the busy hours of the day. She has such an amazing sense of responsibility that sometimes she would herself message and remind us of our scheduled appointments. That shows her dedication and concern towards her patients. I look forward to be in association with her in all the coming times. I am all thankful to her for the love she showers on us leaving behind her own personal life and doing everything selflessly and with a big vibrant smile!",
