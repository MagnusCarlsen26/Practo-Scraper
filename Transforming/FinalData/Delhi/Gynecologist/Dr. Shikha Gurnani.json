She is not just an excellent doctor but also a kind and compassionate HUMAN BEING. From the very beginning, Dr. Gurnani was a guiding light. She meticulously conducted all the necessary tests and explained everything in detail about the changes I could expect. Her approachable and friendly demeanor, coupled with her selfless service and social work, truly set her apart. I always felt comfortable and well-cared for during my visits. \n\nDr. Shikha Gurnani is very polite, genuine, yet very professional. She explains every aspect of the current diagnosis in detail, whether it's positive or negative. Her treatment is effective, and she ensures that her patients receive the best care possible.\n\nWe wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Shikha to every expecting parent. Her patience, empathy, and professionalism make every visit comfortable and reassuring. She takes the time to listen to concerns and provides clear instructions for a healthy pregnancy. We are incredibly grateful for her unwavering support and dedication.\n\nShe gave us a space where we have joked and laughed about anything we felt about with her. \n\nWith a vast experience many doctors lose the human touch in their treatment and that was our biggest concern. And we can say this from bottom of our heart that it's not the case with Dr Shikha. She'll make you feel that it's her responsibility to take good care of your baby and you. \n\nThank you, Dr. Shikha Gurnani, for making our dream of parenthood come true. Our beautiful daughter Twisha is a testament to your expertise and compassion. ",

Dr. Shikha constantly reassured us and kept us informed of what was happening both to my body and emotions. Every step of the way, we knew we were in good hands.\n\nShe made herself very approachable and available to me. Her passionate way of interacting with her patients made us become very faithful in her approach. She is compassionate, thoughtful, dedicated to providing the best patient care. The months leading up to the big day were full of questions and concerns, but we were handled so well by her and answered all our queries with a smile. Her calm demeanor and positive aura helped create a tranquil environment during this once in a lifetime event.\n\nI will always be grateful for the excellent care provided by Dr. Shikha and her entire team at Bloom Vision.\n\nFrom a stress-free delivery to a perfect, quick healing circumcision, the C-section was a great stress free experience.\n\nThank you Ma\u2019am for making this experience a wonderful one! :) We highly recommend Dr. Shikha for her outstanding expertise and patient-centered care.

Your dedication to your patients and your ability to make us feel comfortable and at ease is highly appreciated. I am grateful for the quality of care you provided during my both pregnancies.\nDuring my first pregnancy, I was disappointed and frustrated that another doctor refused to treat me just one week before my delivery. It was a stressful and concerning situation, and I was left in a vulnerable position with a critical need for medical care with high BP. Your willingness to step in and provide me with the necessary treatment and support during such a crucial time was truly appreciated. Your willingness to accept and take on this responsibility at such short notice speaks volumes about your dedication to patients and commitment to delivering quality healthcare. Thank you for your prompt and compassionate care when I needed it most.\n I would highly recommend you to others in need of a gynecologist for pregnancy and childbirth. Thank you for your outstanding care.",

She is not just an excellent doctor but also a kind and compassionate HUMAN BEING. From the very beginning, Dr. Gurnani was a guiding light. She meticulously conducted all the necessary tests and explained everything in detail about the changes I could expect. Her approachable and friendly demeanor, coupled with her selfless service and social work, truly set her apart. I always felt comfortable and well-cared for during my visits. \n\nDr. Shikha Gurnani is very polite, genuine, yet very professional. She explains every aspect of the current diagnosis in detail, whether it's positive or negative. Her treatment is effective, and she ensures that her patients receive the best care possible.\n\nWe wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Shikha to every expecting parent. Her patience, empathy, and professionalism make every visit comfortable and reassuring. She takes the time to listen to concerns and provides clear instructions for a healthy pregnancy. We are incredibly grateful for her unwavering support and dedication.\n\nShe gave us a space where we have joked and laughed about anything we felt about with her. \n\nWith a vast experience many doctors lose the human touch in their treatment and that was our biggest concern. And we can say this from bottom of our heart that it's not the case with Dr Shikha. She'll make you feel that it's her responsibility to take good care of your baby and you. \n\nThank you, Dr. Shikha Gurnani, for making our dream of parenthood come true. Our beautiful daughter Twisha is a testament to your expertise and compassion. ",

Her attentive approach and clear communication made me feel comfortable discussing sensitive health matters. Dr. Shikha addressed all my concerns with professionalism and compassion, ensuring I felt heard and understood. \n\nSince this was our first child, we were unaware of what we were getting into. Dr. Shikha constantly reassured us and kept us informed of what was happening both to my body and emotions. Every step of the way, we knew we were in good hands.\n\nShe made herself very approachable and available to me. Her passionate way of interacting with her patients made us become very faithful in her approach. She is compassionate, thoughtful, dedicated to providing the best patient care. The months leading up to the big day were full of questions and concerns, but we were handled so well by her and answered all our queries with a smile. Her calm demeanor and positive aura helped create a tranquil environment during this once in a lifetime event.\n\nI will always be grateful for the excellent care provided by Dr. Shikha and her entire team at Bloom Vision.\n\nFrom a stress-free delivery to a perfect, quick healing circumcision, the C-section was a great stress free experience.\n\nThank you Ma\u2019am for making this experience a wonderful one! :) We highly recommend Dr. Shikha for her outstanding expertise and patient-centered care. A definite five-star experience. \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\nWith love n regards\n\nGreeshma & Anish\n",

I am grateful for the quality of care you provided during my both pregnancies.\nDuring my first pregnancy, I was disappointed and frustrated that another doctor refused to treat me just one week before my delivery. It was a stressful and concerning situation, and I was left in a vulnerable position with a critical need for medical care with high BP. Your willingness to step in and provide me with the necessary treatment and support during such a crucial time was truly appreciated. Your willingness to accept and take on this responsibility at such short notice speaks volumes about your dedication to patients and commitment to delivering quality healthcare. Thank you for your prompt and compassionate care when I needed it most.\n I would highly recommend you to others in need of a gynecologist for pregnancy and childbirth.

From my first visit to her clinic while planning my first pregnancy to now having two kids, she has always shown warmth and professionalism. \n\nDuring my first pregnancy, I was often worried and unsure about what to expect, but Dr. Shikha's reassuring words always calmed me. She took the time to listen carefully to my concerns and explained everything clearly. Her deep ********* *** experience gave me confidence that I was in good hands during both my normal and caesarean delivery.\n\nI am very thankful to Dr. Shikha for being with me through both pregnancies. I truly appreciate her exceptional care and highly recommend her to all women.\n-Monika",

I can tell you that I didn't feel its my first visit, the staff was very courteous but i was concerned about the doctor considering my past experiences with other doctors who were rude and arrogant.  But doctor removed all my preconceived notions and welcomed us as she knew us before. \nDoctor started the treatment but unfortunately our baby couldn't survive more that 1.5 months and my wife went under D&C. I thought that Doctor like others will not be bothered about our loss but she tried to console us like a mother.\n\nSecond Year_Dec 2018\n\nAfter the first miscarriage, we planned again in 2018 and visited the doctor. I was surprised to see that not only the staff but doctor knew our names even after 2 years. Doctor was happier than us to see us once again and she started the treatment once again but unfortunately our baby didint survive again after 1.5 months from the conception.  Doctor was also surprised with that but you cannot change whats written in your destiny.  Even in that situation i didnt lose my trust on doctor and left everything to her for further treatment whereas if it could have been other patient then they could have blamed the doctor.\n\nThird Year_July 2019\n\nAfter the completion of healing period we visited the \"same\" doctor once again in July 2019 for the treatment. I still remember the conversation, Doctor said \"I will not leave any stone unturned and will apply whatever i have learned to make you proud parents but you need to trust me\" and I replied \" I wont be standing here with my wife once again, I have immense trust in you\". Doctor advised us some tests & medicines and started the treatment. During the course of the treatment, Doctor used to advise and guide us like a mother not as a doctor. She was available for us all the time (but we didnt took advantage of that and didnt disturb her in nights and weekends unless its urgent and critical). Even this pregnancy was not a cake walk for us but doctor held our hands and walked with us throughout the pregnancy. There were high chances of caesarean but doctor was pushing for normal delivery and i was astonished when my wife delivered the baby girl in the night of 31st March through normal delivery. \n\nI cannot pay back ever to the doctor what she has done for us, Doctor came like a guardian angel in our life who filled our life with everlasting happiness. I can keep on writing but it will not be enough.",

That\u2019s what often people say, but they are wrong. \nThe day one gets to know that they have conceived is when the journey of parenthood begins.\nWe were early birds \ud83d\ude01... figured it out in the 3rd week that we had conceived. Being proactive I had shortlisted a few and finalized onto one particular doctor basis on the reviews, rating, experience from Practo before hand.  So we rushed with the pregnancy kit test to her. \nA calm and composed, yet chirpy doctor on the other side... she had her mask on, but from her eyes I could read that she had a wide smile. She said that it looks that you have passed but let\u2019s run some tests and be sure. That\u2019s my baby\u2019s first date with doctor Gurnani. \nIn those 9 months I went through a lot - not being able to gain weight initially, a bit of complications in the ultra sound, a small car accident and got infected with Coronavirus \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\nBeing from hospitality I was working 14 hours - traveling 60kms - and constantly on my feet - parents in a different city. The reason I am sharing all this is because I want you to understand what kind of support I got from her. \nThere are times I would msg her with silly questions, would rush  into the clinic with serious issues and a lot more...but there was not a single time I gave a second thought about considering someone else. My husband would make fun of me, that I often found reasons to meet her as it was comforting. May be it was true.\nI wanted a normal delivery. She had recommended to stay active without stressing and I chose to work till the last month and one day I was at work and wasn\u2019t sure if I was in labor so I messaged her and rushed once she confirmed.\nA samosa, a plate of chowmein and a few hours later - I had my angel in my arms.\nNormal delivery - few extra stitches (as my body wasn\u2019t ready cos it was bit ahead of EDD) but no one else could have made that moment so beautiful for me. As she was stitching me up and scolding me like a momma ... I laughed and said - u can\u2019t get irritated - m gonna come back in a  few years for the next one. \nFor me to say that on the table, at that point - you can understand what kind of trust she must have instilled in me. \nMy husband and I are both chefs and in our words - like a perfect chef, she got the bun out of the oven, just right in time\nNot to forget, there is pinky at the reception - she is a saviour when you need last minute help with getting an appointment on a busy day.\nLoads of love\nTo Dr. Gurnani & BloomVision Family\nFrom\nPrerna, Sachin & Puchku (baby Neera)",

We came to know about Dr. Shikha Gurnani through one of our friend. Then we search out on practo. After reading so many positive reviews we decided to approach shikha mam for our first pregnancy in 2018. After meeting her we found her very straight forward and strict. She explained everything in detail and answered all my questions and cleared my all doubts. My pregnancy was natural and healthy. All my reports were normal.  But at 33 week I lost my child due to chord around her neck in the stomach only. I was devastated and broken. Because she approached for a normal delivery we waited for  3 days but due to hard luck we moved to c-sec. I thought I would never going to have a child. There must be some medical problem with me. But at that point of time Shikha mam supported me a lot. She promised me that you are going to have your baby in one year. I still remembered her words \" tera baccha toh me hi karungi,\" and dont know how .... i got a ray of hope. She advised me to take one year gap due to c sec. But actual struggle started now. Suddenly I started to gain weight. After 5 months of operation I visited her clinic again and she advised me to take some tests. Then we found some medical problem with me. And now before thinking about pregnancy we need to settle down my medical condition. I followed her instructions and contact to the  specialist suggested by her only. And guess what in only 2 months my health was  in control. Then after waiting for 2 more months we decided to conceive again. In January 2020 I conceived again by the grace of God. And decided to consult her only. In my 2nd pregnancy she took all the precautions she can. Due to my first pregnancy experience & this pandemic of corona,I was also very much scared. She guided me whenever I had any doubt or problem even on phone / WhatsApp.  She has lovely combination of professionalism and care. She never gave up on me, even when I had doubt about my pregnancy. One of the best doctor and person we have ever met. Her positive approach & beautiful smile made everything easy. She kept her promise  Due to her continuous efforts and by the Grace of god we are blessed with  a healthy baby boy. I would highly recommend Dr Shikha for those who are waiting for their bundle of joy. A doctor like you is the one behind so many smiles....thank you for giving others the confidence to smile with sparkle...\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70Saying thankyou is not enough....no words mam....you made our life beautiful amazing doctor and person you areif someone really need a trust worthy doctor then choose shikha mam only. May god give u all the happiness and success in your life. Thank you once again mam from Neelam, Ravi & Avi",

                "review_text": "First apologies for posting this too late, But I feel Dr. Shikha Gurnani deserves to be reviewed as the dedication & oneness she gives to her patients is really commendable. \nThis is after 11 years of our marriage we took decision to have second baby as we were already blessed with 10 year old son. We approached a female gynecologist (don't want to mention her name) with which we had a very negative and bad experience of life. Due to non-co-operation& handling the case lightly my wife went thru a great trauma.\n Again after a year we decided to take another chance for second baby, then we decided to search on practo for the same and find a suitable doctor for my wife treatment and course. We searched for good gynecologist in Dwarka. Dr. Shikha has 97% recommendations & positive reviews and we were surprised to see such a high positive feedback. We also saw 100% reviews for other doctors but the no. of reviewers were too less as compared to Dr. Shikha. \nJust at our first appointment with her we were happy & satisfied that yes Dr. Shikha will be good mentor & friend for my wife who had already faced so much trauma a year back. She is such an amazing doctor & individual, she built confidence in our mind that my wife can deliver even at the age of 39 years.\nShe also guided us the genetic problems as this age a woman can have, so with her advice we went for genetic test and result was very satisfying. At first we were in great fear of this test but the way she guided was so awesome that all went well.  We were so comfortable while talking to her and she always explained everything in a positive manner. We also discussed a problem of my wife which she had after her first delivery 10 years ago, she took is so calmly and tell us don\u2019t to worry as she will be operating that vein also which causes problem during her mensuration time. \nFinally the day came when i took my wife to  Venkateshwar hospital because she was feeling a severe pain and even at 7 AM in morning i called up doctor and asked for suggestion , she immediately told me don\u2019t to worry and take her to hospital as she will be guiding the staff there for further check processes . We reached hospital around 8 AM & found that she already instructed the staff and doctor on duty. My wife was so much in pain but she told doctor to wait for our elder son to back from school as he wished to be present at the time of baby birth for which she handled the situation so beautifully and managed to agree her for immediate C-Section.\nI can still remember that moment when Dr. Shikha came out from labor room and congratulates me for been blessed with a Baby Girl (that is what we wished for). I had tear in my eyes & It was like a dream come true after seeing my little baby girl. Our world is filled with joy forever. She also handled the post-delivery complication which my wife faced in last delivery. \nIt would not have been possible without the Dr. Shikha's utmost dedication, due diligence and professional attitude in the complete process. Another praise-worthy initiative is that she requests every parent after the delivery to plant a tree in the name of the new born baby (which is still pending from my side). We are very grateful & thankful to Dr Shikha Gurnani for the wonderful journey. \n",

She is no less than \u201cA Living God\u201d for us. I can\u2019t explain more in words that how the hope and love Shikha Ma\u2019am showered on us.Our journey with her started like this \u2013 I was diagnosed and operated with myomectomy twice within a short span of 4 years. My second myomectomy was a nightmare though it was performed by a reputed doctor in a renowned hospital.\u00a0We thought of planning for our second baby after one year of my surgery. We visited a famous gynaecologist for pre-natal consultation. She straight away sent us for IVF. We somehow couldn\u2019t make up our minds for IVF; hence we thought of going the natural way and visited Dr. Shikha as I have already heard so many positive responses about her.I would like to name it as miracle or destiny as in our 2nd\u00a0visit to Shikha ma\u2019am, we were confirmed with positive result of pregnancy. She then consulted me with utmost empathy and prepared us mentally for the wonderful nine months journey of pregnancy.Each time we visited her, we used to come out of her clinic with happy faces and confidence in hearts **** ** *** ** *** ***** ****** **** ********** ********* ** ** ******** *** ****** **** we feel safe with her. She used to clarify all my serious / silly queries with patience. I always look forward to her routine check-ups as meeting her is such a pleasant experience altogether. She arranges pre-natal class which was very informative.I had issues with high BP throughout my pregnancy. Ma\u2019am managed this serious condition so smoothly and without giving us any anxiety which she used to take on behalf of us without even showing it to us. She makes situations so normal with her humorous nature and at the same time keeps strict check on the patients whenever necessary, which is so amazing and unique quality of her.Finally, I had caesarean in first week of October, which was a high risk surgery, but I didn\u2019t feel it even for a single moment, except for written in the medical reports. I was apprehensive this time because of my past experience with myomectomy surgery, but the surgery was so smooth and painless that I was on my feet walking comfortably from day 3rd\u00a0morning itself.Her always smiling face and excellent counseling qualities did wonders in our pregnancy and after delivery recovery as well.Here I would like to mention one more quality which is so unique about Shikha Ma\u2019am. Her \u201cpersonal touch\u201d with the patients does magic in the healing process. Our baby was admitted in the NICU for few days. She used to continuously take updates from the concerned pediatrician and share the same with us. Till the time baby came home, she was continuously in touch with the pediatrician as well as with us. I wonder if these level of \u201cpersonal connection\u201d any other gynaecologist share with their patients.Another praise-worthy matter is that she requests every patient after the delivery to plant a tree in the name of the new born baby. This unique initiative has touched our hearts very much. In nutshell she is a gem of a person.Shikha ma\u2019am, last but certainly not the least, we would like to \u201cThank you\u201d for all the guidance, counseling, support and everything you did for us and you are still these doing for us.\u00a0Because of Shikha ma\u2019am, today we have the most precious gift, our baby, with us. She is not only a doctor; she is a friend, guide and mentor for life.We would like to recommend her to each and everyone who seeks gynaecology and obstetrician care.Thanks You \u201cPracto\u201d for giving us the opportunity to connect to such a lovely and amazing doctor and human being \u2013 Dr. Shikha Gurnani.With lots of love and best wishesBandana and Prachurjya",

She helped me throughout my pregnancy and supported me to get a normal vaginal delivery despite my broken Ankle.\n\nDuring my pregnancy, your proactive approach to monitoring both my baby's health and mine ensured that any issues were promptly identified and addressed. She was available over the phone as well in case of any concern/problem.\n\nDespite the inevitable challenges that arise during my delivery, her methods go beyond medical excellence. Because of her positive approach and support, I was able to deliver a healthy baby vaginally.  I felt supported and secure under her care, and for that, I am profoundly grateful.\n\n I would like to specially mention the emotional quotient developed with her. I will be forever indebted to her for supporting me throughout my journey.  I highly recommend Dr Shikha to expecting mothers.\n\nThanks,\nVandana, Ashish, and (little) Shubh\ud83d\udc95\n\n",

Throughout our journey she was there with us and due to her efforts only everything culminated on an exceptional note. She explained everything with minute details and always enforced positiveness. My wife started to have increased blood pressure at the final phase of the pregnancy but she treated her as per need instead of any extraneous medications. We had a normal delivery due to her efforts only. We would whole heartedly recommend her to any expecting parents without an iota of doubt. Thank you so much again Shikha ma'am \ud83d\ude0a. We don't have enough words to express our gratitude.",

We were going through Practo reviews and came to know about Dr. Shikha Gurnani. \n\nHer reviews on Practo were very positive which made us little skeptical about the genuineness of her reviews. Still we took the appointment and went to Genesis to meet her. We talked to many of her patients sitting outside in the waiting area about their overall experience with the doctor. They all were very happy and satisfied. We got little relief hearing the reviews directly from her patients rather relying only on Practo.\n\nWhen we met her on our first appointment at Genesis, she was very polite, down to earth yet caring and experience. We always wanted to have Normal Delivery and she always supported and motivated us for the same. She guided us very well and my wife followed all her instructions to have normal delivery. She is always available  on call or what's app for help and support. Now we are proud parents as my wife delivered a baby boy via Normal Delivery at Venkateshwar Hospital, Dwarka.\n\nLong Story Short -  It has been an amazing journey with Dr Shikha. She's a great doctor one can wish for.  She is personable, friendly, calm, and an absolute joy to talk to. she will make you feel like home and comfortable to tell your problems easily. She's a perfect combination of professional doctor and a good friend.\n\nGoing through childbirth is a mix of immense pain followed by immense happiness. In this journey, the presence of a wonderful doctor like you is simply priceless. Thanks doctor, for comforting my wife and taking away all her stress.\n\nWe would like to 'highly highly highly' recommend Dr. Shikha to all expecting parents who are looking for a trustworthy and experience doctor. \n\nLots of love to Dr. Shikha :)\n\nRegards,\nSonali, Jatin and little Taarush.",

We had consulted a number of doctors for last couple of years in Delhi and particularly in Dwarka before approaching Dr. Shikha. Unfortunately none of the other doctors were able to diagnose the root cause behind my issues. Getting pregnant seemed impossible at one point of time and we had almost lost hope , but thank God for sending Dr. Shikha into our lives who thoroughly understood my case and with her efforts I conceived just after a month of consulting her. *** ** ***** ** *****, in fact a messenger of God for us as she has helped us in having the most precious gift of our life.\n\nShe is not only excellent professionally, on a personal front also she is equally amazing. On our very first encounter, she made us feel at home. Her smiling face, helpful attitude, determination and dedication creates a positive ambience. We used to call Dr. Shikha for some of our silliest queries as well and  she would always happily answer our calls and provide immediate resolution without any delay. *** ** *** **** ** ***** *******\nWe contacted Dr. Shikha after reading her reviews on Practo. Our first thought was can we actually rely on these reviews , and now here I am writing this review for her from the soul of my heart so that people who are actually in need can make the right decision. The point is, this review is not for Dr. Shikha, but for all those women out there who are struggling with any kind of gynaec issues* *** ****** ** *** **** *** ** ** ********* ******* *** ****** We are going to remain in debt to her all our life. God Bless her always.",

She is not just a Doctor, she treat as your family member and you feel comfortable in her clinic as your home.  \n\nI have been in touch with her since last 2 years. In spite of having Thyroid and other complication, she treated me and I blessed with a baby for the 2nd time.  In case of my 1st baby, after CS, I am unable to walk properly even after 20 days. However in case of Dr. Shikha, I am able to walk after 3-4 days. We are happy now as a parents and she made my 9 months of pregnancy very smooth. \n\nI visited 2-3 doctors before Dr. Shikha but was not satisfied due to various reasons, like money minded, time constraint, deal with casually, and most of the times the doctors were in so much hurry that our queries remained unanswered. Finally by the reference of a friend, I met to Dr. Shikha. And I am glad we approached her. She never made me feel that I am a new patient to her. She was very frank and friendly to me and made me very comfortable on the very first visit. *** **** *** ** ** ****** *** ******* ************* she is also a wonderful person. What sets her apart is her humane side. Unlike a few medical practitioners I have encountered in past. Dr. Shikha treats her patients as people and not cases or files. Extremely approachable and sensitive to patient's needs. Her compassion and commitment to patients is like nothing I've received before.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, I thanks a million to this amazing person! And recommended Dr. Shikha ** *** **** ************* \n",

It was just been three days that me and husband before leaving for honeymoon wanted to know more about the family planning. She was amazed and complimented us for our pro approach. Since then I have been in touch with Dr. Shikha. On Aug 2017 I got to know that I was pregnant. My immediate attention was to approach Dr. Shikha. I was much relieved with her advise. She is friendly and professional. Even the doctor attendant was calm. Indeed there was rush of patients but she never loses her calm. Our faith grew more when my mother in law and mother went to meet her. Instantly their faith in her was quite appreciative.\nThe 09 months pregnancy was a interestingly bit inconvenient but joyful phase. Her medicines and health advise were appropriate. Though I was lean and unable to put on required weight. She motivated me enough through different means. Sometimes happily sometimes like a strict teacher :) Her only suggestion to me was to have a normal delivery for which I was so scared. Her confidence and ability to create a positive mind set let me to go for normal delivery. \nBy the time I came to my 08 months she suggested me to do exercises. I was all time working professional. On generic regular follow check up day on 17th March, she did examine me and wished me good luck for a happy news. \nVoila !! I was in labour on the same evening and went to Hospital. By 10pm I was admitted and within an hour I was blessed with a baby girl. \nDr. Shikha has been extremely honest, approachable and sincere in her profession. I am grateful that I could find her well in time. My family and me all are happy with her. For sure she needs to be recognised and referred to. \n\nThank you Dr. Shikha\n\nBest regards \nNeha Sharma Yadav",

She told me the exact situation of my hormonal issues without giving any wrong expectations. Though I was aware of my pcod and bad hormonal levels already. So it was a major concern for me that how much time it will take to resolve my issue. I planned my pregnancy after 5 years of my marriage and have a fear in my mind somewhere that people comments should not be true that in starting you are not planning and later you will be too late to conceive. But as I was not ready mentally and physically so I took risk of planning late . But when I made a decision to conceive, it was really hard to wait and made me worried. As I have wasted 1 year on homeopathic treatment for pcod and it made my pcod more worse than any improvement. So I choose Dr. Shikha after reading positive reviews on practo... And I found her exactly lucky doctor for me. She helped me to conceive within 6 months. With my bad levels of hormones, 6 months is not long time as there were possibilities of more time. I was really worried whether I will conceive or not after listening my friends stories of pcod and there conceiving time. But I conceived in 1st month of trying after getting my hormones balanced under the proper guidance of Dr. Shikha for 6 months. I can proudly say that miracle happens when you and Dr. both have trust and patience \ud83d\ude0a I had instances of pain in my lower abdomen and sebaceous cysts during my pregnancy. But my pregnancy journey got smooth under proper supervision of Dr. Shikha and I delivered a healthy baby last week. Thank you so much Dr. Shikha for everything! Always be happy and healthy!",

Right from our very first visit back in 2017 and this year 2021, we were very happy to have chosen Shikha Mam for our care. The right amount of information at the right amount of time kept us at ease and relaxed, which was very important to us. No unwanted tests, no scares etc. Just the required tests and visits to make sure mom and baby were doing well. Very modern and up-to-date practices made the whole experience enjoyable. When it came to delivery of both my babies, the combined care of Shikha Mam and her staff at hospital made my delivery process smooth and that too a normal delivery even though I had some complications in my first delivery. We could not have asked for more. I would also like to mention again the excellent quality of caring nature of her staff and nurses. Overall, a great experience, we feel lucky to have her as our gynecologist because I don't think that you can find anyone better than her in Delhi or infact in entire India. If any one of you who is looking for a trusted and intelligent doctor for pregnancy journey then don't think much and visit her clinic and be in safe hands. I can write 100 pages for her and won't be tired to express my gratitude towards her. Lots of love Mam, Keep delivering happiness in everyone's life as you have given me the best gift of my life Kanishk and Nitya . God bless you and your Family :)\n\nFrom Minakshi & Jagat",

It's not that other two doctors i went to were bad but Dr. shikha's friendly and calm nature made me feel very comfortable. Her way of explaining everything and making sure that you understand her treatment is something you don't find in many doctors these days. And no matter how late it is or how many patient she have, she will always give proper time and listen to your every question and answer them. she didn't recommend any unnecessary tests and when I told her that I want a normal delivery she was more than supportive of that. Although she didn't make any promises and would tell me everything clearly. I was always looking forward to Meeting her, because she would put my mind to ease with her suggestions and treatment. I  normally delivered  a healthy baby girl on 20th December with her help in the morning all because as soon as she came to know I was in labor and in the hospital she came running, that's how much she is dedicated for her patients and would recommend everyone to consult her and you can blindly trust her. For me she is an angel and my permanent gynecologist. And the staff is also supper nice in her clinic. The clinic is clean and hygienic. Dr. shikha is very gentle and always smiling. I can go on and on about how great she is but truly if you are looking for an ob/gyn, she is the one you should go to. And to Dr. shikha, thank you so much for your guidance and support throughout this journey and bringing my beautiful daughter into this world. It couldn't have been easy without you so thank you and I wish you all the best for your future. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc95",

Her ability to communicate well and explain difficult topics in a simple and understanding manner is highly commendable and as a male partner I did not have any hesitation to be approachable to her which helped me to support my partner in the best way possible. \n\nSecondly her clinic is very organised in terms of literature charts and other multiple things and she has ensured her support staff is well trained and explain things in a very easy manner which becomes very easy to handle.\n\nThirdly her friendliness and approachability will help you and your partner to ensure the entire journey of pregnancy remains memorable. At the end of the day what matters is how the journey of the 9 months are and the many good memories that are gathered during this time and she ensures it\u2019s done in a very efficient manner.\n\nWe were blessed with a baby boy and all thankful to her to ensure our journey is a memorable and happy one. We will always remain thankful and blessed to find a doctor of such high caliber and knowledge to always remain indebted to her.\n\nThank you Dr Shikha for being such a nice human first and then the doctor.\n\n\nLove and regards\n\nPriyanshu, Jitesh & Vayu (our little one)",

After first appointment with her we realized that We can not move forward with her as she was not approachable and extremely busy. \n\nWe again starting searching for a good Gynecologist and our search landed at Dr Shikha Gurnani Clinic through Practo. Some time the reviews created doubt in mind how a doctor can have 97% positive feedbacks. But after meeting with her first time she built confidence in our mind that my wife can deliver normally even at the age of 37 years. \n\nIn each pregenancy check-up she was becoming more of a friend than doctor. We were so comfortable while talking to her that we shared every single point with her which she explained in positive manner. We already told her that my wife had PPH in last delivery. Her best part was that she always encouraged my wife for NVD and warned her if my wife missed any instruction she gave in last visit. Some of the warnings are soft and some are very strict (like a good teacher). We were very happy to have a good Gynecologist but the best part of the doctor was yet to come.\n\nIn the last visit before pregnancy she wishes us luck for the delivery and next day my wife came into labour. We went to Venkateshwar hospital next day morning at 10 am after talking to her. She already talked to the on-duty doctor and instructed them before we reached there. Every thing was very slow before she entered into the hospital. She changed the picture just after entering the labour room. My wife was so much exhausted and told doctor for C-section. But it was the doctor who motivated my wife to put all the energy and not to loose confidence. She left no stone unturned to get the normal delivery and succeeded.\n\nI can still remember her voice (PUSH PUSH.... :) ) which was coming out from Labour room. She also handled the post delivery complication which my wife faced in last delivery. It was like a dream come true after hearing first cry of the baby.\n\nWe are very grateful to Dr Shikha Gurnani for the wonderful journey. It wouldn't be easy without you and your support. Thanks for the motivation you gave throughout the journey. \n\nThank you so much Doctor!!!!\n\nRegards,\nRohit & Dolly\n",

Please Note : She is not a Doctor, she will turn as your family member and within the first visit you will feel comfortable and at home in her clinic.  \r\n\r\nI visited 2 doctors before Shikha but was not satisfied due to various reasons, like money minded doctors, Time constraint discussion, and most of the times the doctors were in so much hurry that our queries remained unanswered.  500 Rupees and 2 to 3 mins talk and that too with too much professionalism. \r\n\r\nThe first visit to Dr. Shikha happened after reading some review over Practo.  The first visit gave us a positive vibes that we have reached the right place and with the time it turned to a relation.  She is too strong in her field.  I have been blessed with a Baby Girl and I thank her again and again for the normal delivery she supported my wife with.\r\n\r\nThere was one moment at the Labor hour that my wife with pain requested for a C-SEC, but Dr. Shikha with positive aggression made my wife confident and strong to get it to Normal Delivery. \r\n\r\nI still remember when Dr. Shikha entered the room and she got a call from a patient, she said to the caller \u201c I am doing a delivery and will be free in one hour\u201d.  I looked at my wife and said \u201cOne Hour, seriously\u201d.  And what truth exactly after one hour I touched my daughters feet.\r\n\r\nTo Everyone \u201cGo blindly to her, you will be in right hands\u201d.  They say \u201cDoctor is next to God\u201d and Yes with Dr. Shikha me and my wife felt it.\r\n\r\nThank you Dr. Shikha for supporting this lifetime event.  \r\n\r\nKritika and Tarun Madan\r\n",

I had my first baby under her guidance 4.5 years ago. I consulted her for my 2nd pregnancy and even after 4.5 years, she remembered every minute details of my first pregnancy. She made us so comfortable that we could ask her all our queries be it silly or anything without any hesitation. Due to her friendliness and humorous nature, we used to look forward to appointments with her as all the anxieties I had during pregnancy vanished after meeting her. We were very particular about normal delivery and I can say without an iota of doubt that normal delivery was possible in both my pregnancies solely because of Shikha ma'am. She keeps checking on her patients personally during labour pain, I witnessed this not only in my case but all the patients who were admitted with me. She made my labour pains and delivery seem so easy which any women can vouch can never be easy but with Shikha ma'am even that is possible. Thank you so much Shikha ma'am for all your support and guidance, we will forever be grateful to you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

Every time I visited the clinic she heard all my concerns even when they were pretty obvious for a pregnant woman. \nDuring throughout journey she given me right advises regarding my diet and weight control.\nShe prescribed only those medicines which were suitable for my situation.\nShe even adjusted with our choice of hospital selection which was last on her preference list.\nFinally our wish of 2nd child fulfilled under her supervision and we are now parent of a baby girl.\nNeedless to mention I am consulting her for my post pregnancy care.\nThank You so much Dr. Shikha again.",

Despite informing the doctor that I had done a pregnancy test a week ago, she insisted in doing it again as she was confident it was pregnancy related. It turned out to be precise and I was very glad and relieved to know the result.\n\nThe way the doctor instilled the confidence was amazing and I continued with her throughout my pregnancy. I felt the best part about her is that she is a good listener, devoted considerably good time with her patients and guides them well. She can handle complications well by virtue of her experience and neither shows any panic nor allows her patients to get panicked. Not only till delivery but her guidance even post-delivery is highly appreciable.\n\nShe is a part of 2-3 hospitals as of now (hope more and more added to her basket) and is always on her toes taking care of any emergencies irrespective of time.  \n\nI would definitely recommend her as a preferred choice for all the women.",

She is very thorough in her diagnosis and is not orthodox in her approach and judgement giving the much needed support the patients want. \n\nThe best thing about her is she can be tough if she sees you are doing something that is not right for mother or baby but deep inside it is the love and care for you that makes her do that and joins you in your happiness. \n\nShe is experienced, approachable and always there for her patients with her magical smile. If you're searching for a gynecologist in Dwarka or nearby, I would strongly recommend her.\n\nAll the best Shikha Ma\u2019am! :)\n\nAmrita & Ajay \n",

Earlier we were having a daughter who was born in 2014 after many complications. Since then we had been planning for our second child but were unable to do so because of certain pregnancy issues. From our very first meeting, my husband and I both sensed an ease with Dr. Shikha's approach; she was very methodical in every step and explained the reasons on every decision to be made. Even after every hurdle we encountered, she held our hands every step of the way, and gave us confidence that we will eventually become parents again. Her positive and genuine approach made me feel no longer a patient, but a part of her family. Now, fast forward six years later...our home is finally filled with the joy and laughter of a baby boy. Now my family is complete. \nSo, what words come to mind to describe Dr. Shikha and the exceptional care I received from her? Genuine kindness, trustworthy, passionate, lifelong friend, and most importantly, my guardian angel.\"\nThanks alot Dr. Shikha.  It wouldn't have been possible without you. ",

Thanks Practo!\nDoctor was really friendly & humble and at same time she was very professional & straight forward.\nMy wife was pregnant with twins & our main concern was to take the pregnancy to 9th month which is not so easy now days as twins are usually born pre-term - from 28 to 35 weeks (7th or 8th month) & then require special neonatal care. Doctor was also concerned for the same & guided us so well regarding each & everything whether it is medicines, vaccinations, activities or diet..she was so caring.\n\nFinally, by the grace of god we reached to 9th month though it was tough for my wife but she managed and now we are more than happy to share that we have been blessed with baby girl & boy. Our world is filled with joy forever.\nIt would not have been possible without the doctor's utmost dedication, due diligence and professional attitude in the complete process.\nI Would definitely like to thank and recommend her.\n\"The best visit to a gynecologist till date\"\nThanks!\nBest Regards\nApti & Dheeraj Arora",

I feel myself fortunate and thank god that I got treated from her. Although it was my first pregnancy but I never felt any stress or loose confidence during my pregnancy due to her proper guidance and valuable suggestions. I can't forget the effort she put during my delivery. She left no stone unturned to get me normal delivery by carefully keeping all risk factors due to nuchal cord.

In our first consultation she patiently answered all my doubts since this was my first pregnancy. She explained purpose of all the tests (ultrasound, screening etc) and also shared her diagnosis of the test-reports. This helps the patients (specially first-timers like me) get a lot of comfort and confidence. If you are a person who prefer hand-holding throughout your pregnancy, then you can certainly trust Shikha Ma'm ** *** *****\nThe best thing about Shikha Ma'am is that she is so friendly and establishes a very good relationship with her patients. I always wanted to have a normal delivery and Dr Shikha fully supported me throughout the journey. Thanks to her, I delivered a healthy baby normally (without C-section). Dr Shikha is always accessible to the patients as the need arises.\nI will most definitely recommend her to everyone ** ***** *** ** *** **** ************* * **** **** ******* May God bless you Shikha Ma'am!!\n\nAlso a big thanks to the helpful staff at Bloom Clinic :)",

A very pleasant, friendly and accessible doctor that she is, it immensely helped that I and my husband were under her guidance through that crucial phase of our lives that included dealing with multiple physical, emotional changes. With her calm and ever smiling demeanour she would listen to every little detail or doubt I had in my mind and very patiently offer her set of advises. On many occassions, we would call/ message her to seek her suggestion for some problem or the other and she always responded positively. She helped me deliver a healthy baby boy two weeks back and even though it was a c- sec, I managed to ride through it without much difficulty- thanks to the trust Dr Shikha had generated in me. I am happy I went to her based on the reviews on Practo and relied on my instinct. I recommend her strongly to all would-be/ planning- to- be mothers in and around Dwarka.    ",

We went to Shikha in middle of pregnancy and also of the pandemic solely based on practos reviews. Our doubt was cleared in first appointment itself!! She guided us very well throughout the pregnancy for normal delivery. We did as she advised. Unfortunately for us I was asymptotic covid Positive just before delivery still she didn't  refused us and normally delivered our baby boy with single loop around his neck. She went out of way to help us secure bed in covid ward as we were refused by hospital due to covid bed unavailability ,even after we have booked 2 months before for the delivery. We are very thankful to her for guidance and help.. We definitely recommend Dr. Shikha to our friends and family. She is the best gynae ( and a friend)  one can have during her pregnancy.. :)",

We visited her for our first pregnancy after being referred to her by a friend. She is very straightforward and explains everything to the point. I went into labor in 35 weeks. I was 3.5cm dilated with minimal pains. But suddenly the baby's heartbeat dropped to 50. I was being taken to OT for a CS because of severe fetal distress. I could feel the doctor herself was not happy for CS. When we reached OT, the baby's heartbeat was back to normal. She suggested we wait for another contraction in OT . Though the OT people were really ready to go for CS. She really tried and with her trials, within 2 hours I had normal delivery. I can say if there would have been any other doctor, we would not have  returned back from OT without a CS. Its because of her determination the normal delivery was possible. Our entire journey of pregnancy has been truly amazing with her. We are really thankful for her dedication. Wishing her all the best!!",

Dr. Shikha was helpful in identifying the probable causes. She assessed immediate requirements including age related management for the expectant mother. The medication prescribed along with advise related to supportive management including diet, rest, lifestyle changes etc. helped ensuring the subsequent scans gradually improved resulting in a healthy pregnancy. She continued to ensure relevant scans and medical tests were conducted at right times to cover all necessary risk profiles. Though there was still a bit of complication right at the end of pregnancy, however, she managed the same pretty well. She extended all the necessary support post delivery as well. Our child had to undergo an observation period due to some post delivery complications, however, Dr. Shikha continued to ensure we had all the awareness of the management treatment though this was not her direct responsibility.\n\nWe are really happy with the friendliness and overall support provided by Dr. Shikha Gurnani.",

After meeting for the first time, we did not even think of consulting another gynaecologist because she explained everything very clearly with a positive approach. She is very active, understanding and listen to all our queries very carefully and calmly always with a smile on her face. She always guided us with actual scenario and we also trusted her and simply followed each and every advise given by her throughout my pregnancy.  She gives proper time to all the patients regardless of the queue of patients at clinic. The clinic is also very clean and hygienic. She never recommended unnecessary medications and tests. Apart from regular visits, she was always available 24 hrs for all our queries and responds quickly whenever we needed.\n\nWe are blessed with a baby boy on 11th December 2019. I really feel short of words to express thanks and gratitude to Dr. Shikha Gurnani. Thank you so much Mam for guiding us and handling my pregnancy and delivery so smoothly and effectively. May God bless you with all the success and happiness in your life. We highly recommend Dr. Shikha Gurnani to all couples searching for gynaecologist. *** ** *** **** ************* *** *** **** *****\n\nParwinder & Sumit",

She makes you feel extremely comfortable and at the same time being straightforward, she explains your current situation in an evident manner without even scaring you. \n\nOn 13th Sep, we were blessed with a baby Boy and we cant Thank her enough for being our counsellor and a friend in this Beautiful and blissful journey. \n\nDr Shikha, We wish you All the Best in your life and would feel grateful if anyhow we can be of little help for you in future.

Our experience of 11 months (pre and post pregnancy) was absolutly fantastic with her. She is very kind, understanding and friendly doctor which made me completely comfortable during my whole pregnancy. Most important thing is that she makes you feel confident about normal delivery which always remain her first choice of advice. she cares greatly about her patients and you will never feel like just another number. She is always available on doc talk for any query and help during your whole pregnancy. I would like to specially mention Venkteshwar Hospital, (advised by her) for superb, genuine and comfortable treatment of me and my baby. Dr. Shikha and her team in hospital, all made my delivery an easy task and presented me a bundle of joy (My Baby).\nSo, whatever criteria you might have when it comes to choosing your Ob-Gynae, it\u2019s important to realise that this person will be responsible for you and your baby\u2019s well-being throughout your\u00a0pregnancy,\u00a0labour and\u00a0delivery.",

It was an amazing experience with her. She not only explained the importance of tests, ultrasounds and symptoms of pregnancy but we made a good bond and understanding which is very important between patient and doctor, especially during pregnancy.\n\nShe is a good listener which helps her to resolve discomforts of patients. She is very friendly, experienced and good in her profession. \n\nNow I am blessed with a baby boy on 16 Dec 2017 with her medications through C-section. I would like to share this C-section done by Shikha ma'am is recommendable. She took very less time and did it in a proper way.\n\nA great thanks to Dr. Shikha Gurnani for being my gynaecologist during my first pregnancy. I would recommend my friends and relatives to Dr Shikha Gurnani for any gynae related problems.\n\nStay blessed Dr Shikha Gurnani !!! Please be in touch. \nLove u ma'am!!!",

Thought of visiting her once, based on the recommendations and previous feedback. Along with that, I did receive a very good feedback about her through my office friends also. She was very very positive and always made sure that we understood each and every complication during pregnancy. She was always available on call even when she was on vacation. If in case she was busy, she made sure that she responds back when she's free. That's the best quality of a doctor and rarely to be found. \r\nShe always encouraged us for normal delivery. And thanks to her, it was a normal delivery with a healthy, handsome baby boy ;-) \r\nNormal delivery!!??: only made possible by her. Otherwise, doctors try to push for c-sac.\r\nEverytime we visited her, we got the same welcoming smile and detailed explanation of each and every problem, doesn't matter it's small one or a serious matter. \r\nNot only us but everyone in our family wants to thank Dr Shikha for her wonderful support!\r\n",

I can truly state that she always ensures to provide a personal motherly care and empathises with the needs and requirements of her patients. Her guidance provided reassurance, making the entire experience more manageable. Her methods go beyond medical excellence as she fosters a comforting environment that truly makes a difference. I am profoundly thankful for her exceptional care and support and would like to specially mention the emotional quotient developed with her. I am just short of words here to sincerely express my forever indebtedness towards her in supporting me throughout my journeys during both my kids deliveries.",

She always gives us enough time to describe our concern during our visit and checks the baby's condition if required. The delivery experience was also great.

As you all know giving birth to baby is no less than a Herculean task. Since this was my first pregnancy, me n my husband were kind of nervous as wanted to be sure about everything and also there were lots of questions in our mind. So we wanted a good doctor who take us though with all the new things happening around us and guide us to right things. So we searched on  google for some good odd days and landed to \u201cpracto\u201d, while scanning through the site we found Mrs Shikha and then as usual we read all the reviews and ratings and decided to go to her, in fact one of the best thing was distance to her clinic, it was right next our society. Got her appointment for next day and We went to her clinic, by the first look we know that our baby will deliver in safe hands, she has some positive aura, always a smiling face and friendly behaviour. Oh I forgot to mention our first doctor who disclose that I am pregnant, that experience was quite disappointed, don\u2019t know why but that doctor is not friendly, so we searched for better Doc and got the Best for us.\n\nYes she is a strict at time but loveable as well, she always encouraged us for normal delivery, during my pregnancy I was gaining weight like anything, so she gave me strict diet schedule and put me on physical exercise so that whatever I eat should burn. I did lot of walk n exercise, she examine me internally in 7th month and told me that my body is very much made for normal delivery, so keep doing your physical activity. \nMy due date was approaching, n my baby hasn\u2019t dropped yet, It started to make us little worried cause if my pains or water break doesn\u2019t happen then we would have to undergo for c-section, being baby was gaining weight and that would make complicate things further. She positively told us on 10th of feb and wished us all the very best for coming week, and yes on 12th feb my water broke, she asked me to go to hospital with in an hour time, with my husband we rushed to hospital immediately.\nNext evening we had our bundle of joy, All the credit goes to our Dr. Shikha n her team in hospital they are very cooperative. They made my delivery very easy.\nHuge thanks to doctor Shikha and her team. \n\nFrom me and my husband side this is the right choice, and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOCTOR\n  \n\nThank you & regards \n\nVibha n Ashish Gautam ",

Her wealth of experience helped me in getting pregnant in just two visits to her clinic.. Third time when I met her I was already pregnant :) ...She is my lucky mascot...Under her guidance my pregnancy was smooth and hassle free..She is prompt in interaction through DocTalk ...She is the doctor who strikes the right balance between professionalism and having that personal emotional connect with you which is very much required during pregnancy and delivery... This quality of her kept me stuck with her... even though I had to travel little far for her consultations.. also I never even thought of approaching nearby doctors after having found her... I had a C-Section delivery.. Like everyone I was scared to go under the knife and even more scared of pain and the whole process but she is the doctor with Midas Touch... Trust me she made the whole process so smooth and comfortable that I thanked God that I am in the right hands...\nLike she helped me in blooming a new life.. I really want others also to benefit from her like I did..\n Not only she does justice to her job but the way she is associated with the cause of motivating her patients in planting tree with the child birth.. best way to give back to society ... this shows her high principles with which she leads her life..\nI highly recommend her...\nPrayers for her good health and long life...Best wishes to her and may she blooms many-many more life\u2019s into this beautiful world!!\n",

Initially, we were bit skeptical about so many positive reviews but thought of meeting her once. After first meeting with her, there was no looking back and we decided to continue with her for rest of the pregnancy. We are glad that we took the right decision. \n* She is friendly and polite with a smile on her face which brings smile on our faces too. Her aura gave us positive vibes and confidence of being in safe hands.\n* She always gave us ample amount of time and attention on each visit. \n* She guided us very well throughout the pregnancy and addresses all our queries and kept us focused on current period in spite of getting bothered about future queries. \n* Her care, concern, personal attention and professional services have played a vital role in my pregnancy journey. My entire pregnancy period went smooth because of her right guidance and advises.\n\nWords will not be enough to express our heartfelt Gratitude towards Dr. Shikha Gurnani. A big Thank you to Shikha Ma\u2019am for blooming our life with most precious gift. You are a true professional and knows the art of blooming your patient lives. God bless you and your family with lots of best wishes from Bharti and Vinod.\n\nWe happily recommend Dr. Shikha Gurnani to everyone who is looking for a good and experienced gynecologist. \n\nAnd Thanks to Practo for being a part of such ultimate find and impacting our lives in this way.\n",

THE GOD\nI was seeing some other gynaecologist before Dr. Shikha and was worried with complications explained to me by one of the so called \"renowned gynaecologist of dwarka\". We met Dr Shikha just to take a second opinion and was very sure we will stick to that famous doctor only. \nWe had a high risk pregnancy and in the very first trimester of pregnancy that doctor said she will do a C section.\n\nWe shared all the reports with Dr. Shikha and didn't told her what previous doctor said. At the end of meeting we asked if we will be able to deliver normally and her answer was so impressive that we continued visiting her(it was not a yes).\n\nOther doctor used to call us every 10 days and didn't really addressed the queries nicely and Dr. Shikha used to call us every 3 weeks and used to give good time and we always had  meaningful conversations. So we visited both doctors for 3 months and at the end of 3 months discovered Dr.Shikha is more of a family member than a doctor. She is not at all money minded person and has power to justify each and every penny you are spending at bloom clinic.\nSo at the end of second trimester Dr. Shikha was our only doctor.\n\nShe is a blend of old school and new school she will advise what all daadi naani does but in a more refined and quantified manner  and on the other hand she will tell you certain things which are very new and all oldies will say not to do like having water after delivery.\nI would highly recommend Dr. Shikha to everyone, she tries her level best for normal delivery however you have to work on all her advises. You have to put in your hard work in exercises and have to have a balanced diet, Dr. shikha can't do anything if you don't exercise or don't follow her instructions....\nTrust me if you go by what she says you will deliver a healthy baby and a normal delivery.\nThanks Dr. Shikha because of your guidance and care we were blessed with a healthy baby girl and it was a NORMAL DELIVERY..\nCheers!\nDeepti Apurv",

Shikha guided us how should we avoid stress and enjoy our lives and how that would help us conceive a child. She is the most calm, composed and supportive doctor I have seen. She has been involved wholeheartedly with us as a doctor. She never recommend for unnecessary medication or test of any sort. At every regular checkup she explained us the next step to be taken with clarity about medication, test and ultrasound that have to be done. My wife had delivered a happy healthy baby girl via C-section delivery method since my wife gave up in labour room after staying in 12 hours of labour pain. Dr Shikha and her colleagues encouraged and motivated to whatever extent they could and then decided to go for C-section considering my wife had developed the high blood pressure tendency in last month of pregnancy and keeping her in labour for long was not good for both baby and my my wife. She  guided us thoroughly throughout the whole journey of pregnancy and it was one of the most fulfilling experience because at the end of the day we got to see our baby girl. Post delivery also as a doctor she guided us how to take care of my wife and the baby. She was always available throughout those 9 months  for consultation in clinic or over the phone. she made sure as a doctor that her patients are relaxed and have a happy healthy pregnancy. At the end I would just like to say that doctor Shikha is the best at her job as a doctor. Thank you doctor Shikha for all your care, love, support and guidance *** ***** *** **** ****** to me and my baby.",

I would have considered going to her again but my last appointment was nothing short of disappointment when she asked me for the payment of Tetanus Shot while us walking out of the room that too her being on a phone call which is extremely unprofessional as it could have been informed inside. The fees already is high as compared to the value you get. Hence, I stopped after few visits. \nThank you!",

She was so comfortable to talk to. I have never seen someone so patient, kind, cool and full of positive vibes. Me and my husband got so much optimistic just in one meeting with her and started our treatment. Within a month I was pregnant. She remained an integral part in my journey of becoming a mother for the first time. Whenever I called her up or texted her for small and minute queries she always responded patiently and positively. She helped me in getting through this entire journey of nine months so smoothly. Today it's been five months being proud parents of a baby girl. All thanks to her. We were reall lucky to find you on Practo. Thank you for being such a sweetheart. \nGod bless you always Mam... :) ",

I have never met such kind of Doctor in my life. For us.. she is like a God who helped us fulfilling our dream. \r\nAs far as treatment and medication is concerned,  one can trust her blindly. Not only this throughout pregnancy and even post pregnancy,  she helped her patients a lot. Its boon to be associated with such doctor who doesnt treat you as a patient but consider you as het own responsibilty. \r\nOne who is facing challenge in conceiving should must visit her. She is your one stop solution. She applies all her knowledge skills and experience in fulfilling your desire of being mother. Apart from complexity one can very well consult her for all gynae related issues. She is best doctor i have ever met. \r\nDo visit her once,  you will yourself understand,  what I want to explain about Dr. Shikha Gurnani. Apart from doctor she is a very nice and bubly lady,  who elopes all your trouble by her smile. Thanks Dr. Shikha for the best gift of our life. ",

She answered all my questions very patiently right since the starting and I felt very confident throughout my pregnancy due to her guidance and support. She clearly and repeatedly explained about  week by week pregnancy process & the progress that too specific to my age and condition. Her presence and intervention during the delivery made the process unexacting compared to my first delivery. I developed a strong bond with her during the past 12 months which made me much more confident throughout this pregnancy. I totally recommend her to all aspiring parents. ",

Dr Shikha is an experienced veteran in her work who has made our pregnancy and delivery experience super seamless. She is polite, calm-headed and responds to all your queries well. One thing that stood out for us is that we somehow found our interactions and experience with the doctor \u201cCOMFORTING\u201d throughout which is very important during pregnancy and all of it is possible when you have a confident doctor like Dr Shikha around. Thanks Shikha Mam for bringing our bundle of happiness into this world. Gratitude!",

We had already visited Dr. Nutan Yadav - Yogashish Clinica couple of times but were not satisfied. After exploring a lot through internet we found Dr. Shikha's profile on practo. Going through the feedback and recommendations on Practo. On the very first visit itself, Dr. Shikha had made an impression in our mind that she a excellent doctor as well very nice person. There was some complication at the end of 3rd trimester but thanks to Dr. Shikha for taking care this. We blessed with a little angle to our life.\n\u3000\nOnce again a special thanks to you for kind guidance. I will strongly recommended you to all my friends and family member.",

Her friendly behaviour, always comforting attitude, vast experience and ability to go extra miles to understand a patient was excellent, rather speechless. We were very much satisfied by her treatment and advise for entire pregnancy period and finally delivered a healthy baby on 19th Apr'18. \n\nThanks Dr. Skhikha for coming all the way with us and filling our lives with a little one which made us happy like never before.\n\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Shikha for everyone in need.",

I came to know about Dr. Shikha through a friend whose pregnancy was highly complicated and Dr. Shikha handled it very well. \n\nMy first meeting with the doctor instilled confidence and faith in her. She has all the qualities of a good doctor. I must mention she is a very good human. She gives enough time to each and every patient and  listens to them very calmly. She explains the reason behind everything (e.g. issues related to baby's development, mother's health, the procedure of treatment, etc). \nI consider it to be the most positive attitude.\nDue to her experience and expertise in the field, her decision-making ability is quite appreciable. \nI wish good luck to Dr. Shikha. I'm\n very thankful to her.",

Before meeting to Dr Shikha, one question was regular clicking to my mind and that was, am I visiting the right doctor? However after meeting her, I was totally satisfied and decided to go with her. During the routine checkups, she guided me well and the best part is that she always gave me the suggestions before I asked for and further to that also she always asked me \"do you have any other doubts?\". She always gave me the correct guidance and her guidance helped me to become a proud mother of a healthy & cute baby girl. Me and my husband, from bottom of our heart would like to say thanks to Dr Shikha. \n\nSimply you are awesome.",

She is well-versed & keeps herself updated with the dynamics of medical world.\nShe is compassionate and attended to our complicated history with patience and empathy.\nHer goal is to interact with her patients in a warm, professional and knowledgeable manner thus ensuring mutual respect and a patient who feels well cared for.\n\nWith her expertise and delicate care we are now proud parent of a healthy baby. \n\nNow I feel wise to choose her as our pregnancy care consultant/doctor. \n\nThank you doctor!\n",

And, yes the response from the doctor will also depend on patience's input as well. So far the first visit seems to be good.I am just writing so that  people out there with same kind of apprehensions can read and visit per their discretion. All the best if you are planning to visit. I will share my further reviews upon my future visits.",

He told me that he has found a doc who has 13years of exp and a good feedback.\n\nThe appointment was booked but trust me as it was my first time I was really scared. I had too many questions and doubts, but the time I met Dr. Shikha I was relieved. She answered all my queries with patience and smile. I was so comfortable with her as if I am talking to a friend instead of a doc. She was always available on call or message throughout my pregnancy. Half of my pain and problems usually disappeared once I met her. Besides being a good doc she is gem of a person. I finally delivered a healthy baby boy.\n\nI definitely recommend her for the future mothers :)\n\nThank you doc!!",

She made sure that I don't panic and handled my case with extreme patience. I am now blessed with a beautiful baby girl and owe everything to Dr.Shikha. Would highly recommend her!!!",

I conceived in the month of April and that time I was 91 kg. I chose Dr. Shikha Gurnani as my gynecologist after checking lot of reviews from Google. \nI gained 23 kgs during this nine months \nof beautiful journey but indeed the gained weight was not at all beautiful, and for it got lot of sweet scoldings also from Dr. Gurnani... \nShe motivated me alot during this journey for maintaining weight but unfortunately I couldn't manage much with that but definitely whatever exercises and workout she told me to do I did that religiously. Thanks to Doctor Gurnani for her constant support and motivation, with 113kg weight I was able to deliver my baby boy normally. \nSo for all the help and support, I would really like to thank doctor Gurnani from the bottom of my heart\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f",

I have PCOS for many years with high AMH and also tubes are almost blocked. Despite all odds I had a normal conception. I was in Kolkata when I conceived. But we knew, Dr. Shikha would be the best gynaecologist for us. We drove back 1500 km to Delhi so that we can be under her guidance. Our baby boy was born at 35 weeks 2days through assisted normal delivery and it would have been impossible if Dr. Shikha wasn't there. We will remain forever indebted to her for being there for every time we needed her. I wish we have more doctors like her and pray for more success in the future. ",

We were consulting her for a normal delivery but on the final day once the labour pain started my wife started asking the doctor for a cesarean operation to avoid the pain. But the doctor explained her that there were no complications and there was no reason to go for an operation. The labour pain could be handled through epidural which we did on her advise. And finally Dr Shikha brought our little Angel to our world and we are grateful to her for this. ",

Then after consultation she asked me to get fresh  thyroid test done along with 5 more test including pregnancy test, even when  I already mentioned her clearly that I was never involved in sexual activity.After 2 days my test reports came and I texted her back. But I never received a reply.  It was only when I raised this issue to customer care , she instantly prescribed me a med for thyroid  ignoring all other reports for assessment. I  highly recommend not to fall into prey with the rating. I hope this will help",

We initially visited mam when we were not able to conceive and I had fibroids. Mam encouraged us to keep on trying and started the medication. I did get pregnant but sadly suffered from ruptured ectopic which mam handled very efficiently. Later mam also did my myomectomy. During the covid times too she was available for her patients. No matter what query we had she always addressed it. Even my successful pregnancy was full of complications, mam really helped us throughout. She listens to all the problems and explains everything patiently. She has that positivity beaming which really kept us encouraging. I bet we couldn't have found a better gynae than mam. Thanks to mam that today I am holding my little bundle of joy. ",

I had few complications like Ulcerative Colitis, but she handled my pregnancy with utmost care and ease. She always encouraged me for a normal delivery and made me do all the exercises that support normal delivery. She always strives for normal delivery even in the hardest situation, however during the end due to certain complications we had to opt for a caesarean delivery. She explained all the pros and cons of C section, which made our decision very easy. I thank Dr. Shikha Gurnani from the bottom of my heart for giving me the best gift of my life, my sunshine..    ",

Although we had some location/distant issues but as we say 1st impression is the last impression.  Her persona and knowledge will make you forget all your concerns.So if you are looking for trustworthy , self centered medical pregnancy consultant she is the person for you.** The long waiting hours at clinic speaks for her capabilities.She is a true professional and will act as a great mentor who will keep you motivated towards a healthy pregnancy .Thank you so much mam for all your efforts and guidance.Keep rocking.Regards,Shivankit & Shikha",

She was clear , precise  and straightforward in explaining complications involved at each stage of pregnancy. She provided the healing touch to our anxious minds. Patiently replied to all our queries and always ready to listen.  I was blessed with baby boy in May 2021,  at a time when pandemic was creating havoc. To add to the drama my husband was out at work and could not make it back for delivery due to lockdown. Again Dr. Shikha provided the healing touch not only as a doctor but also as a friend/ elder sister.  All in all I would say, Thnak you doctor for your immense support throughout. ",

I asked her to do c-section but she said NO you can do normal delivery, have some patience and push push push..just because of her I delivered my baby girl normally. I can say my efforts were 40% but her and team efforts were 60% which enabled normal delivery. A big thank you to Dr. Shikha Gurnani. Women needs doctors like you. You are an angel for ladies, may god give you lots of success and you deliver lots of healthy babies. Thanks is not enough for what you did for me..\ud83d\ude42",

I am blessed with a healthy baby girl with no complications. I am really very grateful to Shikha mam for her support and patience she showed towards me. Will definitely recommend her to all my knowns who are planning to start a new journey.",

We believe for any lady  It's very important that her Gynae is able to connect with her emotionally too, understands her and Shikha does that beautifully.Today we have a healthy baby with no major complications or discomforts be it her availability, finding a right hospital diet, medicines or anything.

Throughout the pregnancy till the final day, she has been really approachable, gave personal attention and her time whenever required. She never rushed through any appointment and answered all the questions, important and silly ones, with patience. She encouraged that we ask as many questions, so that we go to the delivery table with as little doubts as possible. She helped me to deliver healthy little angel through normal delivery, despite getting Covid report positive on final day of delivery.I am very pleased and happy to leverage this platform in thanking you Doctor Shikha Gurnani for all of your efforts that you have put on in adding a new life to our family. I would recommend her to everyone who are looking for a professional and well experienced doctor.",

Very dedicated and approachable doctor, takes out ample time to resolve all your doubts and will always guide you right.Best part is she takes all questions pertinent to first pregnancy and doesn't hurry on closing appointment. The reassurance this brings to a pregnant woman really helps in anticipating coming weeks.All through my pregnancy, I was at ease which is 100% attributed to Dr. Shikha.Given the covid times the clinic is adequately spaced and the scheduling is done in a way to keep rush minimum.Highly recommended to all the ladies!!",

Throughout the journey she was extremely supportive as far as  all our pregnancy related queries were concerned ( believe me there were too many illogical questions ) .  We decided to have her as our doctor for delivery as well . At the time of delivery she was the one who diverted us to Normal Delivery instead of C- section , it was due to her diligent efforts and constant support for hours that made normal delivery possible just the way she has promised us . Thanks for being supportive and honest in your treatment .  ",

Doctor is extremely Good and understanding, rather than prescribing loads of medicine, she is more focused on making the patient understand the underlying issue. Thanku mam for showing so much care and concern. .We are quite satisfied with Shikha mam treatment. We liked the sincerity and value of time she gave for each patient.If she busy (on emergency) she made sure to call us back and gave a solution to our problem and queries. Dr. Shikha treated my wife for the whole pregnancy period and we blessed by baby girl on 29th Jan 2020. We  would definitely recommend everyone to consult her, without thinking twice. Thanku mam for being there whenever we needed guidance n care.We also love the initiative taken by the Bloom Vision Clinic, Plant a tree on the birth of baby.Great people, Great initiative . ",

It was my first pregnancy and after meeting so many doctors I came across her and she was simply amazing. Before I could even ask about my curiosities she would herself talk me through everything like a friend. She was available even when I called her or messaged her. She answers back. She encouraged me for a normal delivery and checked on me if I was exercising properly and taking my diet and pills on time. Somehow I went into labor pains late at night around 3 and she was there as soon as the hospital informed her. And she really helped me get through my labor fast and delivered my baby. During my pregnancy I followed religiously whatever she had asked me to do, all the exercises and activities and in the end it really helped me and reduced my labor time. Even during labor she made me laugh and it eased the pain. She is just amazing. *** ** ***** *** **** ****** **** **** ***",

She genuinely cared, always gave ample time and explained diagnosis so well every single time which greatly assured us. More than anything, we always felt that she was a family member to us throughout this journey. She is extremely positive and caring and above all a great human being. We have a lot of respect for Doctor Shikha and strongly recommend her to everyone. Thanks a ton for everything.",

You can approach her with your queries and concerns and she is there to listen and resolve them. My Pregnancy had many complications but Dr. Shikha dealt it in a smooth way.

We specially admire her attitude of demonstrating the highest standards of strength in the weakest times. She preferred normal delivery from day one and guided us in that direction every time we used to visit her be it in terms of mental strength or physical exercises that will increase the chances of normal delivery and finally on 6th sept we were blessed with our first child and that too normal delivery.

One of our friends suggested us to meet Dr. Shikha and we were glad that we listen to him and met Dr. Shikha for consultation. Dr. Shikha is an experienced Gynecologist and you will get to know in the first consultation only. She was very polite in her approach to her patients and make sure that her patients are comfortable with her and open to discuss their problems without any hesitation. We are constantly in touch with Dr. Shikha and this month (August 2019) we are blessed with a cute baby girl and that too in a Normal Delivery. We thank Dr. Shikha for all the efforts that she has made from her side so that our dreams are fulfilled.",

I was detected with CPP (complete placenta previa) early on in pregnancy and hence was considered high risk pregnancy. Still Dr. Shikha was always positive and motivating while listening to all my logical and illogical queries and fears... With this condition too I had a smooth pregnancy and blessed with a baby boy through cesarean delivery.. Recovery too has been great post caesarean.. For anyone in dwarka looking for gynae I would strongly recommend Dr.Shikha and especially for pregnancy as one always gets positive vibes from her ever smiling face. Thanks a ton for giving me my second bundle of joy (Abhay) on Doctor's day..\n\n- Sonal , Bindesh and proud elder brother Anay",

Though I developed gestational sugar in my last trimester, still she was the one who motivated me for normal delivery (though finally it was C sec operation due to some last moment complications).

Extremely approachable and addresses all your concerns with personal attention. I had a caesarean which was so smooth and less painful that i was on my feet moving around  properly from day 3.

Visited Dr Shikha along with my wife as we were about to be 1st time parents. So much anxiousness, apprehension and lots of questions bin mind which she resolved so patiently during every visit. So engaging with her sense of humour and still she is a strict doctor. She tried her best for a normal delivery of my wife and kept pushing her for relevant exercises etc. Unfortunately, due to high BP of my wife we had to go for Caesec else, we would have also gone for a normal delivery just like my wife's friend on whose recommendation we visited Dr Shikha. Our Angel Avni has arrived in our life and Dr Shikha has played a very important role in it.thanks a lot Doctor.Nidhi, Avni, Abhishek",

She is very confident with her diagnoses, very attached with her patients and always available. \nShe doesn't scare you and at the same time she doesn't hide the seriousness either. Such a balanced person she is. \nI remember ma'am you were about to leave for your vacation and you were equally worried about me because of my problems in the last few days. You operated me before leaving and even called me from your vacation to know about me.\nOverall experience with you had been amazing and yes, the most precious gift of our lives is with us because of you :)\nThanks a lot. Wish you all the best\nLove & Regards,\nBrij, Taru & Chiya",

She heard us less like a doctor and more  like a friend. We were so comfortable to talk to her. Me and my wife got so much optimistic just in one meeting with her and started our treatment. She remained an integral part in my journey of becoming a mother for the first time. Whenever I called her up or texted her for small and minute queries she always responded patiently and positively. She helped me in getting through this entire journey of nine months so smoothly. All thanks to her. We were very lucky to find you on Practo. Thank you ma'am for being such a sweetheart. ",

The results of the endometrial biopsy was cystic glandular hyperplasia  of endometrium was discussed with me.  She did not advice for immediate hysterectomy.  If bleeding recur again then hysterectomy will be done. If within 6 months no bleeding occur she told me to go for ultrasound of the pelvis to check the thickness of the endometrium, only if there's an increase in thickness hysterectomy will be done.

When i visited her i was not sure how long it would take me to become a mother. But her positive attitude and right medication helped me conceive in just two months. i have successfully delivered a baby girl this November. Dr. Shikha was there throughout to support us not only medically but also physiologically. She never made us visit her clinic unless and until required. Also as my pregnanacy was a high risk pregnanacy she helped us contact the doctors in Ganga ram and elsewhere as and when needed. I trust her blindly as a patient .\r\nShe apart from being a doctor always was attached with us a true friend and well wisher. My daughter is a gift from her to us and we thank her for all the efforts and pain she took for us.\r\n",

I would like to share a few insights here . \nLifeline hospital has closed for deliveries from last 4 years and I presume that you had delivered before that. So you writing a review after such a lag is not understandable .\nAs competent obstetrician we gave a fair trial of labour to every would be mother be it a weekday or Sunday as in your case and when their is meconium( as u told the baby had passed potty) with non progress it becomes an indication for cesarean section for betterment of baby and the mother . \n\nI appreciate that you reflected that a fair trial was given to you even on a Sunday but the tone of the review is nothing but an attempt to malign my good intentions towards  you and all mothers to be . \nThe review is a concocted and distorted representation  of the facts .\nHope all is well at your end .\n\nThanks and regards",

My first impression of her was she is a nice, calm, well poised, well behaved and extremely welcoming doctor. She not only gave us confidence of her availability during the pregnancy but also calmed both us. I found her an expert and the one who knows her work very well. After I came out of every visit, both of us were extremely happy that finally we found the right doctor. There was no other doubts thereafter. \nIn the last month, they said that we would be doing C-sec on 16th Aug.2017 if you are not in labor pain. We went to her clinic on 16th Aug 2017. She did something on that day and advised us to go to hospital immediately. The time was 12.30 P.M. She assured her for visit in the hospital at around 3.00 P.M and she came on time and started motivating my wife for normal delivery. At around 4.22 P.M, I finally got our new baby boy in  our life. the amazing thing was that, my wife went for normal delivery and all credit goes to Shikha Gurnani.\n I really had a very nice & wonderful experience visiting Dr. Shikha. I would like to give a big big thanks to her for her ever comforting voice, her amazing expertise and ever welcoming nature. You are the best!!! Thank You! \nHope to see you soon In GOA :)\n(Hemant Dudeja, Rupanka Dua and little baby)\n\n",

Thank you very much Dr. Shikha gurnani and team for converting us from 2 to 3 and working selflessly during this pandemic situation.  First of all, we went to the Bloom vison clinic with a positive mindset as i had already received positive feedbacks from my close relatives but trust me that vibe turned more positive when my wife (with lil one inside) and I met her for the first time. Name of the clinic (Bloom vision) is in line with its work and results. In every scheduled visit, our learning, positivity, trust level, confidence  gradually increased because of her friendly nature, Knowledge, gratitude, patience and many more. So finally ,day came and we reached to the labour room. Me, my wife and family were very much convinced for cesarean treatment seeing my wife in pain and her health but our Doctor asssured us for healthy and normal delivery and ultimately i found my healthy bundle of joy in my lap. Both mother and child were healthy. Journey of my child from his mother's womb to his house was very beutiful, smooth and comfortable. It would be an understatement if i say i have described about doctor and her efforts in my feedback. Again, Thank you very much. God bless you and team.",

Dr. Shikha Gurnani is our doctor which we consulted for pregnancy. In the first meeting itself I had a confidence that surely she will rectify my problem. She is so kindful, very supportive, always positive in her words, smiling face. During pregnancy also she has taken a special care for me. She will answer all our doubts with patience and keep smile in her face. She has given her personal mobile number and asked as to call any time if I have any problem.\nI had never seen a doctor is calling their patients and asking for their health situations. She will make us comfortable and will never force us to do or take unnecessary tests or tablets. Now I had a beautiful baby Boy. I really thankful to you mam. \nI recommend my friends to Dr. Shikha (Bloom Vision Clinic) for pregnancy and almost all had a very good experience with her.\nI'm really very my thankful to you mam.

I spent lot of money prior to that going to other doctors but nobody could cure it. it's because of her my cycles became normal and I could conceive. As soon as I got to know that m pregnant through the kit she is the only one that came to my mind for my beautiful journey. And she proved it right this time as well. We had couple of complications but she handled them smoothly and we always came out with smiling faces. I guess she is the only doctor these days who encourages for normal delivery. She also held classes for free for group discussion amongst same month pregnant ladies. She will give you an elder sister feeling who is always there for you. Well, she gave me the most beautiful gift of my life. people think that they shouldn't have to visit doctors but I feel like being in touch with her always. ** ****** ******* ** *** **** ** ***** I can always count on her. Thank you so much!!!!",

This feedback is not only meant to say thanks to her but we want to help other people as well. Before walking upto her we visited many senior gynaecologist but we were dissatisfied and disappointed. After searching and reading many reviews about her we decided to consult her and this was the most amazing decision we took. She has given us the confidence and the comfort we were looking for. After her guidance I got pregnant and my pregnancy was so smooth, stressless. I literally enjoyed my pregnancy under her guidance. She is the most friendly, extremely approachable and addresses all your queries with personal attention. I always look forward to my appointment as from her I get so much positive vibes which makes me and my unborn baby so happy and make us realise we are in safe hands . On 29th Sep, we were blessed with an angel. She doesn\u2019t treat her patients as patients but as her friend. From deep core of my heart I thank Dr Shikha and wish her all the best in her life. \nLots of love\nSampadaa, Sahil and Ridhanyaa ",

Dr Shikha not only has complete command over her metier but also comes across as a warm and caring person with whom you can share all your medical concerns anytime. From day one, she kept our spirits up and till the end made sure that there is nothing left for us to worry. With God's grace today we are proud parents of a little angel and we will always thank her for pulling us out of all the medical complications we encountered. We wish her all the best so that more and more people can have such safe salubrious nine month journey!",

I would highly recommend her as she is very knowledgeable, polite and professional. I found her through practo.com so was not sure how would the first meeting be. It went fine and after that there was no turn back. She listens to you and make you comfortable so that you can share your concerns with her. She checked with me if I want to go for normal delivery and accordingly set the plan for me. She told me about all the possibilities during delivery. During my labor pain, I gave up and asked doctor to operate me however she kept calm and advised its only 10 mins more and I had my cute little angel delivered within 10 mins. During these 9 months, I was told a lot of time to change doctor by my family and freinds but I had full faith in her. Thanks a lot doctor for your support throughout my pregnancy time. ",

She has been our therapist, supporter & a good friend. Thank you dr shikha for answering all the silliest of our doubts, especially the doubts of my  husband Avinash \ud83d\ude09. She cleared all of them with all the patience. Generally patients donot want to go to hospital and dr, but we used to wait for the next appointment with yours. Her effort before  and during the recovery of child birth was excellent. She never disappointed us throughout our nine months journey until we got to see our bundle of joy. I would recommend all my friends and colleagues to Dr Shikha. Thank you and God bless you  ",

She exactly knows the how serious moderate  or non worrisome the concern is and comforts you better than any doctor I have seen. \n\nI have been consulting her for our pregnancy and have been under her consultation all throughout. She more than having a Midas touch to your problem also has a vibe which is very comforting.She is one of the doctors I have felt has always the best interest of her patients.  In this covid time also, I can totally say she was our strength and we could blindly trust her. She never saw any remorse to  touch or diagnoseg me.

Since day 1, the way she held my wife's hand and motivated her for putting in more and more efforts is much more then what usually doctors do. She never let us feel that my wife is a normal patient to her, rather took care of my wife as mother and guided her throughout. She always sailed us out in times of complications. She has great experience and is fully aware of the decisions she takes. She carries such an aura that problems don't stay for long in front of her.  We always wanted a normal delivery for our baby and We are very grateful to Dr Shikha, that she made it happen for us and made way for our cute little princess. The entire Sharma family is really thankful to her \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f",

Her storytelling is so powerful that you feel at home with her, listening her instructions, sharing your problems, instincts, and getting remedies to overcome general problems while pregnancy is her super plus point. Emphasising special instructions and exercises advices to ensure normal delivery is a key takeaway from Dr. Shikha. Highly recommended. \nI had a normal delivery on 6th May and gave birth to a baby boy. \nOverall it was awesome experience with her.\n\n",

So it is very helpful at this time to have good support from the doctor. We are happy we chose Dr.Shikha for baby's arrival . The reason was very simple - I had really good feedback for the doctor and our experience was also amazing when we visited the clinic for the first time. When we met Dr. Shikha we were pretty confident from the first consultation itself that we are in the right hands. Theses 9 months are definitely not easy and it has almost been a roller coaster with so many ups and downs and mostly downs. We used to panic and would get depressed at times and that is when the immense support from the doctor and she made us feel most comfortable. So our overall experience has been very good.....",

From start to end, we were guided by her at every step in the Pregnancy process with great precision which made our experience comfortable and seamless. She helped my wife in weight loss after which we were able to conceive successfully. In the third trimester we got to know our baby has two loops of cord around her neck which made us worried, however we were comforted and guided really well by Dr. Shikha and successfully had the delivery post 38weeks. She is very knowledgable and easily approachable. We thank her from the bottom of our heart for bringing our little bundle of joy in this world. \nRegards \nPrerna & Puneet Kapoor",

Throughout the pregnancy till the final day, she has been really approachable, gave personal attention and her time whenever required. She never rushed through any appointment and answered all the questions, important and silly ones, with patience. She encouraged that we ask as many questions, so that we go to the delivery table with as little doubts as possible. She helped me to deliver healthy little angel through normal delivery, despite getting Covid report positive on final day of delivery.I am very pleased and happy to leverage this platform in thanking you Doctor Shikha Gurnani for all of your efforts that you have put on in adding a new life to our family. I would recommend her to everyone who are looking for a professional and well experienced doctor.",

She guided me through my whole journey very nicely. I had changed two doctors before reaching her & satisfied with her. She never insisted on having tests from predefined labs as is the case with most of the doctors. I love to visit her in my future also.  One thing I would request to improve on waiting time. A little effort can do it manageable for everyone rest everything is good. \nRegards",

She is very friendly, soft spoken, answer your every types of query even the silly ones you ask for and always available for her patients even on whatsapp. Whenever i had any query i just texted her and every time i got reply from mam. Pregnancy time was passed with timely ultrasound, proper medication and i was blessed with healthy baby girl under the consultation with shikha mam. Also i was discharged earlier than the expected time under the observation of mam. \nThanks a lot mam \ud83d\udc96.",

No family member was able to reach us due to restricted travel, it was Dr. Shikha who was there supporting me and giving confidence to my husband as well that everything will be fine during delivery. During labour as well she was quite helpful available whenever required and made labour pain seem easy.",

We always visited Dr. Shikha at her Bloom Vision Clinic and never had any problem. She connects to you professionally as well as emotionally.\n\nMy wife had Gestational diabetes, in which normal delivery changes are very less, But She did not gave up til the end and did normal delivery.\nShe's an excellent gynecologist, and has a very positive aura.\nHaving her as our gynaecologist, my wife's pregnancy seemed like a breeze.",

She is full of energy. \n\nThe only issue which I had was the waiting time. I had my appointment of 12 pm through Practo, but doctor saw me at 1:50 pm. Coz, it was first come first serve basis. I think this is the problem of staff who are not able to manage appointment and walkins. \nHaving said that, I would still go to Dr. Shikha even if the waiting time is more than that. She has earned that respect, trust and love. I would highly recommend her.  \n",

She is an amazing doctor. I met Dr. Shikha through Practo and did not feel to visit to somebody else. On our first meeting, she heard me like a friend. I have never seen someone so patient, kind, cool and full of positive vibes. Her guidance helped us overcome various first birth myths and fears. Whenever I called her up or texted her for small queries she always responded patiently and positively. She helped me in getting through this entire journey of nine months so smoothly. Today it's been six months being proud parents of a baby girl. All thanks to her. Thank you for being such a sweetheart. God bless you always Mam..",

In the 20th week of pregnancy, I diagnosed with low AFI and after a while with Iugr. Dr. Shikha adviced me to take complete bed rest along with regular medicines and ultrasounds. After all the complications, we welcomed our cute little princess, Riddhi.
