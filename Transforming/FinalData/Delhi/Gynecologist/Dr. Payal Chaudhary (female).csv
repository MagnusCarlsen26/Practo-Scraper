"Doctor friendliness,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr Payal is extremely good gynaecologist. I was suffering from Pcos/Pcod since 2013 . I visited so many doctors and took lots of treatment and mediciens. Though i was suffering from pcos so after marriage it was a big matter  of conceiving. I visited 6-7 gynaecologist but believe me nobody was Dr Payal like. You can trust her you can talk her openly. I got treated by her . It took 3 months and  finally I concieved , and I delivered healthy  twins last year . It was all just by god grace and graceful medium was dr payal . Parents blessings and some good karmas.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy with PCOD,",0,0,YES,"I delivered my baby in December '23 and since then there hasn't been a day without excitement. Giving birth to my baby is the most beautiful experience I've ever had and I'm on cloud 9 since then. Despite 10 hours of pain it has been my best memory and it has been possible only because of my doctor Payal Chaudhary. 
Words can't express the love and appreciation I have in my heart for you Ma'am üôè
Thanks for nurturing the baby and me through this pregnancy. 
Dealing with endometriosis, Payal ma'am immense support, counseling and positivity has given me the strength and hope to conceive without any difficulty. And during pregnancy ma'am support and positive attitude has got me through Hyperemesis gravidarum. 9 months of vomiting and not have proper intake of food is no joke, but with your support I've gotten through this too. 
Thank you sooo much ma'am with all my heart ‚ù§ You have been no less than God for me üôè",2024-05-08 14:21:38,False,True,Bhavana Gautam,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,NO,"Terrible experience.  The doctor has no patience, I had to remind her of my problems, she did not have my casefile with her. She shouted at me for asking questions (I barely asked her a couple of questions from my lab report) and told me she was losing patience with me.  It was a harrowing experience and I wouldn't recommend her to anyone. ",2020-05-06 21:26:16,False,False,Verified Patient,"Dear patient 
It is rather sad that in the era of social media it is so easy to do mud slinging. Despite the risk of COVID to us doctors (remember, we are humans as well) I am seeing patients in emergency everyday and doing tele consults as well so that patients can get the treatment they need. I didn‚Äôt refuse you treatment. You got treatment from me a month ago over tele consult as well and that did work for you. The only thing I said was that to understand your problem you will have to make a visit and you will not be charged anything for that visit. By the way, to make that diagnosis USG is not sufficient and one has to do examination as well. But you refused to understand that at all. 
Best of luck to you",2020-05-07T08:36:07+0000,Dr. Payal Chaudhary
