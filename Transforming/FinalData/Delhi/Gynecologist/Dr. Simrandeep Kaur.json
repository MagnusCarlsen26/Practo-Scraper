When we decided to do the fertility treatment we were well aware of that. We knew that despite the way statistics looked, the process could go either way. After1 unsuccessful IVF and 2 failed Frozen embryo transfers in Canada, we felt quite disappointed. Thats when, one of our family members recommended Dr Simrandeep Kaur. \n\nDr Simran is an outstanding professional and very hard working. She even sacrificed her Sunday mornings for us to make sure we are getting the very best treatment. She works tirelessly not just for us but for every other patient as well. The clinic is very well put together, the staff is very nice and supportive. \n\nNow My wife is 9 weeks pregnant and we are back in Canada. A very big Thank you to Dr. Simran and her team. Even though we are so far away from her but she is still available through various online channels to support us right away when we need to consult with her. \n\nI recommend Dr Simran 10000+ times. You will be in the best hands. Fertility treatment is the right mix of science and God's will. You can rely on Dr. Simran for the science part for sure! \n\nBy God's grace we cant wait to welcome our new born! ",

After studying my case for few months and special tests she did my IVF and for the first time in my life my pregnancy test was positive! It was next to impossible, it had sort of become unreachable dream! Now am 8 weeks and still have a long way to go, can't watfor the special day.

When we decided to do the fertility treatment we were well aware of that. We knew that despite the way statistics looked, the process could go either way. After1 unsuccessful IVF and 2 failed Frozen embryo transfers in Canada, we felt quite disappointed. Thats when, one of our family members recommended Dr Simrandeep Kaur. \n\nDr Simran is an outstanding professional and very hard working. She even sacrificed her Sunday mornings for us to make sure we are getting the very best treatment. She works tirelessly not just for us but for every other patient as well. The clinic is very well put together, the staff is very nice and supportive. \n\nNow My wife is 9 weeks pregnant and we are back in Canada. A very big Thank you to Dr. Simran and her team. Even though we are so far away from her but she is still available through various online channels to support us right away when we need to consult with her. \n\nI recommend Dr Simran 10000+ times. You will be in the best hands. Fertility treatment is the right mix of science and God's will. You can rely on Dr. Simran for the science part for sure! \n\nBy God's grace we cant wait to welcome our new born! ",

After studying my case for few months and special tests she did my IVF and for the first time in my life my pregnancy test was positive! It was next to impossible, it had sort of become unreachable dream! Now am 8 weeks and still have a long way to go, can't watfor the special day.

I was in depression totally frustrated but in my friends insistance l went to her as my friend also had her baby through her. I finally met her eight months back. She was so gentle and patiently listened to our problems. She was never in hurry and gave us time and thoroughly studied our problem.  I am now five months pregnant , all thanks to her. I can't believe am pregnant, am so so indebted to her. Mam please continue this good work. ",
