I would like to mention on the first consultation I knew they gonna be my only Gynae and obstetrician here on. Dr Swati goes out of their way to make you comfortable. They  were  throughout there with me  while I was pregnant and post partum also to help just a message or call away. I haven\u2019t came across any Dr like them. I am immensely grateful to her for their support, services and motivation she had provided throughout my pregnancy. They are the most non judgmental Dr, You can just approach them regarding any issue and would be happy to help you. They have immense knowledge and will guide you through with her counselling.\nI am really really satisfied and would recommend Dr Swati to everyone. You can be just carefree if you are consulting them. She will take care of you like their own. Lastly, I would like to thank Dr swati for just being you.",

I would like to mention on the first consultation I knew they gonna be my only Gynae and obstetrician here on. Dr Swati goes out of their way to make you comfortable. They  were  throughout there with me  while I was pregnant and post partum also to help just a message or call away. I haven\u2019t came across any Dr like them. I am immensely grateful to her for their support, services and motivation she had provided throughout my pregnancy. They are the most non judgmental Dr, You can just approach them regarding any issue and would be happy to help you. They have immense knowledge and will guide you through with her counselling.\nI am really really satisfied and would recommend Dr Swati to everyone. You can be just carefree if you are consulting them. She will take care of you like their own. Lastly, I would like to thank Dr swati for just being you.",

I liked the way she explained all the issues that i had faced during my pregnancy.I will highly recommend Dr. Swati for those who is looking for a good gynecologist.
