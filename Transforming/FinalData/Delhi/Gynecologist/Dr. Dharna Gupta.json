I met her during the last month of my pregnancy as my regular doctor went on to leave and she referred me to her. I was so tensed and worried before meeting her as all of sudden I had to change my doctor along with planning my c-sec delivery due to some medical conditions. With so many doubts in my mind I went to Dr. Dharna's clinic 1 day before my c-sec was planned and it just took her 5 minutes to turn all my doubts into hope, a hope that I can still try for NVD even with some health issues (my LFT was way to high and I had Gestational diabetes too). \n\nI have never seen a doctor as cool, calm and composed like Dr. Dharna (Thanks Dr. Shikha for leaving my in good hands during the most difficult time). \n\nMore than a doctor you treated my like a friend and like an elder person in family. You encouraged me a lot and that's injected life in me. All my worried went off and I was successfully able to deliver my baby boy with your help.\n\nI would recommend a doctor like you to every women who wants to conceive and deliver a child with so much care, support, guidance and encouragement. Thanks a lot Dharna Mam.",

When I came to know my wife is pregnant last year in june we decided to get treatment/regular check up by Dr. Dharna. From day one we noticed that she is very experienced, expert, friendly, positive and encouraging. Due to last two failed attempts to become parents we were not sure if we are ready for the 3rd time but Dr. Dharna encouraged us and made us think positive. I still remember her words on our first appointment \"This baby has to come\". I got my wife checked up regularly by Dr. Dharna for 8-9 months and yes finally baby has come this February. Thanks again Dr. Dharna and keep smiling :)",

I met her during the last month of my pregnancy as my regular doctor went on to leave and she referred me to her. I was so tensed and worried before meeting her as all of sudden I had to change my doctor along with planning my c-sec delivery due to some medical conditions. With so many doubts in my mind I went to Dr. Dharna's clinic 1 day before my c-sec was planned and it just took her 5 minutes to turn all my doubts into hope, a hope that I can still try for NVD even with some health issues (my LFT was way to high and I had Gestational diabetes too). \n\nI have never seen a doctor as cool, calm and composed like Dr. Dharna (Thanks Dr. Shikha for leaving my in good hands during the most difficult time). \n\nMore than a doctor you treated my like a friend and like an elder person in family. You encouraged me a lot and that's injected life in me. All my worried went off and I was successfully able to deliver my baby boy with your help.\n\nI would recommend a doctor like you to every women who wants to conceive and deliver a child with so much care, support, guidance and encouragement. Thanks a lot Dharna Mam.",

When I came to know my wife is pregnant last year in june we decided to get treatment/regular check up by Dr. Dharna. From day one we noticed that she is very experienced, expert, friendly, positive and encouraging. Due to last two failed attempts to become parents we were not sure if we are ready for the 3rd time but Dr. Dharna encouraged us and made us think positive. I still remember her words on our first appointment \"This baby has to come\". I got my wife checked up regularly by Dr. Dharna for 8-9 months and yes finally baby has come this February. Thanks again Dr. Dharna and keep smiling :)",
