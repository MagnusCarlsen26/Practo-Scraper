Been through google reviews, Practo reviews and also had prior visit to a doctor in my hometown and here also spoken with few on phone, everyone will speak with you frankly as the profession is like that but no one likes to encourage for a normal delivery even when everything was in favour of that.\nDr. Mohini has not only supported us for normal delivery during our initial talk but also encouraged and guided us in the very short span of time. Unfornuately, we had to go with C-section as my spouse tried for around 12 hours for normal delivery with no luck. All went well and both my wife and my child is doing well. *** ** *** **** ********* ****** *** ********** ** ***** glad that I visited her \ud83d\ude0a\nAgain thanks a lot Mam for supporting us.",
