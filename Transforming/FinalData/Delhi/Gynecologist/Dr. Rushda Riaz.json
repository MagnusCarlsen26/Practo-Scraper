Initially, we went to a Gynae and as per her advice \u2013 we got done the ultrasound but she told this baby cannot be carried further and D&C is required. Then I discussed the matter with Dr. Aditya Jayaraman and he told to get in touch with Dr. Riaz (Gynae). She told us to get done one more ultrasound after 1 week, we got done and sent the report to Dr. Riaz \u2013 that was the miracle, heartbeat of baby was observed and she called me herself to start the medication to avoid any miscarriage.\nSince then we followed all advices given by Dr. Riaz. There were some difficulties but Dr. Riaz managed so well and guided us accordingly.\nFinally, we have got a baby boy (in normal delivery done by Dr. Riaz). Dr. Rushda Riaz has become our \u201cANGEL\u201d now.\nGOD BLESS YOU (Dr. Rushda Riaz). Thanks a lot MAM.",

Initially, we went to a Gynae and as per her advice \u2013 we got done the ultrasound but she told this baby cannot be carried further and D&C is required. Then I discussed the matter with Dr. Aditya Jayaraman and he told to get in touch with Dr. Riaz (Gynae). She told us to get done one more ultrasound after 1 week, we got done and sent the report to Dr. Riaz \u2013 that was the miracle, heartbeat of baby was observed and she called me herself to start the medication to avoid any miscarriage.\nSince then we followed all advices given by Dr. Riaz. There were some difficulties but Dr. Riaz managed so well and guided us accordingly.\nFinally, we have got a baby boy (in normal delivery done by Dr. Riaz). Dr. Rushda Riaz has become our \u201cANGEL\u201d now.\nGOD BLESS YOU (Dr. Rushda Riaz). Thanks a lot MAM.",
