Though this was our second pregnancy but the overall journey was completely different compared to the first one. From Gynae\u2019s perspective there were many challenges thrown by the baby(they started from 2nd month LLP and continued till the delivery :) ) and Doctor ensured that she informed mother of all the precautions which were needed. Dr. Mittal took time to explained everything in a very professional and detailed manner and ensured that if we feel comfortable in discussing anything with her. \n\nDuring Labour which got really extended, Doctor\u2019s face told us, that she didn\u2019t feel the things were right for continuing the normal labor pain as baby\u2019s heartbeat were getting low. After sometime Dr. Pankhila informed us that shes moving the delivery to Cesarian as at that moment, medically  the risk was higher. She felt uncomfortable in informing this to us as since beginning the signs of having a normal delivery were quite high and the first delivery was also normal for us. We trusted in her more than 100% and asked her to act whatever she thinks is just. By God\u2019s grace, her decision was proven right as it was discovery that there was a true knot in umbilical cord which prevented the baby to come down. Had she pursued normal delivery this could have lead to Asphyxiation, which would have been disastrous. \n\nWould highly recommend her and have send more than 5 friends to her already and all have similar experience. \n\nThanks for everything Dr. Pankhila. \n",

She was very polite and patient during our interactions, and clarified all our doubts and concerns fully, even during late nights when we would reach out to her, which was very reassuring. She always had a smile on her face while interacting with us, and was full of positivity, and took great care while delivering our baby normally. I highly recommend her.",

Though this was our second pregnancy but the overall journey was completely different compared to the first one. From Gynae\u2019s perspective there were many challenges thrown by the baby(they started from 2nd month LLP and continued till the delivery :) ) and Doctor ensured that she informed mother of all the precautions which were needed. Dr. Mittal took time to explained everything in a very professional and detailed manner and ensured that if we feel comfortable in discussing anything with her. \n\nDuring Labour which got really extended, Doctor\u2019s face told us, that she didn\u2019t feel the things were right for continuing the normal labor pain as baby\u2019s heartbeat were getting low. After sometime Dr. Pankhila informed us that shes moving the delivery to Cesarian as at that moment, medically  the risk was higher. She felt uncomfortable in informing this to us as since beginning the signs of having a normal delivery were quite high and the first delivery was also normal for us. We trusted in her more than 100% and asked her to act whatever she thinks is just. By God\u2019s grace, her decision was proven right as it was discovery that there was a true knot in umbilical cord which prevented the baby to come down. Had she pursued normal delivery this could have lead to Asphyxiation, which would have been disastrous. \n\nWould highly recommend her and have send more than 5 friends to her already and all have similar experience. \n\nThanks for everything Dr. Pankhila. \n",

We then came in contact with Dr Pankila, which proved to be one of our best ever decisions. She was very polite and patient during our interactions, and clarified all our doubts and concerns fully, even during late nights when we would reach out to her, which was very reassuring. She always had a smile on her face while interacting with us, and was full of positivity, and took great care while delivering our baby normally. I highly recommend her.",

She is indeed the best doctor I have come across and I wish her all the best for her future endeavours, I feel we need more doctors like her who are so trustworthy, compassionate,  promising and full of love and positivity.Thank you for everything Dear Pankila and I am sure I would stay in touch with you always \u2763\ufe0f",

She was always available to support us on the phone/ whatsapp when required. Every visit feels like that we are meeting our own family member.\nHer guidance and attention to details during prenatal,Intranatal and post natal period were beyond commendable.\nAnd trust me, Whenever we visit her clinic we had lots of worries & queries in our mind as it was our first pregnancy but everytime she does some magic with her Jaadu ki jhappi that all our anxieties and fears just flew away \nMoving on to my delivery experience, My Delivery is not planned one as due to some complications, I delivered early from my due date. It was premature delivery so we were in so panic situation but Pankila Ma\u2019am handled everything very smoothly. I remember how she comforted me and encouraged me in OT as I am feeling very anxious and emotionally low. Thank you so much ma\u2019am and seriously mam you are no less thn a God to me at that moment. \nWe are truly blessed to have you as our doctor. You are really a gem to our society. Really thankful to you for all your kind words, support & guidance throughout our wonderful journey.\n",

Her concern and support extends all the way to post delivery care and counselling.\n\nThe kind of confidence she instills leaves no space for self doubt about being to cope up with so many changes in life.\n\nAll over she has been a great friend like  Doctor to both of us.\n\nAditi & Tarun ",

I had two cycles of follocular monitoring but those two were also unsuccesful but mam always motivated me to never loose hope\ud83d\ude42 and after taking proper medications suggested by mam I got to see those two pink lines.\nI was on bed rest due to some complications in my pregnancy but mam was always there to explain my problems and clear all my doubts. \nAt the time of delivery I had water leakage at 1 am and I called her and  she asked me to reach hospital asap.  So I think for any doubts or any emergency she is just a call or msg away .\nMam was in touch with the doctors till I reached my hospital and got checked and admitted by doctors. I had a very smooth delivery with her. \nShe is very friendly and knowledgable doctor and I am blessed that I opted her as my doctor.\nNow she is not just a doctor but my friend , my family and a true motivator for me\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\nI would highly recommend her to upcoming parents\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4d",

All my worries were put to rest with her smiling face while she counselled. \nI can never forget how she counselled my husband to prepare baby\u2019s bag on his own and let me rest after delivery.\nAll these small examples reflect how empathetic and understanding she was.\nI was pretty determined on having a normal delivery but due to being in labour for several hours, I started to lose hopes but she stepped in and told me to give my best shot at this although I had to get operated later due to foetal distress but I would have opted to get operated much before if she wouldn\u2019t have given me so much strength. \nThankyou Dr. Pankila for making my journey so beautiful.\nYou are amazing!

Being from Pune and completing 8 months of my pregnancy term there, I was planning to have my baby in Delhi (my maternal home) but was struggling with getting any Gyno on board to take me on as a patient at the last month. That's when I got the reference of Doctor Pankila Mittal from a colleague and upon a single visit with her I knew she was the perfect fit for us.\nI can't thank her enough for taking up our case, even at the very end of my term and help us deliver our bundle of joy.\nEach visit was very candid with her, and I felt that I could ask her any question without anxiety. She got my Husband involved in this process and helped ease any of his queries and anxieties (especially with us being first time parents as you can imagine we had lots of it). She prescribed me with the right exercises and diet, which I followed religiously. All this culminated in a normal delivery without complications.\n\nI would definitely recommend her to any and all planning/in-term, mothers to be. Her professional, humble and very personal approach with her patient makes one think they are not charting this journey alone.\n\nI would also recommend you to follow her ******* ***** *********************************************** you can get a lot of information about everything related to pregnancy.",

Starting for handling me during pregnancy time till visiting me post delivery, you have been such a comforting & assuring through all these times.\n\nHonestly speaking I had been struggling to find a good gynae here (sasural) for last 3 years and had to visit my old gynae near maeka which was far away. With you my search for gynae is over.\nThe way you handled my case and made me calm is beyond my thinking. From taking my case in 3rd trimester to taking quick decision for my delivery is what shows about you that how much you take every case personally. At the time of delivery too , i was really scared for the operation but with you there by my side everything was very smooth. With all these things we did not feel at a single moment that we are in the hands of doctor, we felt like you are our family. \nI am just not able to thank you enough for being there for me at all times. All I can say is, thank you so so much for everything \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70",

She made me walk through the entire journey like a friend, mentor and a guide and it was her who made me believe, there will be one day when things will be fine\n\nEverything went well during my pregnancy but there has to be a turning point....in a smooth sailing. She rushed to the hospital when baby's heart beat dropped and she came to the ot and said don't worry...I'll look into everything.\n\nDear friends when you are going through tough times you need someone to give you reassurance, so believe in her, follow her advises whether it's exercises, or high protein diet or sleep. Things will work in your favour.\n\nKudos to Dr pankila and the way she is passionate about her profession. There is a saying make your profession your passion and she lives that life\n\nAll the best......ladies for beautiful times ahead. Remember faith in God and your dr makes everything happens.",

We had absolute clarity on all the medications prescribed and all the tests performed. \nIn the end, I delivered a perfectly healthy baby.\nDr Pankila is a great counselor, a very understanding and supporting human being and an excellent doctor . Truly selfless medical service is what one can expect. Thanku you doctor for being with us whenever we needed your guidance and care.

And this wish was fulfilled as we met Dr. Pankila as she also believes and is adamant towards natural ways, so with this belief, support and continues motivation I delivered (normal delivery) a baby girl on 11oct 2021.Even with all the complication during my pregnancy i.e. corona during 12 week of my pregnancy, low lying placenta, restricted blood flow to the fetal, nucal cord etc. Dr pankila has gone above and beyond to make sure that my complete health and wellness have been made first priority.It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend Dr Pankila anyone seeking answers to any gynae related issues and do so in a very personalized way.P. S. Thank you Dr Pankila for relieving us of all our anxieties and queries by being there as friend, family and best doctor I can ask for. Also thank you to all her very supportive staff at Gynae Bliss that made our journey more beautiful and smooth going.",

My complete pregnancy journey was one of the best experience because of her. This is the 2nd child I gave a born to and 1st son is 6 years old. If I'll compare my 1st pregnancy and post pregnancy journey with the current one. I would say this is the best journey I could have ever imagined. Our doctor's plays a vital role in our journey. Though there are many good experiences I have , but would like to share,  One or two instances i would like to share. One is, whatever test she asked me to perform she makes sure that she'll always explain why she is going to perform this test and what are the outcomes of those test. Secondly, I had a big trauma for c section due to my previous c-section experience. But Dr. Pankilla's every word of mouth got corrected for me. She says this time you'll stand at ur own within 2-3 days. After that, you will be able to manage your every thing the way normal delivery women do. And trust me, I can actually felt all those things. I have much more to say about her coz words are more but this page is not enough to thank her for her so much support and guidance. \nI really wish God bless her with all the good health and happiness. She is so positive and very caring\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

After seeing 'n' number of doctors due to switching cities in the middle of our pregnancy and later Covid lockdown, meeting Dr. Pankila was like a blessing in disguise. From our very first appointment, we knew that we have found the right person whom we can trust for the delivery of our little one. We have always wanted a natural and normal delivery and Dr. Pankila made it possible. Her positive and motivating attitude has always been a real stress buster. One remarkable quality about her is the amount of time she gave personally to clear all our innumerable doubts and questions and preparing us for the D-day. I have seen no other doctor investing so much time which clearly stands Dr. Pankila apart. To add to this, her modern yet traditional approach towards pregnancy and it's care is praiseworthy and one of a kind. ** ******* *** ******* ** *** ** *** ****** ************* ** ***** *** wish her all the success in her professional and personal life. Cannot thank her enough for bringing our little bundle of joy safely into this world.\n\nBests,\nSwati and Alok",

We had conceived and there were a few medical doubts and risks, which had us concerned, but when we met her, she calmed our nerves and helped us see the positives rather than scare us unlike other doctors.\nThroughout my pregnancy, she was like a total support system, a friend, a guide, a person I could talk to and explain my fears and contact her any time of the day, and she was spot on available any time!\nI would never have thought a doctor could be so friendly towards their patients. Over the time, she became a friend to us, whom you could look up to. I remember I wasn\u2019t doing well emotionally, and when me and my husband went to her for our regular checkup, he told her I wasn\u2019t doing well. She consoled me and calmed my nerves and made me a happy human being, again. I can never thank her enough, for being there for us, always.\nThroughout the pregnancy, she was one pillar of strength for both of us. She guides her patients throughout the way, and is so approachable, unlike other Gynaes. Even in the labour room, I was relieved to know she was there, and everything was just going to be fine. She is truly Godsent!",

She has been a guiding force behind our successful delivery.\n\nIts been 17 years of our married life and had lost all our hope of becoming parents. But it all changed once we came to know we r pregnant.  No second thoughts we rushed to meet Dr Pankila Mittal. We were paranoid and way too stressed not knowing if its a complicated pregnancy and how would everything turn out. Previously we had 2 misscarriages so our stress levels were sky rocketting. \n\nDr Pankila came into our life as a blessing. I think this time god wanted all to go well. Dr Pankila from day one treated us as her own family. Every single time visiting her wid multiple doubts she would listen to us and explain each and everything very calmly. She knew we were a paranoid couple but her positivity and motivation sailed us through this phase with confidence. \n\nAll thanks to Dr Pankila Mittal for delivering us a healty baby boy.",

She is the best guide, mentor, doctor, friend and treated us none other than but like a family. Our bond has become so strong that we wont be able to forget those 9 months being with her. From the bottom of my heart, I would like to say that Im gonna miss her a lot, her beautiful gesture and lovely smiley face always. She used to give us 20-25 minutes to discuss and answered each query. Last but not the least, Dr Pankila is the bestest Doctor ever met/seen /visited . Wish you all the best Mam for everything. Lots and lots of love\nRegards",

We forged a great bonding based on trust and emotional connect. We could not have asked for a better treatment and care both emotionally and medically. She prescribes any medication or lab test only when it is absolutely required unlike others who do the contrary bringing disrepute and distrust for doctor profession. She is true brand ambassador to the profesion. To have a doctor like her is a blessing for the entire life. She is equally great as a person & a doctor. Both qualities (great doctor and great person) compete to ace up the other. May god bless her with all the happiness and success in her life. We highly recommend her for anyone who is looking to a have genuine treatment.",

She cleared my doubt in person as well as on whatsapp. So I had my scan which showed few complications and that suggested for c-section. I really wanted to give normal delivery a shot,  so we tried and delivered normally. She actively kept a check on me and motivated me throughout the whole labour and delivery. I just adore her positivity and easily approachable  nature. ",

She listened to all the queries patiently and explained details very well that helped in reducing the pregnancy anxiety.Basis our positive interaction with her we also changed our delivery place from a big hospital to her nursing home Gynae Bliss which is the best decision we took. The staff is so helpful and caring, they just made us feel like home. A big thanks to the whole team of Gynae Bliss and Dr. Pankila for helping us bring our little one into the world with ease. ",

But she on contrary made me belief fun abhi shuru hua hai. I danced my heart out,  I attended marriages without any insecurity. Not only me but she guided my husband too well that he didn't let me miss any fun.\nPeople continuously kept telling me to drop the plan of private hospital Kynki vo wait nhi krte direct C-section krte h but she kept my spirits high and prepared me for the best.\nTill last moment of my delivery you were a great support. Big thanks to whole team.\n",

She suggested us nutritious Diet chart to follow, various exercise to follow and top of that the importance of having a positive attitude. Whenever I was in doubt I used to quickly get in touch with her through messages or calls and I really appreciate her her and her teams prompt response towards my query.

Her clinic coordinator even demonstrated those exercises which prevented any negative posture.  I am really satisfied with her guidance and support.. she was a call away whenever I needed her.. since childbirth is unplanned so unfortunately she was out of station during my delivery. But, her team made me have a normal delivery in which she was continuously connected to me via her phone. She came to meet me as soon as she reached Delhi which was such a sweet gesture.. I am really happy that I reached such a sweet gynac for my first baby. ",

Never did we ever felt if we were alone in this. She was right next to us whether it was day or night; whether it was dark or light. We can only thank that moment where we were enlightened to go to Mrs. Mittal. It was one of the best ever made decisions of our lives and also a life changing one. 13 days ago we were blessed with a child who was given birth by this doctor full of excellence and miracles. A hearty gratitude from me, my wife, my family and especially the little boy who is seeing the light of this planet just because of your perfect and honest consultancy and guidance. Thank you for gifting us this pure  gem out of your holy hands on my wife\u2019s birthday. XoXoXo \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc76\ud83d\udc23. Please stay the way you are.",

Narrowed down her clinic after visiting a couple of other specialists amid pandemic and I am glad we made the right call. From day 1 of the visit till post natal care, she offered the best of the advice throughout the entire pregnancy and ensured that my wife and the baby, both remain healthy and happy. From food to meds to excercise, her advice were on-point without playing it safe and suggesting more than that needs to be done. We had a normal delivery and surely the credit goes to her ways of handling things. Plus it's nice to see a doctor smile and laugh every time you visit her, does quell the pregnancy concerns a little. Cheers to her professionalism.",

The services ( pregnancy tests, follow ups, guidance, ultrasounds, UTI etc.) which We received from her were excellent. Dr. Pankila Mittal and the staff are very friendly and ensured that we are properly informed about my wife\u2019s health and care. I would have no qualms in recommending her to family and friends. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care.",

We had a history of 2 miscarriges so we were worried if history would repeat itself. The only regret I have now is why I didn't decide to change my wife's old gynecologist and find her earlier as it was my wife's 3rd trimester when we met her. Despite preeclampsia she made sure both mother and baby were safe. My wife is recovering well now thanks to her constant push for exercising and healthy eating.\nFinding a doctor who can perform tests, read reports and write medical prescriptions is easy these days, but finding a humane soul who, along with all the above things, truly loves her work and cares about the well being of her patient - that's Dr. Pankila Mittal! Doc is absolutely from a different world altogether!! I remember her treating my wife like a little sister and making jokes to make her laugh and relieve her stress. We need more medical professionals like her in the world.\nEven the support staff is polite, friendly and proactive which is truly amazing and a cherry on the top!",

And when she was not able to receive my calls she would always call me back, when she was informed about the same.\nIt has been a great journey till now, and hope to further continue her guidance and consultations till im here. She has been a really good friend in the form of a doctor,who helped me deal with things emotionally, mentally and physically.\nI would definitely recommend her to all.\n",
