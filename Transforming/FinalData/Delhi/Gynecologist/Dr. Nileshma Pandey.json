The recommendation came following a sonography and we were left unsure about the next steps.\n\nOur journey took a turn for the better when we consulted Dr. Nileshma on July 10, 2024. From the very beginning, Dr. Nileshma 's approach was both reassuring and thorough. She patiently explained the entire procedure, addressed our concerns, and provided clear guidance on what to expect. Her positivity and calm demeanor were incredibly comforting, giving my mother the confidence to proceed with the surgery promptly.\n\nThe procedure involved the successful removal of the uterus along with the large fibroid through Laproscopy by Dr Nileshma.\n\nWe are deeply grateful for Dr. Nileshma",

From the very beginning, Dr. Nileshma 's approach was both reassuring and thorough. She patiently explained the entire procedure, addressed our concerns, and provided clear guidance on what to expect. Her positivity and calm demeanor were incredibly comforting, giving my mother the confidence to proceed with the surgery promptly.\n\nThe procedure involved the successful removal of the uterus along with the large fibroid through Laproscopy by Dr Nileshma.\n\nWe are deeply grateful for Dr. Nileshma",

Her advice is golden and directed toward the benefit of her patient (both financially and personal well-being). We were blessed with a baby boy and for these 9 months, she was always there for us. Her ratings and reviews here are from people like us who have witnessed her hard work and quick response. I am grateful for her help and it's my honor to write something for her (this is the least I can do for her). I remember, I called her at midnight and she was there to take the call. She loves her work and never creates a burden on your pocket. Not even a single message or call or advice went unheard. She always responded quickly on WhatsApp for these 9 months. She is a talented gift from God and I wish her all the success, happiness, and love of this world.\nLove & Blessings from a happy Mother who is writing this . Thank you so much\nMa'am\ud83d\ude4f",

She is one such doctor who picks up our phone calls anytime even if in the late night in case of emergencies. If she fails to receive the calls, she usually calls back. Which is a very rare characteristic of the doctors, now a days. I always get amazed by seeing her prescriptions where she writes every details of the disease, symptoms, key test findings, and advises. She always explains every details of the disease and moreover she answers all of our questions, even if they are the silly ones. This is the way she essentially boosts our confidence. Recently she did my wife's delivery. She was extremely careful and I recovered within a week. A lot of thanks to madam. She is the best. The biggest thing about her treatment is that a patients gets half-cured by her wonderful behaviour. Madam, please take immense care of yourself and obviously the patient's like us as well. In summary Nileshma Maam is one of the best doctor I have ever seen.",
