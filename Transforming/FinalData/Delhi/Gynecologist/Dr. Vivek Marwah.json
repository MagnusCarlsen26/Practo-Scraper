By that time, we knew that hysterectomy was the only option for her as she was living with extreme pain. But even in that critical stage, Dr Marwah reassured us and even managed to save one ovary during the surgery. What's more, my wife recovered quite fast, considering the stories we had heard about slow and painful recovery of hysterectomy patients. We only wish we had known about Dr Marwah earlier, maybe hysterectomy won't have been needed at all ... ",

I needed a procedure (lap. hysterectomy) done which I didn\u2019t want to be done by Dr\u2019s around me & that is why I went to Dr. Vivek. I fondly remember the sense of belongingness and I feel great  that within a day of the procedure, he made me walk and then started walking 2 miles a day in less than a month later. I trust him with my life and in return he's made quality of life so much better for me. Thank you Sir!",
