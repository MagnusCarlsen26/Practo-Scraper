Seriously, you've been amazing!\nI visited doctor for my PCOS issue, doctor listen to our problems very carefully, made us feel totally comfortable and taken care of. I got pregnant during the treatment.  I experienced some unexpected bleeding early on, and let me tell you, it was terrifying. But thanks to Dr. Rachna's expertise and care, alongside the diligence of the Sir, we navigated through it with confidence.\nDoctor took the time to thoroughly assess the situation, explain everything in a way that was easy to understand, and most importantly, provided reassurance that everything would be okay. Their calm and composed demeanor helped ease my worries and gave me the strength to stay positive throughout my pregnancy journey.\nAnd when it came time for delivery, I couldn't have asked for a better captain of the ship. Your cool, calm, and collected vibe kept us all grounded, and your quick thinking made everything go smoother than I could have imagined.\nMy little one arrived healthy and happy with normal delivery, and I couldn't be more grateful for the care we received.\nIf anyone facing similar challenges or just want a caring and capable doctor, to guide you through your pregnancy journey and delivery, I highly recommend reaching out to Dr.  Rachna Verma.",

Seriously, you've been amazing!\nI visited doctor for my PCOS issue, doctor listen to our problems very carefully, made us feel totally comfortable and taken care of. I got pregnant during the treatment.  I experienced some unexpected bleeding early on, and let me tell you, it was terrifying. But thanks to Dr. Rachna's expertise and care, alongside the diligence of the Sir, we navigated through it with confidence.\nDoctor took the time to thoroughly assess the situation, explain everything in a way that was easy to understand, and most importantly, provided reassurance that everything would be okay. Their calm and composed demeanor helped ease my worries and gave me the strength to stay positive throughout my pregnancy journey.\nAnd when it came time for delivery, I couldn't have asked for a better captain of the ship. Your cool, calm, and collected vibe kept us all grounded, and your quick thinking made everything go smoother than I could have imagined.\nMy little one arrived healthy and happy with normal delivery, and I couldn't be more grateful for the care we received.\nIf anyone facing similar challenges or just want a caring and capable doctor, to guide you through your pregnancy journey and delivery, I highly recommend reaching out to Dr.  Rachna Verma.",

You have written the review for your relative which should not be done.\nSomething seemed very wrong about this review, so i consulted my staff and checked our security cameras. \nPatient was advised whole abdomen ultrasound and never forced to be done charges of which are displayed at reception. Fortis next door charges 3100.\n I am sorry to say but if you were smart enough to write a negative review, you also were smart enough to check the medicine prices in our clinic online  on phone where the 25% discount had a cap of 50 rupees.  For tissues in ultrasound room,those were not toilet paper rolls, they are tissue rolls. You can google them (Wonder Kitchen Tissue Rolls on Amazon). We're sorry but if you can't afford high quality service, there are a lot of cheaper services out there with a lot more than 25% discount and no cappings. Still better would be going to GOVT HOSPITAL where consultation, investigation like ultrasound and prescribed medicines will be given FREE OF COST to you. We always try to give a holistic service to our patients under one roof for convenience. Giving bad reviews because you are having a bad day is not very nice.  This is a clinic with over 20 years of operations where we value our patients and the distress they are in, for which they need to seek our help. And keeping these in mind, we offer value and quality under one roof to provide the best doctor-patient relationship to whoever visits us. We are always open to honest constructive criticism and we are always striving to improve. We hope you have a better experience elsewhere. Get well soon .",

We were so worried don't know what to do in this covid-19 situation. We got to know about Dr Rachna Verma through my friend. \n\nWhen we visited Dr Rachna Verma after that we were so relaxed. The thing about Dr Rachna Verma is she understands her patients and listens to them and their questions very calmly. We have so many questions for her because we are going to have our first baby and she answered them all.\n\nNow we are blessed with a baby boy and it was a normal delivery. \n\n\nThank you so much Dr Rachna Verma for all you care and help. Thank you, thank you so much!!",

Though her clinic was far off from our house , but once my wife met her , she decided that she would be our doctor during her pregnancy .. she has been very helpful throughout the pregnancy , she always insists on normal delivery until and unless c-sec is medically required and there is no option left .. the best thing about her is that she doesn't scare you unnecessarily for small things the best thing about her clinic is that she has a inhouse ultrasound facility and it is easier for the patients to get their report at the same time .. thank you doctor for your support during my wife's pregnancy .. we are blessed with a baby girl on 22nd July, 20 and it was a normal delivery .. would definately recomend her ..",

She is definitely not out of those who believes in minting money by digressing the patients , but would be very honest in letting the person know about the next steps to be taking without wasting time and money . Iam very convinced with the treatment i have gone through under her supervision and  would highly recommend her to others too . Would like to take a minute to extend my thanks to the staff ( rajni & jyoti ) as they has been very caring and supportive throughout .\n\nThanks once again Dr, Verma for showing the ray of hope and looking forward to get the best out of your treatment ..Wishing you and sir loads of success ",
