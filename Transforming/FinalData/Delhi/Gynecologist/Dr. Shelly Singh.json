The doctor listens patiently to her patients and is humble and soft-spoken. Additionally, she only advises necessary tests and scans at the right moment, and never forces patients to undergo unnecessary tests for the promotion of the hospital or other reasons.\n\nWe had planned for our baby to be delivered in the elite Rosewalk segment of Rainbow hospital, but due to complications during the birth, our baby required neonatal care. Then Dr. Shelly, chose to deliver the baby in the less expensive hospital (Rainbow), prioritising the health of the mother and baby over her own financial gain. Both Rosewalk and Rainbow are part of the same hospital, Rosewalk being the more expensive section with additional services. We are grateful to Dr. Shelly for the exceptional care provided to us and our baby. She was extremely helpful post pregnancy and we still reach out to her for any concerns. I would recommend her to everyone I know and I hope this review helps the readers make a good choice.",
