"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,NO,"I visited to india ivf for SSG test, initially they told me that i need to consult doctor before SSG and the first consultation is free.They told me to pay advance money for SSG and till the time my treatment is not over consultation will be free.My SSG experience was good,doctors were professional but let me tell you there staffing,management and whole system is very poor.
1)First they have atleast 10 numbers,everytime there will be a new number asking or providing reports on whatsapp which is really very annoying infact they themselves get confused and i have received someother patient reports many time on my number. Reports are quite confeditanal so these things should be taken seriously.
2) They will take a hour to take printouts,You need to spoil your full day to get your treatment done even it is a small one as there staffs work on minus speed
3) They don’t provide you proper bills, summary type printouts are given to you where no GST no other details are mentioned so if you will try tò reimburse it,your company will not accept it.
4) Doctors and the staffs told me that i and my husband both need to get viral markers test done like HIV,blood group etc as there labs handle proper IVF cases which is risky but i got reports of my viral marker test after my ssg and same with my husband also****** **** ***** ******* ********* *** **** ** ***** ********* ***** * ********** ***** **** ******* ** ** ******** *** *** ****i visited for consultations there was some issues with my husband reports, they asked me to pay consulation fees again hence i arruged with them so they told me that they will discuss with management and let me know,today they called me but i am not at all feeling like to visit again
5) The wierdest thing is that today i visited for consultation they directly told me that whether i will book ivf first or would like to do consultation sồ ultimately they are not giving any option such as iui, medicines etc.From there onwards i decided that i have choosed a wrong hospital ***** **** ***** ***** ****** ******* ******** ***** ******* ** * **** *** ********* *********** ***** *** **** ** *** ***** *** *** ***************** ******* ********* *** *** ******* **** ** ** **** ********* ***** ** **** ******** **** *** ******* **** **** **** *** ******* ** *** **** ****** *** ******* ****** ********* ** ****** **** ********* ******.
