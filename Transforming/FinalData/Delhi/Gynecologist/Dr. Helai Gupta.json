With Dr Helai, the entire pregancy was a smooth ride. She was always available on whatsapp, phone or any mode of communication. She was never in a rush during appointments and listened to us carefully if we had any doubts. She had a solution to all our problems and she always went in length to explain everything with patience.\n\nMy wife had a normal delivery under the guidance of Dr Helai which I guess is unheard of nowadays. The doctor has high work ethics *** *** ***** *** ******* *** *********** ***** ** ********* ****** ******* \n\nI am writing in length, as I want the readers to please choose the right doctor.

She was extremely caring, supportive and kind and helped me sail through these difficult safely.\nMy delivery at Spring Meadows Hospital, East of Kailash, New Delhi was an enjoyable experience.

We brain stormed for a day at Rosewalk on which gynecologist we should choose as there List is endless.\n\nPreviously, we had a very bad experience with a senior gynecologist at a reputed hospital in Delhi (don't want to Name any), hence this time we did not want to take any risk in choosing the right gynecologist. \n\nI can assure you that Dr Helai is the best gynecologist in Delhi. With Dr Helai, the entire pregancy was a smooth ride. She was always available on whatsapp, phone or any mode of communication. She was never in a rush during appointments and listened to us carefully if we had any doubts. She had a solution to all our problems and she always went in length to explain everything with patience.\n\nMy wife had a normal delivery under the guidance of Dr Helai which I guess is unheard of nowadays. The doctor has high work ethics *** *** ***** *** ******* *** *********** ***** ** ********* ****** ******* \n\nI am writing in length, as I want the readers to please choose the right doctor. Initially it was a very tough task to get the right gynecologist, but somehow we landed on the right page with Dr Helai by God's grace.",

I don't have a medical background but Dr. Helai made the explanations of medical procedures so simple to follow. Moreover, she has always taken the time to address every concern of mine. She has always encouraged me to ask questions as she has told me on different occasions that the patient should be informed about their health so that they have the information to take health related decisions with all essential information available. I really respect that approach. After meeting with Dr. Helai, I have also encouraged my friends and family members to get routine checkup by gynaecologists.",
