So it is very helpful at this time to have good support, especially on the healthcare front especially from the doctors. Certainly, one has multiple options to select from, to go to any kind of facilities available in the city and we are happy we chose ***The healing touch Maternity centre***  for our baby\u2019s arrival. The reason was very simple - I had really good feedback for the facility as well as the doctor and our experience was also amazing when we visited the clinic for the first time. When we met ***Dr Mani Kapoor*** we were pretty confident from the first consultation itself that we are in the right hands. Theses 9 months are definitely not easy and it has almost been a roller coaster with so many ups and downs and mostly downs. We used to panic and would get depressed at times and that is when the immense support from the doctor and her team made us feel most comfortable. So our overall experience has been very good as we have always got all the care, attention and proper treatment at all time.\u201cMy experience has been awesome. The services have been very nice, everyone from the housekeeping to the nursing staff has been very kind and helpful. The doctors are amazing and give a lot of confidence and have a very positive attitude, so well and would never let us panic. Dr Mani Kapoor certainly is an amazing doctor and even 5 minutes with her can make you feel so much at ease and she gives support at every step throughout the pregnancy. We feel really grateful that we chose to deliver at ***The Healing Touch Maternity Centre*** .\u201d \u00a0Ms Mamta Solanki",

A fantastic human being who understands your problem without being judgemental and also makes you understand in detail about your health issues.  I was able to concieve in 2016 because of her encouragement and support and 9th of July 2017, I have delivered a healthy baby girl. Throughout my pregnancy, Dr Mani Kapur has been a constant source of motivation and support. Being 37 years of age with weight issues, I was baffled with managing  my weight throughout my pregnancy. Under the constant guidance of the doctor, I was able to put on only limited amount of weight with proper diet management and regular walks. I would like to make a special mention of the emotional support offered by the doctor, you can confide in all your fears and that makes the doctor - patient relationship all the way more comfortable. Additional advantage is lesser waiting time (less than 15 minutes) when visiting the doctor. Overall a great satisfying experience and its more like having a great friend for a lifetime :) !!   ",

She was very calm and polite about the delivery no matter how scared the family was about it. When she came out of the OT, it was very calming for all of the family members.\n \nOverall, it was a very comfortable experience and stay for all our family members, from little kids to oldest members, it was enjoyable too. \n\nSo we thank you for making this delivery memorable and happy one.\n\nIn canteen, they were quick in providing orders and were helpful at all times. The canteen staff was polite too. \n\nWaiting area being the most important part for the family as they require a little comfort if they have to sit for hours, was perfect, absolutely comfortable sofas and enough for all the members of the family. \n\nStaff members and all nurses were very polite and helpful too in case of anything, and did not hesitate in doing their work. \n\n",

I was taking treatment from other hospital since 7 months.It was all going smooth till 7 months.   They advised sugar and bp pills, but sugar level is near to normal, Dr. Mani Kapur advised me not to take pills as this is over treatment for my wife, we want a normal delivery and according to dr weight was a big issue as normal can't be done above a particular range. I visited twice before delivery and now on d day of delivery, my wife came back from office safely, at 6:30pm we visited The Healing Touch because of pain and I don't know what  magic she had done at 8:04pm she came out of delivery room and told us that it's a baby boy, both are good, * ***** *** ** * **** ************* * **** **** **** ** ** **** I suggest everyone to visit atleast once if you are in any doubt, she will make you feel so easy and comfortable. The staff is also very cooperative and humble,I thanx to all nurses who gathered around my wife for more than two hours before delivery making her calm down and relaxed. I would say it's a perfect place to get your baby delivered. Thanx to healing touch.",

So it is very helpful at this time to have good support, especially on the healthcare front especially from the doctors. Certainly, one has multiple options to select from, to go to any kind of facilities available in the city and we are happy we chose ***The healing touch Maternity centre***  for our baby\u2019s arrival. The reason was very simple - I had really good feedback for the facility as well as the doctor and our experience was also amazing when we visited the clinic for the first time. When we met ***Dr Mani Kapoor*** we were pretty confident from the first consultation itself that we are in the right hands. Theses 9 months are definitely not easy and it has almost been a roller coaster with so many ups and downs and mostly downs. We used to panic and would get depressed at times and that is when the immense support from the doctor and her team made us feel most comfortable. So our overall experience has been very good as we have always got all the care, attention and proper treatment at all time.\u201cMy experience has been awesome. The services have been very nice, everyone from the housekeeping to the nursing staff has been very kind and helpful. The doctors are amazing and give a lot of confidence and have a very positive attitude, so well and would never let us panic. Dr Mani Kapoor certainly is an amazing doctor and even 5 minutes with her can make you feel so much at ease and she gives support at every step throughout the pregnancy. We feel really grateful that we chose to deliver at ***The Healing Touch Maternity Centre*** .\u201d \u00a0Ms Mamta Solanki",

A fantastic human being who understands your problem without being judgemental and also makes you understand in detail about your health issues.  I was able to concieve in 2016 because of her encouragement and support and 9th of July 2017, I have delivered a healthy baby girl. Throughout my pregnancy, Dr Mani Kapur has been a constant source of motivation and support. Being 37 years of age with weight issues, I was baffled with managing  my weight throughout my pregnancy. Under the constant guidance of the doctor, I was able to put on only limited amount of weight with proper diet management and regular walks. I would like to make a special mention of the emotional support offered by the doctor, you can confide in all your fears and that makes the doctor - patient relationship all the way more comfortable. Additional advantage is lesser waiting time (less than 15 minutes) when visiting the doctor. Overall a great satisfying experience and its more like having a great friend for a lifetime :) !!   ",

We \"Bhawna n Rahul\"present our great gratitude towards you n your staff at The Healing Touch.\n\nDr. Mani was the most helpful doctor in our stay of 3 days. She was very calm and polite about the delivery no matter how scared the family was about it. When she came out of the OT, it was very calming for all of the family members.\n \nOverall, it was a very comfortable experience and stay for all our family members, from little kids to oldest members, it was enjoyable too. \n\nSo we thank you for making this delivery memorable and happy one.\n\nIn canteen, they were quick in providing orders and were helpful at all times. The canteen staff was polite too. \n\nWaiting area being the most important part for the family as they require a little comfort if they have to sit for hours, was perfect, absolutely comfortable sofas and enough for all the members of the family. \n\nStaff members and all nurses were very polite and helpful too in case of anything, and did not hesitate in doing their work. \n\n",

I was taking treatment from other hospital since 7 months.It was all going smooth till 7 months.   They advised sugar and bp pills, but sugar level is near to normal, Dr. Mani Kapur advised me not to take pills as this is over treatment for my wife, we want a normal delivery and according to dr weight was a big issue as normal can't be done above a particular range. I visited twice before delivery and now on d day of delivery, my wife came back from office safely, at 6:30pm we visited The Healing Touch because of pain and I don't know what  magic she had done at 8:04pm she came out of delivery room and told us that it's a baby boy, both are good, * ***** *** ** * **** ************* * **** **** **** ** ** **** I suggest everyone to visit atleast once if you are in any doubt, she will make you feel so easy and comfortable. The staff is also very cooperative and humble,I thanx to all nurses who gathered around my wife for more than two hours before delivery making her calm down and relaxed. I would say it's a perfect place to get your baby delivered. Thanx to healing touch.",

Infact this information arrived to us as a big surprise as I went through a very major laproscopic myomactomy surgery for a 15 cm fibroid 8months ago from AIMS where doctor clearly mentioned us that it is difficult to concieve naturally in my case.The services were really good at\nDr Mani Kapoor's that one can trust\nthroughout your pregnancy. Dr Mani Kapoor handled my case very efficiently and now I am blessed with a\nbaby girl after 37weeks of pregnancy\nthrough C section . DR Kapoor guided us really well throughout my pregnancy and even the staff is super cool and helpful. The ambience of the nursing home is very homely. I will\nsuggest the expecting mothers to visit Healing touch for a better experience.",

Now after 15 years,I had severe bleeding during periods for which I underwent D&C at near by hospital due to kids exams.  But I was not satisfied with their services. I went to Dr Mani again who suggested removal of uterus which I underwent before 3 days. Today I am  perfectly  good in health and  getting  discharged.  I am thankful to  Dr Mani  and  whole  Healing  Touch team for taking good  care of  me . No  one can give the 'Healing  Touch ' that Dr Mani gives",

She stitched her episiotomy under anaesthesia.  \nSo that my wife had a very smooth recovery. I would highly recommend her.\n\nThanks.\nNeety singh\nAlok singh",

Her behavior towards my pregnancy journy of around nine months was very excited and I never fill any kinds fear due to her expert suggestion and   her friendliness nature. I never realised as am talking to a doctor. She will be easily reachable on her mobile at any time. I believe she is not just practicing, she enjoying her profession with her helping touch. I am overwhelmed to have gynecologist like her. Anyone can faith on her blindly, specifically during pregnancy. I am totally happy with her treatment and care. Appreciate her help.. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

She never makes you feel anxious which I have heard and seen at other places. She was available even in the odd hours .She arranged the pre natal classes as well to guide us throughout .I must say no one should think twice  before visiting her for her pre and post delivery care.\nI am thankful for the entire Healing touch staff as well for their care, support and concern they show towards each patient.",

This time my pregnancy was little critical as there were symptoms of premature delivery but with the Guidance of Dr. Mani I was able to complete 36 months successfully when the baby was delivered. special mention for staff of healing touch as I have never seen such a trained/supportive/helpful and polite staff where post delivery even in the absence of Mani mam each staff members were available to provide best care to Mother and Newborn.I highly recommend Dr. Mani and Healing touch to everyone.

It was like now we reached at the right place. She is a doctor who is available 24*7 ( literally 24*7). She replies to each and every query as soon as possible day and night. She is truly a professional doctor with caring, loving motherly personality. She is so  concerned about her in this pandemic times that i have never seen more than 2 patients at one time. The online exercise classes given by her are so helpful during pregnancy. Also the staff at the healing touch is so good working selflessly day and night. I recommend this doctor.\nThank you!",

As a result of that I am blessed with a baby boy and I am so happy to share the story on this platform!  Dr Mani and her team was always very helpful with a warm smile on the face that all my fears went away .. I want to thank Dr Mani and her staff for immense support they gave me throughout .",

I had previous 2 miscarriages & I conceived third time with treatment by Dr Mani Kapur .As such ,everything was good till 20 weeks when I came to know on ultrasound that the mouth of my uterus is open and can't hold the baby further. We were in distress and got admitted at Healing Touch under Dr Mani Kapur. With  her treatment and care, I prolonged this pregnancy for further 82 days ! and we were blessed with a baby boy on 4/3/23. Today we are getting discharged from hospital but I am getting emotional as if I am going from  my home. Here, Dr Mani and all the staff took care of me so well that I felt as if I mam at home .All my thanks to Dr Mani Kapur and her team for this difficult and miraculous case she handled so perfectly. You are  in safe hands if you are  at Healing Touch.\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70",
