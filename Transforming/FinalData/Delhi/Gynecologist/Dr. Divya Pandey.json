First time itself the attitude of the doctor was so friendly and helpful that we were amazed. She was so detailed in her explaination of issues and treatment that we became very comfortable. \nAfter some time we had an unplanned pregnancy and visited Doctor regularly for that. During the pregnancy, my wife was having a lot of issues related to vomiting, pain, etc. once she fell sick due to flu infection (caused by me) and many other issues were there. My wife was vomiting whole 9 months. The pregnancy was very stressful for us, but whenever we used to visit Dr. Divya, she used to motivate and cheer us with her guidance. It was our first pregnancy and we didn\u2019t know much and we were very annoying also. But dr. was very helpful and she guided us very well.\nIt was to such an extent that she got her empaneled to a hospital at our insistence because we wanted to go for that specific hospital.\nWe are really indebted for her support during the entire process.\nThe C-section performed was also very good (as told by her).\nOverall the experience was not like a doctor but more like an elder sister.\nAll I can say is that I\u2019ll always recommend her, either online channels or personally to my friends also.",
