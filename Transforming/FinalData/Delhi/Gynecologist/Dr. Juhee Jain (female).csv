"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Juhee Jain, believe me, truly is a wonderful Doctor. She treats like a doctor, cares like a mother, advise like a friend and sometimes shows a bit unhappiness, still wanting your well-being like a true mentor does.

After feeling disappointed with several years of treatment and losing all hopes of ever having a baby, we luckily met Dr. Juhee Jain, and the amount of inspiration and positive vibes she gave, we regained our lost hopes from day 1 itself.

Although the treatment was tough sometimes, the Oxygen Therapy and IV drips sometimes made us felt a bit anxious, but she had full faith in her treatment and that worked too.

Along with her knowledge, Dr. Juhee has loads and loads of experience and that exactly is the key to her success. The staff at her clinic is very cooperative and friendly.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,High-Risk Pregnancy Care,",0,0,YES,"Hi, I am Madhu. I had 3 miscarriages previously. But now I have 8 months pregnancy. I have been taking treatment from Dr. Juhee Jain right from the day my home pregnancy test was positive. She is really a high risk pregnancy specialist. She is very friendly. The one thing I found it is very convenient to take treatment from her. All tests are done at the clinic. The reports come to the doctor directly. We don't need to collect the report and then go to the doctor.
