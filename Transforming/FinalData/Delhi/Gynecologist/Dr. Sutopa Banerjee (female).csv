Dr Sutopa is a doctor with a magical touch. She is a brilliant medical professional and by nature she is very understanding and treats her patients very calmly and in a friendly manner. We have been consulting dr Sutopa since last 7years and since then , there has been no looking back. She has always been extremely supportive of our decisions and has always guided us with best possible solutions to our gynaec problems . 

My pregnancy journey started with few ups and downs as there were some complications. But dr sutopa guided me at every step of my pregnancy journey and helped me deliver a beautiful and healthy baby boy 2 months back and I cannot be more than grateful to dr Sutopa for making it happen so smoothly. 

We started with dr Sutopa from the day we started planning for a baby. She asked us to take few tests and also guided us to take pre-conception plan from curelinks . This really helped us conceive within 2 months of our visit to dr Sutopa. Once we conceived , we blindly followed her and did whatever was required to deliver a healthy baby. She was very polite and was always available on call to help us with smallest of the doubts. 

Her infectious smile is all that a person would need to make them feel good. After knowing her for so long, she is like a family to us and treats me like her sister . She has always been supportive and I can't think of anyone else for my gynae problems. I have even recommended her to my friends and family. All you need to do is trust her and she will take care of the rest.

We would like to extend our sincere thanks to mam and her team of doctors and support staff for giving us the most happiest and special moments our life .. May God bless you with good health and happiness and may you remain the source of happiness for many others just like us .

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Banerjee is really very good in Her work. 

Me and my Wife's journey to become parents started in Feb, we rushed to nearest Gynecologist i.e. Nanda hospital Chhaterpur. Doctors in that hospital are really
good but we wanted someone that could provide us help and guidance in this journey off the clinic/hospital too whenever we are in need. I was really worried about
it and then I used Practo to find nearest gynecologist and shortlisted two but chose Dr. Sutopa due to her details and patient feedback. Obviosly not all feedbacks
are good but lets be honest one or two reviews doesn't help you pick or drop.

So we visited her then she explained things very nicely, we didn't have to ask her anything, it is like with her experience of more than 2 decades she know what 
could be the psyche of patient and what are their most probable concerns. With her first consulation we were happy but going forward I saw that she is writing many 
tests at every stage and also used to prescribe many medicines, at this stage you might discuss this with your friends and family, some of them surely will say this 
doctor is doing this for monetary benefit blah blah but trust me you need to TRUST Dr. Banerjee because this is what we did at every stage.

Like most of the people we also wanted Normal delivery but we will be honest we did not have too much confidence because my wife's pain threshold is very low and when 
due date was nearing we used to discuss this to make up our mind so that when time comes we don't get nervous or demotivated. We discussed this with doctor and she told us
we can decide if we want but we will wait till 40 weeks for normal delivery unless there is any complication found, and at this point i would like to highlight that she has
no agenda other than making sure Mother and Child both are safe and healthy. So if takes to write multiple tests or to prescribe medicines for mother, that looks
money making agenda to some people, she will do that. She is really SOFT SPOKEN and KIND but she wont let you take her lightly when comes to patient care. 

After waiting for 34 weeks there was Preterm labor and we were not happy because that means Mother and baby both will have to suffer but Dr. Sutopa made it go away
with immediate hospitalization of my wife and 2days of care, by the way she operates and delivers baby in Fortis hospital Vasant Kunj. And after waiting 3 more
weeks i.e. in 37 weeks 4days time came and we reached hospital and she saw my wife in labor and she knew about her pain threshold so she prescribed Epidural to ease with labor
but did not chose to do C-Section and with all these we saw our beautiful Girl Child and we were too happy as our WISH came TRUE.

Dr. Sutopa Banerjee my gynecologist showed up for me like an angel. Who made my experience at Fortis Hospital Vasant Kunj a wonderful one.
Dr. Sutopa and her team are doing a great job at Fortis. Everyone was at their best, Dr. Sutopa is magical, no words to thank her enough. 
Also her PA is doing good work. The Labor room team, the nurses and the supporting staff all did their best, and are very professional.

I was happy with their services and returned home with my bundle of joy. 

Pregnancy Journey: 
My pregnancy journey was going smoothly until the 37th Week, everything was looking fine. I was very excited and fully prepared for the normal delivery. However, things changed overnight, we discovered on the 37th Week blood test, that I have a high risk pregnancy and I need to bring my baby out as soon as possible. As unexpected, not sure how to handle the situation, we were clueless on what action to take forward. Super stressful moments as my countdown was on. 
We re-discussed  the same with Dr. Sutopa. where she explains the current reality, possible circumstances, and available options and their possible 
consequences.  which certainly helped us to make the right decision at the right time. 

When I was in the Operation Theater I was extremely scared until I saw Dr. Sutopa. Everyone may have their own experiences of her. But for me the Aura that she carries to her profession is extreme - 
She stood there and did my delivery & operation just like a DEVI would have done. 

My family and I would like to sincerely thank Dr. Sutopa Banerjee and her team for their wonderful work.

She is extremely polite and friendly. She responded to each and every questions (no matter how silly it was :P) during face-to-face consultation or on whatsapp.

In my case, initially she wanted to wait for normal delivery but things became a bit critical at the end of my pregnancy. It was already full term and could have ended up in a bad way. Dr. Sutopa took the right call and suggested for immediate admission for a complete day for monitoring. We are blessed with a healthy baby girl and all thanks goes to her only. She is now helping me with post-pregnancy care as well.

Finally we are really thankful to all the staffs in the clinic. They are also extremely helpful. they guided us from booking appointments, to getting the medicines or getting the blood tested and it's all under one roof which made everything very easy for us. The clinic is tidy and clean.

Honestly, we have no words to explain, how much grateful we are to her. 

So thank you so much again, Dr. Sutopa, for making our dream come true. We highly recommend her for Obstetrician/ Gynecological issues.

We are thankful to Dr. sutopa mam for making our dream come true. During our difficult phase of life we have met lot of gynecologists but sutopa mam is exceptionally different no doubt she is the best among all of them.
During first consultation with mam, we were afraid and have lot of questions in mind she politely listened with patience and examine reports of past history. As it is a case of high risk pregnancy mam tackle our case with highest level of safety with all precautionary measures. She is extremely polite, soft-spoken and treats her patients like his own child. She is dat much worried as we are till the things become normal. After 6 months of pregnancy when there are no such complications mam still always keep an eye on each and everything and guide accordingly. 
Mam has such a pleasant smile  and soft spoken nature that once u meet her u will start feeling positive and complications will go on its own. At clinic everything is systematic and well managed. Mam will never hurry you u can ask as many questions u have in ur mind. U can only leave once u r completely satisfied and want to go out on ur own. 
During covid time when no doctor wants to investigate u physically she is d one who care for his patients and investigate u (if reqd.) by wearing all protective equipment’s.
We are extremely satisfied and happy with kind of treatment and care we got from Dr. sutopa mam till we got our sweet princess in our hand. We highly recommend Dr. Sutopa Banerjee especially for high risk pregnancy as an Obstetrician-gynecologist.

All thanks to Doctor Sutopa Banerjee and her team. 
 
With experience of my pregnancy, I learnt that the three most important people during the pregnancy are parents to be and doctor. So strongly advise to the couples to spend good time and energy in selecting the doctor. But once you select the doctor, start trusting him/her for the best result.

Like most of the parents, we also wanted to have normal delivery and did lot of research in selecting the doctor.

After first few visits of the Dr. S. Banerjee, I came to understand that doctor plays important role in mode of delivery (only after mother), but it's further depends on many other factors of pregnancy. So best we can do is give our honest efforts and make best possible decision in various situations during the different phases of pregnancy.

Dr. S. Banerjee has strong hold on the subject. She listened all the concerns patiently and offered different options for what I could do. It happens too often that doctors make patients feel trapped into one decision, this was not the case with Dr. S. Banerjee. I really felt in control over the situation and was able to use her as an educated resource to help me make the best decision possible. 

One of many quality of Dr. S. Banerjee is she speak to the point and on right time which is very effective and helped us.

During my visits, I found that the staff is also very helpful and care a lot about patients.

Thereafter, journey of 9 months remained easy under expert guidance and supervision of Dr. S. Banerjee. Only thing I did was stayed positive, stress free and religiously followed the Doctor’s advice.

Under her supervision I had undergone a laparoscopic surgery for ovarian cyst and that has helped me come out of the fear of surgery.

She has always guided me for going through normal procedures for pregnancy. There were certain complications in my first trimester for which I was put on bed rest for 2 months. Doctor made sure that I was following all the medication and treatment properly. The best thing that I like about her is that she’s always available on phone for any query or issues that you face. At times she would have called on her own after seeing the test reports advising what needs to be done.

The 9 months of pregnancy is a wonderful yet very difficult journey when anxiety levels reaches the peak as most of the things are not known to you. With the guidance of Doctor who always cheered me up to smile and remain stress free, I was able to deliver my first child without any complications.

Her staff is also very courteous and humble especially Shravan, Pinky and Sandhya. The clinic visit was so regular, almost twice a week for injections, follow up but they took care of me like an extended family member and made me feel like home.

Her medical advice has been sound from the get-go, and her calm demeanor even when I contracted COVID-19 in April, helped me stay calm right through. Any time we were faced with a slightly complicated situation, Dr.Sutopa took the time to decide what she felt would be the best course for both me as well the baby, without just rushing into anything, and this only increased our level of confidence in her advice.

Dr.Sutopa has been a friend and guide while being wholly professional and extremely competent, and that isn't a very easy balance to maintain.

Too good to be true, but under her planned guidance, i conceived within a month of trying.

We consulted all highly recommended gynaecologists for my mother as her case was very complicated because her surgery was pending for years and had caused a lot of complications because of which a laproscopy couldn’t be performed. Getting this done during the times of covid was another challenge as the availability of resources in hospitals was limited. 

When my mother met Dr. Sutopa, as scared as she was, Dr. Sutopa showed a lot of compassion, understanding her situation and made her feel confident about going through this process. So we finalised this is the doctor she feels safest with.

When the surgery started, there were more complications than what we expected and Dr. Sutopa handled the situation with utmost diligence and care. The surgery lasted longer than we expected and unforeseen circumstances arose. During the surgery, my mother’s urine bladder got bruised(which happens often) and the doctor did her best and responded to the situation immediately and had other doctors onboard.

	Finally, on 04 May 2020 at about 1453 hrs, I was very smoothly operated by Dr Sutopa and got a lovely Baby (Boy).

As per records, you visited me 1st time 6 months back , perhaps based on reviews, had treatment from me and got well. I doubt if that time you recommended me to anyone for the good treatment that I gave you or gave a positive review to help others find a good doctor.
The second time you visited me 6 months later for treatment for a new episode of problem , as anybody else would do if only one had a good experience with me and not jut because of mere reviews. Had you not liked my treatment earlier you wouldn’t have visited me again I presume.
A mere consultation fee and 2 culture tests which were necessary for your diagnosis has burnt your pocket and has put a question mark on a doctor’s intentions of curing a patient.
