We met Dr Poonam in January this year for treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease. My condition was misdiagnosed by a renowned doctor as genital tuberculosis. I was put on TB medicines, but within a week instead of getting better my health started detoriating. We then consulted a TB specialist who told us that the medicial evidence is not suggestive of TB. He then referred us to Dr. Poonam. On our 1st meeting with Dr. Poonam, mam gave us half an hour to listen to out entire story, saw all our reports patiently.  She then gave me medicines for 1 week to treat the inflammation in my pelvic organs. And after a week, the ultrasound report came perfectly fine. I was cured. I would also like to mention that we were trying for a baby since one and half years before visiting Dr. Poonam. And, in April this year i.e. 2 months after getting treated for PID, I conceived. My pregnancy journey was very smooth thanks to Dr. Poonam. She used to address all sort of questions I asked, used to attend our calls even at odd ours and was always approachable on whatsapp as well. She is very lively in nature, always smiling and treats her patients with utmost sincerity and patience. Even in my pregnancy I faced some issues like high bp, cholestasis but all these were handled very efficiently by Dr. Poonam. My delivery was also an emergency c section at odd hours and Dr. Poonam reached hospital within half an hour. So I would highly recommend Dr. Poonam to everyone. And I really want to thank you mam from the bottom of my heart. Doctors like you are hard to find but thank God we found you. ",

My mother needed laparoscopic surgery, which can be a nerve-wracking procedure. However, from the very beginning, Dr. Poonam Agarwal put us both at ease with her calm and reassuring demeanor.\n\nOne of the things I appreciated most about Dr. Poonam Agarwal was her ability to explain everything in detail. She took the time to make sure we understood the procedure, the risks involved, and what to expect during and after the surgery. This helped us feel more prepared and less anxious about the whole process.\n\nThe surgery itself went smoothly, and my mother's recovery was faster than we had anticipated. Throughout the process, Dr. Poonam Agarwal was always available to answer any questions we had and address any concerns we raised. She has a very caring and empathetic approach, which made us feel like we were in good hands.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Dr Poonam Agarwal to anyone looking for a knowledgeable, compassionate, and skilled gynaecologist. Her expertise and professionalism are unmatched, and she truly goes above and beyond to ensure her patients receive the best possible care. Thank you, Dr. Poonam Agarwal, for all you've done for my mother - she's doing great now thanks to you!",

We met Dr Poonam in January this year for treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease. My condition was misdiagnosed by a renowned doctor as genital tuberculosis. I was put on TB medicines, but within a week instead of getting better my health started detoriating. We then consulted a TB specialist who told us that the medicial evidence is not suggestive of TB. He then referred us to Dr. Poonam. On our 1st meeting with Dr. Poonam, mam gave us half an hour to listen to out entire story, saw all our reports patiently.  She then gave me medicines for 1 week to treat the inflammation in my pelvic organs. And after a week, the ultrasound report came perfectly fine. I was cured. I would also like to mention that we were trying for a baby since one and half years before visiting Dr. Poonam. And, in April this year i.e. 2 months after getting treated for PID, I conceived. My pregnancy journey was very smooth thanks to Dr. Poonam. She used to address all sort of questions I asked, used to attend our calls even at odd ours and was always approachable on whatsapp as well. She is very lively in nature, always smiling and treats her patients with utmost sincerity and patience. Even in my pregnancy I faced some issues like high bp, cholestasis but all these were handled very efficiently by Dr. Poonam. My delivery was also an emergency c section at odd hours and Dr. Poonam reached hospital within half an hour. So I would highly recommend Dr. Poonam to everyone. And I really want to thank you mam from the bottom of my heart. Doctors like you are hard to find but thank God we found you. ",

My mother needed laparoscopic surgery, which can be a nerve-wracking procedure. However, from the very beginning, Dr. Poonam Agarwal put us both at ease with her calm and reassuring demeanor.\n\nOne of the things I appreciated most about Dr. Poonam Agarwal was her ability to explain everything in detail. She took the time to make sure we understood the procedure, the risks involved, and what to expect during and after the surgery. This helped us feel more prepared and less anxious about the whole process.\n\nThe surgery itself went smoothly, and my mother's recovery was faster than we had anticipated. Throughout the process, Dr. Poonam Agarwal was always available to answer any questions we had and address any concerns we raised. She has a very caring and empathetic approach, which made us feel like we were in good hands.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Dr Poonam Agarwal to anyone looking for a knowledgeable, compassionate, and skilled gynaecologist. Her expertise and professionalism are unmatched, and she truly goes above and beyond to ensure her patients receive the best possible care. Thank you, Dr. Poonam Agarwal, for all you've done for my mother - she's doing great now thanks to you!",

But due to the current scenario I was very worried & sceptical about visiting a hospital and consulting a Gynaecologist. \nDr. Poonam Agarwal was really instrumental in giving my mom the initial trust and confidence about the surgery. She was very kind & listened to my mom's queries patiently. She also paid attention to all my concerns calmly pre and post surgery. \nPost surgery, on the follow-up days, she gave the same attention to detail as before and was very kind to reply to all my mom's messages. My mom is recovering quite well from the surgery and we are very happy to have found such an experienced and kind Doctor.\nA big thank you to Dr.Poonam Agarwal from my whole family. \n\n-Aditi Khanna",

But after talking to dr. Poonam , most of our worries had gone because of her such sweet and friendliness nature. My mother had to have her surgery to remove her fibroid sized more than 100 mm.

I had visited 2 doctors before I went to Dr. Poonam. They told me open surgery is the only option, but Dr. Poonam carried out the laproscopic surgery and none of my organs (ovary, fallopian tube) were removed.It was an emotional ride for me and my family,but doctor handled it so well. She answered all our questions patiently and in a very friendly way. She even shared all the details in a very gentle manner without scaring us away. I'm very much thankful to Dr. Poonam. ",
