However I thought I\u2019d take a second opinion with dr Pooja as I was a little worried. She told me to go on contraceptive immediately and even went on to say it has no side effects which we all know on the contrary disrupts your whole system. I was extremely disappointed with my consultation and expressed the same confusion during the appointment without any reassurance or explanation from dr Pooja. I just did a follow up ultrasound on advise of my other gynae and my cyst has disappeared. *** ******* **** ****** ** **** ******** **** * ******* ***** ** ****** *** ***** ******* ** *** ***** ** ***** ******* ** *** ******* **** *** ** ***** ***** *** ***** *** ******** ************ WOULD NOT RECOMMEND HER   ",
