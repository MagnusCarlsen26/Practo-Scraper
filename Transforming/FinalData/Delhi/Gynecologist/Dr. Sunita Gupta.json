The weight gain was so fast and so prominent that my friends and family memebers started getting very concerned and I was sweating profously and loosing hair at an alarming rate as well. I literally gained 12kgs in 15 days even after having a healthy diet and regular excercise. Later I consulted another doctor and found out that she had given me a very high does of testosterone and other hormones which was actually not compatible with my body weight and age. She didn\u2019t even care to warn me about the side effect and didn\u2019t even mention that they were birth control pills. Very disappointed with her. *** ***** *** ** *** *********** *** ********** ** ******* *** **** *******She just wanted to keep the consultation short with out any regard to educating  her patient about their health problems even when the patient is repeatedly asking her about the side effects cause and further treatment.",
