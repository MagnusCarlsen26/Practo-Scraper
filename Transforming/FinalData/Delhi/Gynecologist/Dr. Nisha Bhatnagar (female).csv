I visited the doctor for breast cyst treatment. First day she checked and told me the treatment. I was happy. But then on 2nd day she said that they will have to remove the cyst through surgery and took Rs 6000 for tests. 

On the day of surgery, the cyst came out naturally and surgery was not required. She scared me and my husband that surgery is required otherwise it will become serious issue. I said to clean it and put a bandage and we would think. 

Just for cleaning and putting a bandage she took Rs7500 and with the pen she manually wrote Surgery (I&D). *** ****** ** ** ***** * ***** I WILL NOT RECOMMEND HER.",2021-08-25 07:50:36,False,False,Sugandha Khurana,,,
