She has performed total hysterectomy surgery which I would term as HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL - thanks to my doctor's advice of undergoing latest robotic surgery. She counselled me with the benefits and explained that even though it is marginally expensive, the blood loss during the surgery and pain after it is very less. Now I am happy that I chose to undergo robotic surgery as I had spent only couple of days in the hospital and started my normal life soon after.",
