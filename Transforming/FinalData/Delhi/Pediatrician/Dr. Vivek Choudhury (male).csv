"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",,0,0,NO,Went to dr. Vivek for consultation for my 4.5 mo baby. Found the session totally unhelpful. He was in such a hurry that he dismissed most of my questions and concerns. Any parent will panic if they see their baby's body jittering. He is an expert so things are obvious to him but not for me. But he didn't take time to explain what it is or why. To some query he said baby might be teething. Isn't a doctor supposed to check and confirm it. It was a really disappointing experience after a wait of 1.5 hr at the hospital .  would not ever come back to him. ,2022-12-23 15:42:06,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
