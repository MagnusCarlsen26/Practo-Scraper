                "review_text": "\u00a0First of all, I apologize for that I can't explain enough how Dr. Atul is good enough for us as\u00a0 I'm not a native English speaker.\n\u00a0We are an expat family and were very new in delhi in 2013. I came to know Dr. Atul Chopra through my neighbour's strong recommendations. I needed to know good pediatricians for a general check up and vaccinations. When I met him for vaccination for the first time, He explained well regarding\u00a0 expected results, reactions and medications with smiling n kindness. These actions may be very usuall jobs as a doctor. But as a foreigner who doesn't know how to speak English fluently, it was very thankful something. \nAdditionally.. one experience I was touched is.. That time was just after few months we had settled down in delhi. My son was sick and had a high fever. There were not my family and any friends to ask help and rely on.\u00a0 At the moment I had two pediatricians' s\u00a0 phone numbers. So I sent messages them about my son's symptoms. It was about at 10 or 11pm. But only Dr. Atul sent me messeges and got back to me what and how to do. He was the only one who could help us. I don't know if this is common in India or Indian doctors are like this. (it's unusual in my country.) He tried to support my family who doesn't have reliable helps through difficult times alike as much as he can as a doctor. This is an unforgettable experience for ever. After this happening, my family became a big fan of him. Now when people (who seeks for pediatricians for their child) ask me, i recommend him without any hesitating. \nI have two kids. My kids also like Dr. Atul. He doesn't need to try to relieve my kids's fear of this white gown person or his stethoscope. My kids know how friendly he is. His home clinic which is in gk2 is warm n kids friendly place. He keeps some toys and lets kids play to feel comfortable and ease their fear. His clinic became my kids's play ground(Sorry, dr. Atul). He takes care of kids but also parents s mind by relieving their anxiety. Dr. Atul is more than good enough for my kids n family. I think there are not proper words I can't thank him enough. ",

He is genuinely concerned for children's health and family's health ..and gives excellent advice..my children had been vaccinated at his clinic since birth and never faced any issue. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with an outstanding quality of medical care. Even during covid days, he was always available for online consultation. We are so appreciative of his kindness and expertise. We consult the doctor for any small to big matter and he is always available irrespective of time. As new parents, we are happy and lucky to be connected with a doctor who is more like a friend and available for us when we need him. He is always cool, kind, and friendly to the children as well as parents. I would highly recommend Dr. Atul.",

He is always available for any concerns and follows up enquiring about my childrens' health incase of reaction to any vaccinations, or after a bout of high fever or illness which I have found to be extremely caring and rare amongst any doctor. As a paediatrician he is also very attentive towards the elderly and my parents have accompanied me on many occasions enjoying his warm and friendly presence.\nHis  clinic has an inviting environment and my son enjoys playing with all the toys lying about. He is very informative, explaining things in depth many times. * **** ***** *** ********** ** ** **** ********* without prescribing too many medicines and allowing the body's immunity to strengthen.\nI would definitely recommend anybody looking for a great paediatrician to go to Dr Atul Chopra.",

I came to know Dr. Atul Chopra through my neighbour's strong recommendations. I needed to know good pediatricians for a general check up and vaccinations. When I met him for vaccination for the first time, He explained well regarding\u00a0 expected results, reactions and medications with smiling n kindness. These actions may be very usuall jobs as a doctor. But as a foreigner who doesn't know how to speak English fluently, it was very thankful something. \nAdditionally.. one experience I was touched is.. That time was just after few months we had settled down in delhi. My son was sick and had a high fever. There were not my family and any friends to ask help and rely on.\u00a0 At the moment I had two pediatricians' s\u00a0 phone numbers. So I sent messages them about my son's symptoms. It was about at 10 or 11pm. But only Dr. Atul sent me messeges and got back to me what and how to do. He was the only one who could help us. I don't know if this is common in India or Indian doctors are like this. (it's unusual in my country.) He tried to support my family who doesn't have reliable helps through difficult times alike as much as he can as a doctor. This is an unforgettable experience for ever. After this happening, my family became a big fan of him. Now when people (who seeks for pediatricians for their child) ask me, i recommend him without any hesitating. \nI have two kids. My kids also like Dr. Atul. He doesn't need to try to relieve my kids's fear of this white gown person or his stethoscope. My kids know how friendly he is. His home clinic which is in gk2 is warm n kids friendly place. He keeps some toys and lets kids play to feel comfortable and ease their fear. His clinic became my kids's play ground(Sorry, dr. Atul). He takes care of kids but also parents s mind by relieving their anxiety. Dr. Atul is more than good enough for my kids n family. I think there are not proper words I can't thank him enough. ",

We are presently staying in west Delhi and Dr. Atul's clinic is more than 30 KM away from our residence but believes it's worth the travel. He is genuinely concerned for children's health and family's health ..and gives excellent advice..my children had been vaccinated at his clinic since birth and never faced any issue. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with an outstanding quality of medical care. Even during covid days, he was always available for online consultation. We are so appreciative of his kindness and expertise. We consult the doctor for any small to big matter and he is always available irrespective of time. As new parents, we are happy and lucky to be connected with a doctor who is more like a friend and available for us when we need him. He is always cool, kind, and friendly to the children as well as parents. I would highly recommend Dr. Atul.",

I was recommended to visit Dr Atul Chopra by my son's best friend's mum and I have to say I am extremely happy. We are very fortunate to have met the doctor. He is always available for any concerns and follows up enquiring about my childrens' health incase of reaction to any vaccinations, or after a bout of high fever or illness which I have found to be extremely caring and rare amongst any doctor. As a paediatrician he is also very attentive towards the elderly and my parents have accompanied me on many occasions enjoying his warm and friendly presence.\nHis  clinic has an inviting environment and my son enjoys playing with all the toys lying about. He is very informative, explaining things in depth many times. * **** ***** *** ********** ** ** **** ********* without prescribing too many medicines and allowing the body's immunity to strengthen.\nI would definitely recommend anybody looking for a great paediatrician to go to Dr Atul Chopra.",

My son has developed so much confidence in him that he asks me to talk or take him to \"Atul uncle \" and sometimes 'Atul bhaiya' as Yuvaan calls him, whenever he feels sick... We follow Dr Atul's suggestions regarding Yuvaan's health very diligently and it does wonders for him.... thanks you Doc for all your cooperation... You are truly an ambasador of your profession which involves lot of trust and being a good human being... ",

My kids love going to his private clinic as there are things to play with and  his cheer is infectious. have to drag my kids from there as they think it is also a playground...........that's the environment he has created and kids don't even realize that they have just been treated for an illness.

His injection for vaccinations causes the least amount of pain to the child. \n3. He never prescribes unnecessary medicines. \n4. He explains the cause of illness and effect of each medicine prescribed\n5. Can reach out to him on phone/WhatsApp/ SMS easily in case of emergency \n6. Extremely learned and experienced\n\nIt has twice happened with me, that I have reached out to him once at 10.30 pm at night and once on a Sunday.

I always used to panic the moment my baby coughs or sneezes but he never prescribes nebulization in the 1st or 2nd visit and always tries to make the sickness go with few meds. Kids are also soo comfortable with him. Such a friendly doctor. Trust u Sir. ",
