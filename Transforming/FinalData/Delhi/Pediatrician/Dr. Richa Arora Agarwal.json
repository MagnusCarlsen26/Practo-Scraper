She took the initiative of checking my baby from head to toe including her weight, size etc. \nDr Richa was genuinely concerned about her patient and gave us some important tips which we were not aware of and m sure all parent are not aware as well and they should know. Besides she also gave enough time to us to answer all our questions. I recommend this doctor as one of the best doctor and person in the city. If you reside in Rohini or Pitampura or nearby area, one must visit her for consultation. Her clinic is not very flashy it's simple but the doctor Is super intelligent and highly qualifies & highly experienced.\nFew flashy clinics with doctors we visited in the past, misguide us with baby care but Dr Richa put us on right track with baby care & treatments. She is gonna be our permanent pediatric from now on.\nThank You Doctor for your help & support today.",

She took the initiative of checking my baby from head to toe including her weight, size etc. \nDr Richa was genuinely concerned about her patient and gave us some important tips which we were not aware of and m sure all parent are not aware as well and they should know. Besides she also gave enough time to us to answer all our questions. I recommend this doctor as one of the best doctor and person in the city. If you reside in Rohini or Pitampura or nearby area, one must visit her for consultation. Her clinic is not very flashy it's simple but the doctor Is super intelligent and highly qualifies & highly experienced.\nFew flashy clinics with doctors we visited in the past, misguide us with baby care but Dr Richa put us on right track with baby care & treatments. She is gonna be our permanent pediatric from now on.\nThank You Doctor for your help & support today.",
