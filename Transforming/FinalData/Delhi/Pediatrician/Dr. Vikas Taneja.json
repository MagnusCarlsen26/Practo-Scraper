The registration process needs to speed up because only one person is handling the registration process and the queue consumes lot of time for the same. Other than that I have experienced good hospitality ever since I started visiting here.",

First thing which was very disturbing was the waiting time that is more than 1 hour. Even after taking appointment well in advance we have have to wait for one hour. Then the reception staff told us that the dr. Is busy in icu and will be back in 15 minutes. My baby and my husband both were not well and when the dr. Returned from icu a staff member from the same hospital entered the dr. Room without any appointment with other patient for check up and wasted 15 minutes over there. When we asked the reception staff he misguided us that the person is  going to show just a report to dr. And will be back soon. But ultimately we come to know that the reception staff was partial towards there staff person and  even they ask for a apology at end for the inconvenience. No doubt dr. Taneja is really good he explained everything very clearly. And tell us the root problem to deal with. Really happy and satisfied with his work. But I am very disappointed with the staff behaviour and I am filling written complaint against them in the concerned department.",

First thing which was very disturbing was the waiting time that is more than 1 hour. Even after taking appointment well in advance we have have to wait for one hour. Then the reception staff told us that the dr. Is busy in icu and will be back in 15 minutes. My baby and my husband both were not well and when the dr. Returned from icu a staff member from the same hospital entered the dr. Room without any appointment with other patient for check up and wasted 15 minutes over there. When we asked the reception staff he misguided us that the person is  going to show just a report to dr. And will be back soon. But ultimately we come to know that the reception staff was partial towards there staff person and  even they ask for a apology at end for the inconvenience. No doubt dr. Taneja is really good he explained everything very clearly. And tell us the root problem to deal with. Really happy and satisfied with his work. But I am very disappointed with the staff behaviour and I am filling written complaint against them in the concerned department.",
