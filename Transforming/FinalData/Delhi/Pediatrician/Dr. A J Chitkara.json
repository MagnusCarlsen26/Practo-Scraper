He was not ready to see the earlier reports done in last two months including CT scan, ultrasound , blood reports etc from very reputed hospitals and pathology labs. For the entire duration of 10-15 minutes , he kept on shouting without listening to us. He treated us as we are illiterate and failed to understand that we also understand modern day science and its our ( patients) right to understand the diagnosis and treatment and if it is something very chronic and want to understand the chronic disease which our son was getting treated for and on hearing about his good reputation we are there to take his advice. But he doesn't want to hear anything and just kept shouting and finally wrongly diagnosing our child as he didn't read reports.\r\nA good doctor gone bad and may go worse if doesn't improve.

He treated us as we are illiterate and failed to understand that we also understand modern day science and its our ( patients) right to understand the diagnosis and treatment and if it is something very chronic and want to understand the chronic disease which our son was getting treated for and on hearing about his good reputation we are there to take his advice.

His answers may encourage you to leave his cabin. He just kept on shouting without listening to us. He didn't bother about your concern he thinks whatever he is speaking patient have to obey that without asking any question. He was not even ready to tell me about the purpose of syrup which he was recommending to my 10 months old baby. He used very harsh words to me and my mother in a very first interaction. His tone was just very unpleasant for me. I would not recommend anyone to visit him. I visited him with so much hope and I just returned highly disappointed. ",
