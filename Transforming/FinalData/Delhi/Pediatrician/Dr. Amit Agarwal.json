Since, there was no improvement from existing physician medicines we decided to go for other doctor. After recommendation of my friend, we visited Dr. Amit and after examining the child Dr. Amit explained the reason and time by which child would start showing improvements. I can honestly say that after meeting with Dr. Amit we were very much satisfied that he is a knowledgeable and professional doctor as all his prediction about my child went correct. My child has started showing improvements and I really wants to say big thanks to Dr. Amit for his help during our most difficult times.  ",
