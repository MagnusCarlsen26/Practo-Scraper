He is extremely professional, polite and has an amazing knowledge of his area.\nThe most important thing about a Paediatrician is that you should be able to trust the guy with your baby and that he will always do what is best for the child, something that is rarely seen in the medical profession these days where people just care about the money. \nDr Naveen is one guy you can trust to always do the best for your child. He is very approachable and humble. You will not regret the visit if you take your child there.",
