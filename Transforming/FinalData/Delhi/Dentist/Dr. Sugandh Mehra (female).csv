"Treatment satisfaction,",,0,0,NO,"I had taken my 8yr son for checkup after he started complaining about tooth ache.  She started the checkup only after taking advance payment of ₹600 via Gpay. She inspected and did Couple of x-rays and advised that My son has cavity and the tooth should be extracted as it is a milk tooth and cavity might damage the permanent tooth that is coming down under.  She convinced me to pay advance payment of additional ₹3400 and gave me appointment for next day for the procedure. 

Upon reaching home I explained this to my wife and she suggested for a 2nd opinion. We checked with another dentist *** ***** ********* **** *** ** *** **** **** **** ** *** * ********* ***** *** *** **** ***** *** ** ******* *** **** ******  

We as parents of an 8yr were now really confused between 2 different opinions and line of treatment and we decided to get opinion from a 3rd dentist.
