I had to get done a dental scaling along with a few fillings. This was my fisrt time visiting Dr. Khandelwal and she was very approachable. She understood all my concerns well and paid attention to the details of my case. She was honest and transparent about the treatment and, at the same time, ensured that I didn't feel uncomfortable or embarassed . The apparatus they had in the clinic made it easy for me to see the cause of the problem as well. She was efficient in making a tretment plan for me which was quick and doable. Unlike a few dentists I have consulted before, she did not exaggerate the issue and dealt with everything professionally. This really made me feel at ease. ",
