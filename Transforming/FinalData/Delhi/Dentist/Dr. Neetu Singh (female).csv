"Explanation of the health issue,","Cosmetic/ Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"At Park Clinic, the dentist and staff  are passionate about what they are doing.

At each step of the way, they work with you on your journey to improve your oral health.

I have experienced that they thrive to make the patient as comfortable as possible and make the most difficult treatment sound so easy. This is only because of the expertise which they have acquired with the professional acumen of Dr Neetu. 

One of the top reasons why I call them the provider of quality care is because Dr Neetu and her  team is able to make patients feel calm and comfortable. During discussions it appeared that their goal is to make even the most nervous of patients feel at ease during their appointments.

During each visit, they make a point to equip the patients with the knowledge and information they need to improve and maintain their oral health. Dr Neetu works closely with patients to provide customized treatment plans based on their individual needs. By carefully explaining the benefits of each option, she empowers the patients to make the best decisions for their oral health.
