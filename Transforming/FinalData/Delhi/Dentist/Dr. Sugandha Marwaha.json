The staff is welcoming and nice, most importantly they help my kid relax and have a good experience at the dentist. The clinic is so kid friendly and that makes our visits be fun. I feel like they provided a lot useful information in every one of our visits. Dr. Henna never rushes us, but always explains what is going on with our kid and what\u2019s her recommendations are. Highly recommend this practice, specially if you have little ones who are nervous about seeing the dentist.\n",

I was taken a back wheni was told she needed RCT. But the way they councelled her made her comfortable and she was jubilant.
