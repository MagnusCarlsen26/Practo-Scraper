As of now  half procedure has been done. And I used to think how painful this surgery will be but trust me it was completely painless even after procedure was completed I haven't felt any pain since then.\nThank you Dr rohit.

                "review_text": "I was using removable dentures since last 5 years. Though I was used to them but still they were not that comfortable and removing them daily was a hassle. My son went to Dr Rohit Yadav to enquire for some solution. There he came to know about Implant supported fixed dentures. The mere thought of getting fixed teeth made me super happy. We took an appointment with Dr Rohit and went to properly understand the whole treatment. After all the required scans and tests, the procedure was started for me. After 5 months, I got my own fixed teeth. Believe me, its like I got my natural teeth back. Thank you so much Dr Rohit. God bless you.",

I was hesitant in visiting doctor as I knew the tooth had to be removed. Someone recommended me Dr Rohit Yadav (Maxillofacial Surgeon). I visited him and told him about my fear of tooth extraction. He made me comfortable, explained the whole process and told everything will be taken care of. And believe me, he did what he said. I can undoubtedly recommend anyone to go to him for wisdom tooth extraction without any fear. Thank you Dr Rohit.",

Researched a bit about it and read about something known as implants supported dentures, but wanted to meet the doctor to get clear insight about it. I got to meet Dr Rohit Yadav and visited him at Cusp Dental. He explained me the whole procedure and the number of sittings, the total duration required, the pros and cons. Everything was very clear in his words. We decided to go for implant supported dentures. The best thing was that after the treatment my grandmother got a full set of fixed teeth which were almost like natural teeth and she really enjoys the food hassle free now. Thank you so much Dr Rohit",

I was not prepared and went back with medicines. It healed in some days. But in the last 2 months, it has occurred many times. It was time to get them removed. Again visited Dr Rohit, and got the treatment done. Now I think, why I waited for so long. Thank you Doctor.",
