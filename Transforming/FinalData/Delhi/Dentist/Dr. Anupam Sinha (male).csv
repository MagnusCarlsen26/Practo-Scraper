"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,NO,"I don't normally write any review for any doctor on any public forum, however this experience of mine with Dr. Anupam Sinha calls for one. Though the doctor was very friendly, I had some issues with the way I was treated. 

I visited Dr. Natalia for the first time in this clinic because of some recurring pain in one of my pre-molars. On diagnosis, she advised me to get RCT done. The next time I came after taking her appointment on Practo, I was seen by Dr. Anupam. Though he was not the doctor that I had intended to be treated by (since I had talked to Dr Natalia), I did not object and went ahead with him. 

The first sitting went quite well, almost painless. However, the second sitting was a NIGHTMARE. I was already having slight pain and had informed Dr Anupam about it before the procedure itself. He straight away started with his thing and in spite of telling him MULTIPLE times during the procedure about the pain, that kept aggravating, he did very little to subside it. I could feel some resistance from his side in giving me proper local anaesthesia, for reasons that I am not aware of and are obviously, beyond my reasoning. Orion advertises ""painless RCT"" in their prescriptions, but this sitting was completely opposite. That night I had unbearable pain in that tooth and had to take THREE pain killers to sleep - Ketrorl, Enzoflam and Ultracet.

After getting a tooth-dressing done by him again the next day, I met him for the fourth and the last time after a gap of 5-6 days.

You did in fact make an appointment with Dr Natalia and you were met by her and asked to start root canal treatment . You wanted time to think about it. Sunsequently after a few days when you did get in touch to start treatment dr Natalia had some personal work and asked you if you were ok getting treatment done with another dr before you came for the appointment .It was after your telephonic consent before coming for the appointment that Dr Anupam was assigned for your work.The charges for the root canal was explained to you before starting as Rs 5000 by dr Natalia .. Sometimes during endodontic treatment a flare up can occur especially as it did in you case and as you called up late in the night complaining of pain which wasn't subsiding with regular pain killers and so a more effective one was prescribed so that you could have a restful sleep and you were called for a check up early next morning. Subsequent to this episode the rct was compleated well over the next 2 visits.I hope you understand that due to the Corona virus doctors have to work with a variety of PPE to prevent cross infection . Dr anupam was using a hot instrument in your tooth and it touched your lip inadvertently while working in your mouth with all the PPE and mask. He did apologize for that . It was not intentional . 
Subsequent to the completion of the rct you informed us 3 days later that your tooth was now doing well and had healed and you were ready to make an appointment for the crown. You asked about our crown charges and were again  informed of the charges 7500 rs. After this you decided to write us a bad review. You never communicated your disappointments to us. Charge for the crown after paying for the root canal is normal . We  assure you that these rates are quite standard for the said procedures anywhere in South delhi.
We are sorry that you had an unpleasant experience with your dental procedure we would endeavour to improve our services further. ",2021-01-05T15:23:59+0000,Dr. Anupam Sinha
