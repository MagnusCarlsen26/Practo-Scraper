I had my hesitations, but Dr. Mahima assured me that it very manageable. I sent her pictures from time to to time and she gave her feedback and suggestions.\nNow, I am back and find that almost 75% of the correction is already done !!! That is more than what I hoped for, and I never had to visit a doctor when I was abroad.\nDr. Mahima is always accessible and is very helpful in organising urgent appointments.\nAlso, Dr. Mahima and her staff are incredibly efficient, warm and welcoming !!!\nFinally, in my opinion you can confidently approach Dr. Mahima for all your dental issues and be assured of a perfect treatment.\n",

I had my hesitations, but Dr. Mahima assured me that it very manageable. I sent her pictures from time to to time and she gave her feedback and suggestions.\nNow, I am back and find that almost 75% of the correction is already done !!! That is more than what I hoped for, and I never had to visit a doctor when I was abroad.\nDr. Mahima is always accessible and is very helpful in organising urgent appointments.\nAlso, Dr. Mahima and her staff are incredibly efficient, warm and welcoming !!!\nFinally, in my opinion you can confidently approach Dr. Mahima for all your dental issues and be assured of a perfect treatment.\n",

You had an extremely complicated cracked tooth issue which we not only successfully diagnosed but also treated successfully. As per your crown, we gave you a warranty crown which was fitted by my assistant only because you were not willing to wait for me. I had repeatedly told you that I was unavailable due to a death in the family. It is unfortunate that despite trying my level best to sort out your issue and even refunding your amount, you think it is befitting to malign my reputation. These portals unfortunately speak nothing of the time and effort that the doctor has put in to satisfy you. Wish there was a portal for us to place feedbacks on patients as well.",

Eventually,  all the time & effort was unproductive, have got it re-done from a Prosthodontist. Dr Mahima has refunded the crown money since I didnt have faith to go back to her  for re-doing the process. Doctors esp whose name is on the clinic door need to be more careful since they are not doing themselves a favor by handing over their patients to their assistants without adequate supervision.",
