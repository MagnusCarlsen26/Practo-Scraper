I can really understand your issue.But its almost impossible for a dentist to attend call during treatment time,the phone is generally not in chamber. As i can see my call records after seeing your 5 missed calls i called you back as soon as i got free.. and answered almost all your queries. As far as treatment is concerned for that kindly book an appointment for visiting the clinic. You are most welcome. If you want to call for queries kindly call in clinic off timings i.e. 1 30 pm to 5 pm or after 9 pm. Thanks.",

I can really understand your issue.But its almost impossible for a dentist to attend call during treatment time,the phone is generally not in chamber. As i can see my call records after seeing your 5 missed calls i called you back as soon as i got free.. and answered almost all your queries. As far as treatment is concerned for that kindly book an appointment for visiting the clinic. You are most welcome. If you want to call for queries kindly call in clinic off timings i.e. 1 30 pm to 5 pm or after 9 pm. Thanks.",

My team tried contacting you on the mobile number provided to us but it was never answered.  As you took an online appointment few hours before the appointment time and was not available on the  phone, it was impossible to communicate my leave of absence.  Further, to not to waste your arrival efforts the appointment was squeezed in already tight schedule of another co-owner senior doctor Dr Ruchir, from which you undertook treatment for your cleaning of teeth.  It was also good to know that you had no issues during the treatment which you conveyed to me when I met you personally and I continued your treatment in subsequent appointments.\n\nWe doctors sometimes also fall ill and do take leaves but here in Healthy Smiles Dental Clinic we make sure every patient is still treated with utmost care and highest level of professionalism, because of which you were not sent back and were seen by my husband Dr Ruchir.  Hope we as a team were able help you out in treatment of your issues and would be pleased to treat you in future.\n\nHope it helps.  Cheers!",
