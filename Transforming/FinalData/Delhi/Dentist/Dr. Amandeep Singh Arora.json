Despite the fact that the clinic closing time was 7.30pm, Dr. Aman waited for us and within minutes had extracted the tooth. My daughter felt no pain or discomfort. Their clinic in gk 2 is lovely and I am very pleased with my experience. Dr. Aman is gentle and put my daughter at ease. He is extremely professional and competent. ",
