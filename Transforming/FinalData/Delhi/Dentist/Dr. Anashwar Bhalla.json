The clinic is not only top-notch and equipped with the latest in dental technology, but it also has a welcoming atmosphere that made me feel comfortable right from the start. \n\nDr. Anashwar has a way of making complex procedures seem simple. He took the time to explain each step of my treatment plan, ensuring I understood and was comfortable with what was coming next. His approach is very personalized, and he always considered my concerns and preferences.\n\nThe staff at the clinic are a reflection of Dr. Anashwar\u2019s commitment to excellent patient care. They are kind, attentive, and always went the extra mile to accommodate my schedule and address any anxieties I had about the treatment.\n\nSeeing the results now, I couldn\u2019t be happier. My smile has transformed, and so has my confidence. Choosing Dr. Anashwar was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made for my dental health.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Anashwar to anyone looking to improve their smile. His expertise, combined with his genuine care for his patients, truly sets him apart!",

Thanks to that visit some other issues of cavity, decay under old crown were discovered and treated in time. He is very thorough, pays attention to detail and is not in a hurry to finish.\nI would definetly recommend him to my family and friends. The entire staff is gentle and cultured, hardly any waiting time as it is managed well. Also safe during covid, very spacious clinic, well ventilated. Parking is easy to find.\nFinally, with all the treatment done, I am able to eat normally from both sides after a long long time!",

Our front desk had reached out to you the very next after your procedure  and it was conveyed by you that you were not facing any discomfort.\n3.
