He is also not very transparent about the charges either. Now you will ask how much you will have to dish out for that and he will display a chart that says an X amount. And you will think that's how much I am spending for it. But wait, that's only the token amount. He will keep bringing additional charges for various stages of the root canal process. For instance after 3 visits, he will say something like"" now i will have to insert a fiber support to strengthen your teeth. That will cost an additional 6K or something"". If that was a part of the root canal process that should already have been included in the bill amount.

Anyways, now is the time for crowning. Either you opt for a metallic crown or a ceramic. I opted for the ceramic one with a 5 years warranty. But when it was time for me to get the crown fitted, he said ""the 5 year cover has recently become invalid so I have made the 10 year plan for you. This will cost you 3K extra"". I didn't make much of a fuss about it back then because it was already at the back of my mind to go for the years plan. But still I felt like he should have at least given me a prior update and taken my consent before going ahead with the new plan. What if I wasn't willing to dish away the additional charges? 

Now after almost 3 months I still feel although very minimal but still some kind of a sensitivity in my crowning area. I also opted for deep cleaning. Even here he chose to give a miss to those areas where it's not visible. And now as I got a reminder from Matrix Dental Clinic via Practo for a routine/follow up check I decided to review the place and inform that I don't know about others but ""I am finding another dentist for my future visits"". 

I am still giving it a 2 rather than 1 star because the receptionist was a 
cooperative and sensible lady.
