Dr. Mahima has been highly attentive to me while performing different dental procedures and consequently I hardly felt any ache and discomfort during and after my dental procedures like cavity filling, root-canal & capping treatments, etc. I have always found her listening and carefully understanding the patient\u2019s (mine) problems and then deciding how to go about at ease with the patient\u2019s (my) consent.\nIn my assessment, Dr. Mahima is an efficient professional and she is so humble and caring for his Patient and always give enough time & efforts in explaining the actual condition of the ailment with an effective line of treatment. She never recommended to me medicines/vitamins, etc. more than what is really needed.\n2. I have had many opportunities to observe and speak to medical professionals in various States in India and in various other countries, by virtue of my employment & vacation, and therefore I can safely mention that Dr. Mahima as one of the pioneering and highly proficient professional in her field.\n",

Dr. Mahima has been highly attentive to me while performing different dental procedures and consequently I hardly felt any ache and discomfort during and after my dental procedures like cavity filling, root-canal & capping treatments, etc. I have always found her listening and carefully understanding the patient\u2019s (mine) problems and then deciding how to go about at ease with the patient\u2019s (my) consent.\nIn my assessment, Dr. Mahima is an efficient professional and she is so humble and caring for his Patient and always give enough time & efforts in explaining the actual condition of the ailment with an effective line of treatment. She never recommended to me medicines/vitamins, etc. more than what is really needed.\n2. I have had many opportunities to observe and speak to medical professionals in various States in India and in various other countries, by virtue of my employment & vacation, and therefore I can safely mention that Dr. Mahima as one of the pioneering and highly proficient professional in her field.\n",

It was a a part of my braces procedures, I was very scared of pain and surgery etc. Dr Mahima is the most friendly doctor I have ever met, she gave me enough time even though she had patients waiting, the procedure was painless and she was extremely gentle. I was able to attend work in the evening and was very satisfied over all. Highly recommend Dr Mahima Yadav for painless and most economical dental implants in Dwarka and west delhi.",

Her description truly matched her personality and I have never met a more calm, friendly and sweet doctor. She explained the problem, assessed if I'm eligible for teeth whitening and then gave me all options. I'm seeing at least 2 shades whiter teeth and my photos are already coming out amazing. Very very happy with dr Mahima and sending all my friends to family dental for teeth whitening this wedding season in dwarka.",
