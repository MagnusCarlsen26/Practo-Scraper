I was specifically looking for someone who was highly skilled and could minimize post-treatment pain. That's when I came across Dr. Manish Sharma, who, in my opinion, is a highly qualified and experienced professional.\n\nPrior to Dr. Sharma, I had consulted with several dentists who recommended tooth extraction and sinus lift treatment. Others suggested full mouth rehabilitation. With all these conflicting recommendations, I was left confused and overwhelmed.\n\nFortunately, after two years of searching, I found Dr. Manish Sharma. He not only treated my severely decayed tooth without extraction but also suggested an alternative treatment plan that avoided sinus uplift surgery. This approach greatly appealed to me.\n\nThroughout the treatment process, both during and after the procedures, I experienced no pain and swelling. I was incredibly pleased with the outcome and am grateful to have found Dr. Sharma.\n\nIn addition to his expertise, Dr. Sharma is also incredibly patient-centric. He took the time to explain the treatment plan thoroughly and address all my concerns. He also provided me with valuable advice on maintaining good oral hygiene.\n\nMy experience with Dr. Sharma was nothing short of divine. His expertise, patient-centric approach, and meticulous care made my dental treatment a seamless and comfortable experience. I am truly grateful for his guidance and the exceptional dental care\u00a0he\u00a0provided.\n\nThank God!",

He is one of the most humblest people I've ever met, very soft spoken, takes care of patient's physical and mental comfort.

His guidance helped me a lot to understand the procedure, dental crown and material. \nAppointments were on time.I had some timing issues but he managed my Appointments even on Sundays for that I'm very thankful to him. \nThe cost of treatment is slightly higher side but it is worth the expertise and service he provides. \nNow extremely happy with the results.  Would like to thank Dr. Manish For giving me perfect yet natural smile. I haven't been as satisfied and happy with any other dentist.\nWould completely recommend Dr. Manish sharma if you are looking for any kind of dental problem. \ud83d\ude00 ",

                "review_text": "I had been on the hunt for a good dentist for the past two years, but to no avail. I was specifically looking for someone who was highly skilled and could minimize post-treatment pain. That's when I came across Dr. Manish Sharma, who, in my opinion, is a highly qualified and experienced professional.\n\nPrior to Dr. Sharma, I had consulted with several dentists who recommended tooth extraction and sinus lift treatment. Others suggested full mouth rehabilitation. With all these conflicting recommendations, I was left confused and overwhelmed.\n\nFortunately, after two years of searching, I found Dr. Manish Sharma. He not only treated my severely decayed tooth without extraction but also suggested an alternative treatment plan that avoided sinus uplift surgery. This approach greatly appealed to me.\n\nThroughout the treatment process, both during and after the procedures, I experienced no pain and swelling. I was incredibly pleased with the outcome and am grateful to have found Dr. Sharma.\n\nIn addition to his expertise, Dr. Sharma is also incredibly patient-centric. He took the time to explain the treatment plan thoroughly and address all my concerns. He also provided me with valuable advice on maintaining good oral hygiene.\n\nMy experience with Dr. Sharma was nothing short of divine. His expertise, patient-centric approach, and meticulous care made my dental treatment a seamless and comfortable experience. I am truly grateful for his guidance and the exceptional dental care\u00a0he\u00a0provided.\n\nThank God!",

His guidance helped me a lot to understand the procedure, dental crown and material. \nAppointments were on time.I had some timing issues but he managed my Appointments even on Sundays for that I'm very thankful to him. \nThe cost of treatment is slightly higher side but it is worth the expertise and service he provides. \nNow extremely happy with the results.

He is not just highly clinically talented but also very good with the softer aspects of putting the patient and relatives at ease. We are glad we met him, and got our treatment planned and executed by him. According to us he and his team is one of the best in Delhi! We can say that with confidence, having spent more than a month looking around and meeting umpteen number of doctors before finalising.",

But on the day of the surgery my doctor made everything very comfortable for me. The ambience and music was perfect. Doctor was extremely patient and polite with me. I needed breaks during the surgery and the doctor completely understood my concern and was extremely cooperative. It was a 3 hour procedure but I did not have any stress or tension that I could not bare as they were completely understanding towards my anxiety levels. I had a excellent experience at the clinic and I am very happy with the way the procedure took place. I would definitely recommend this clinic to everyone. And anyone who gets nervous before going to a dentist should just visit this clinic. Also, I forgot to mention I got my front upper tooth crown changed here which was very ugly and long before but after doctor changed my crown I now have a complete different smile and I just love it. I am not conscious about my looks anymore. I would give a 10/10 to the doctor and for the clinic.",
