Dr. Sushan Sharma had explained the procedure before extraction, and He was talking while performing the procedure which made me feel relaxed. I am posting this little bit late, as I wanna tell my complete experience from extraction to recovery. The extraction was done on 16 June 2022, and I felt OK as local anesthesia was given. For the next 2 days I took only ice creams and fruit juices, and started taking mild food thereafter. Usually most of the people gets their face inflammation after tooth extraction, but I didn\u2019t get any inflammation (may be due to my personal immunity). Sutures had been removed on 24 June 2022, doctor said there\u2019s no infection. Due to tooth removal a hole will be formed which will take 30-45 days for complete sealing. So, it\u2019s been 3 weeks and I feel no pain at all, but I am taking complete care so that food particles will not go in the hole.\nI had a better experience with the hospital (Kirpa Dental, West Patel Nagar), and the doctor (Dr. Sushan Sharma). Thank you doc, I feel better now\u2026\nThank you all\u2026\n",

Dr. Sushan Sharma had explained the procedure before extraction, and He was talking while performing the procedure which made me feel relaxed. I am posting this little bit late, as I wanna tell my complete experience from extraction to recovery. The extraction was done on 16 June 2022, and I felt OK as local anesthesia was given. For the next 2 days I took only ice creams and fruit juices, and started taking mild food thereafter. Usually most of the people gets their face inflammation after tooth extraction, but I didn\u2019t get any inflammation (may be due to my personal immunity). Sutures had been removed on 24 June 2022, doctor said there\u2019s no infection. Due to tooth removal a hole will be formed which will take 30-45 days for complete sealing. So, it\u2019s been 3 weeks and I feel no pain at all, but I am taking complete care so that food particles will not go in the hole.\nI had a better experience with the hospital (Kirpa Dental, West Patel Nagar), and the doctor (Dr. Sushan Sharma). Thank you doc, I feel better now\u2026\nThank you all\u2026\n",

He was ready when I visited the clinic. The surgery went around 1 hour and things were done quite smoothly. He patiently performed surgery. After the surgery he recommended some medicines. I have been taking medication and feeling much better. \nThough he cautioned me of pain and swelling however I haven\u2019t felt much of this. \nHe is having high expertise and the way he explains the things in simple manner is phenomenal. \n\nI am a satisfied patient and duly recommend him.",

Dr. made me so calm and when the doctor started the procedure, no pain was felt for one and a half hours. Yes you will feel pressure during the procedure but there will be no pain at all. Throughout the process Dr. calming me too.  Today it's been 1 week and I am fine and no pain. One more thing, after surgery whenever I felt need he was just a call away. ",

At last I was decided to get treated by dr Sushen. and within 1-2 sitting. my RCT was completed.  it was totally painless. and doctor was really freindly. (that was really a comfortable zone for dental treatment in the mid of pandemic, clinic was well sanitized).one thing really like in the behaviour of doctor. he is following the patients condition day by day. he used to ask me about my healing process. that was really a best experience to be treated by dr Sushen and fees also convenient. I was paid only 4500 for this whole treatment.- thank you so much doctor for providing me the best novel for reading. I wish you a happy and healthy life. ",
