Overall I'm not recommending going here, primarily because if the doctor himself is not going to treat completely but handover to someone who is not the face of the clinic, it's not a transparent/healthy practice. Second, the unpleasant behavior of the Junior Doctor is completely unacceptable.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,NO,"Bad experience as a patient. I did root canaling here in 2019 November. I had paid INR 10000 for the crown and was told that there is a 7 years warranty on it. From the very start, I had felt that the fitting of the crown was improper, and my jaw would not close completely. But the doctor told me that it will become okay with time. I regularly brush twice a day, and also floss regularly.

In 2020, the crown came out while I was eating. I never chewed anything hard or sticky, but it came out while having normal food (rice and daal). On consulting the doctor again, he fixed it, and said that it was rare for the crown to come out like this. He also assured me that it should be okay now. But I still was not comfortable with the fitting.

Recently in Jan 2022, the same issue repeated again. The crown came out while having normal food. On reporting again, the doctor said this was happening probably because of sticky food like Eclairs/chocolate. I told him that I never have Eclairs or chocolate especially with this side of my mouth. On asking for a refund, he simply said that unless the crown is damaged, no refund is applicable, and I should just visit a dentist whenever it comes out again. Now I am shifting to Bangalore, and if it comes out again (I know it will), I will again have to pay for the fix. There is no consideration for the hassle I have to face as a patient.

People should avoid this clinic, *** **** ***** ** ****** **** ******",2022-03-27 09:08:51,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
