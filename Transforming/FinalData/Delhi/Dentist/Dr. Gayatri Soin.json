Usually dentists hesitate to treat the 3rd molar as it is not so accessible and advise for extraction but Dr. Gayatri Soin's approach to my problem was very relieving. She saved my tooth and made me painless without harming the tooth. The pricing also was very optimum. \nI liked the friendliness of the doctor as well as the staff and the ambience of the clinic. The sanitization level is also very high.\nI highly recommend Dr. Gayatri Soin's Perfect Smile, old rajinder nagar. ",

And though it was almost closing time for the clinic, she was kind enough to examine me after I told her about the excruciating pain I was having in my wisdom tooth. After a preliminary inspection, she asked me to visit the next day for an X-Ray scan and prescribed some pain killers for the time being. After an X-Ray scan the following day, she suggested me to either go for an RCT or an extraction and I opted for the latter. Initially I was apprehensive of the procedure but she took the time to carefully explain why it was a better choice for me to get the tooth extracted. I went ahead with her advice and everything turned out well. All in all, it was a good experience and I highly recommend Dr. Gayatri for her friendliness and professionalism. I wish her the best. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc ",

She works hard to save as much healthy tooth as possible, often recommending the more difficult fix over the one that's easier for her. I had cavities in my front teeth as well and the work done on them was phenomenal, and looked very real. Dr. Gayatri will not shy away from spending time on a particular patient to get it completely right.The charges for the clinic are higher comparably to other dentists. It cost me on average 1,500 per cavity and 10,300 for the root canal. But, i feel like the effort she puts in is worth it.I've had my fair share of dental treatments gone wrong and am really glad to have found Dr. Gayatri.

I also recommended that you restore the left side of jaw so that you can chew from both sides. you cannot be using one side of jaw ,overstressing it with all your masticatory load and then blame the Dentist. You had a very very high Gag reflex which did not let me maintain Isolation. A lot depends  on your Oral Hygiene as well. I cannot be held responsible for your POOR oral Hygiene. AS for the charges ,I am absolutely justified as there is material cost and Time involved in all the procedures. At times Yes,I may go wrong (as i am a Normal Human Being)  but in that case I have done the re-treatment absolutely free of Cost.  In your case ,I am nowhere at fault. \nAnyway Wishing you Healthy Smiles.\n\nWhen asked for Payment for the treatment rendered,you handed me your visiting card ....trying to scare me that you are an advocate. I have enough documents in my Support.",
