"Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Laminates,",0,0,YES,"

My aligner treatment with Dr. Tania was highly effective in straightening my teeth. Throughout the process, Dr. Tania and her team displayed excellent professionalism, demonstrating deep knowledge and providing courteous service. Communication was clear and timely, with Dr. Tania explaining the treatment plan comprehensively and addressing any adjustments needed along the way. The aligners were generally comfortable to wear, with only minor discomfort initially. The treatment progressed according to the estimated timeline without significant delays. I received thorough support and guidance on caring for the aligners, contributing to a smooth overall experience. I am pleased with the final results of my treatment and would confidently recommend Dr. Tania for aligner treatments.",2024-07-10 12:35:47,False,True,Javed Ali ,,,
