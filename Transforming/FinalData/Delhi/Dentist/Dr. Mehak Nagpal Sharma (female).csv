"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Dental Plaque Removal,",0,0,YES,"I took my 5 year old daughter to Dr. Mehak as she had a cavity and black deposits in a tooth. Dr. Mehak was very friendly and gave around an hour to explain my daughter about all her medical equipments to make her comfortable and that there will be no pain during the procedure. 
She even recited few rhymes to my daughter.

My daughter had visited a different dentist earlier but was so terrified after seeing all medical equipment’s that she started crying and the procedure could not be completed. 
Then later, I came to know about Dr. Mehak through a friend.

I would recommend Dr. Mehek to everyone having kids who don't like visiting doctors specially a dentist. 

I will give her 10 / 10.

Thanks a lot.

"Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,","Paedodontics,",0,0,YES,"My 5 year old son, had been complaining of pain in a premolar. Our visit to Dr Mehak revealed that his tooth was decaying and needed extraction. The procedure was carried out by Dr. Mehak like a great professional but what amazed me more was the amount of patience and concern she has for our children. She gave him all possible chances to throw his tantrums and get over his fear...she did not rush into the surgery, instead even defered the surgery once so that the child does not get phobic of the scene. 
I think she never gives up on her patients of such young age, though chilldren can exhibit horrendous drama in dental clinics. And this us because she is a very good prrson , a young mother hherself and undoubtedly an exemplary professional. 
Post surgery recovery of my child has been exactly as she had explained...my child is happy and healthy.
