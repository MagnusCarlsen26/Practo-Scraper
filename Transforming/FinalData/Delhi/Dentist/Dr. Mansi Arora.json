I lost one of my insular tooth (not sure if that\u2019s the word used for the front tooth) and nobody could fix it. But I guess my in-acceptance of even thinking that I could smile in a better way was proven wrong. And guess what? Dr. Mansi proved me wrong. \n\nI went to her with faded hope and first thing first, I have never seen a doctor so welcoming and investing time into understanding why I had no hopes of smiling freely again. She advised me of the tooth implant and how the implant would work but then I insisted on getting a cap in place. She didn\u2019t deny *** **** *** *** ** ** **** **** * ******** Money absolutely is not what I was concerned about having received such admirable concern and eye to detail to correct the aesthetics which I believed even God would not fix. But she did it.  Now I smile more comfortably though am yet to drain out my subconscious style of smiling that made me think I was ugliest one in the world. And thanks to you Doctor. I can very well guarantee that there is not a single doctor who would understand the pain of the patient the way she does. Medical ailment is all about experience - and my treatment was not less than an experience that I would not forget in my life. \n\nThank you for making me smile again Doctor. I owe it to you, am more confident now and you\u2019re the only one who should be credited with this. \n\nWith love! \nYour patient who didn\u2019t smile at all!\nAvi Anand",

The appointments are slotted in such a way that there will be no 2 patients at one given time. The enforces the COVID 19 protocols.\n\nDr Arora is extremely professional  yet friendly  and was  attentive to my dental issues. She was  thorough in explaining the procedures and calmly answered all my queries. She gave me best advice for my dental problems.   Due to her steady hand  and attention to details during the procedure, I always felt at ease at the dentist's chair.\n\nShe even called and enquired about  well being of me  & my family when I was quarantined due to nCOVID 19. She would also intermittently ask if there is any extreme pain during the treatment. Her empathetic nature  was also  one of the reasons I was confident enough to get treated for all my ailing teeth at her clinic. I went through 3 RCTs with crowns and 1 tooth filling in matter of 2 months due to the same.\n\nAlso the rates for the clinical procedures and crowns are at par with the other top class dentists in the area. She will only recommend the best and won't pursue you to spend extra and unnecessary money on dental procedures.\n\nIt took me a while to find a doctor that made me feel comfortable and welcomed. I wish she was my general physician as well ! Good Luck !\n\nRegards... Shashwat",

After founding good google reviews, met Dr Mansi. She examined the complete situation patiently and explained the next course of treatment. She has re-treated my RCT and in 3 sessions she cured my pain and filled the roots very professionally. She further examined my complete teeth and informed well in advance, possibility of cavity formation at three places. Out of 2 fillings one was very tricky and complicated (below the gums) for which she used the laser. She handled overall treatment in a very professional manner with minimum pain and fast recovery. The quality of crowns which were fixed after RCT was excellent and adjusted immediately. The clinic is wonderful and waiting time is nil with proper appointment. Dr Mansi is very soft-spoken and shows patience with patients. She further suggested cleaning of teeth which was done by Dr Jyoti with complete care and without any pain.\nI found both Dr Mansi and Dr Jyoti very professional and cooperative and I have no hesitation to recommend both of them.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a",

The doctor (Dr. Mansi) really explained me pretty good what was the problem, what was the treatment, time involved & if any problem would be there then what it would be. \nGave me a confidence that the doctor knew very well what she was doing. I had assumed that it would be quite painful procedure but contrary to that the only pain i felt was the prick of the Needle of the injection given for local anaesthetic. After that the doctor was reading my face & everytime i felt uncomfortable she would just stop & wait for me to relax. \nAt the end of the procedure she told me that i will feel pain & she prescribed me some pain killers too. I was really surprised when i got no pain at all. First I felt maybe i was a bit sensitive (a tea spoon of cough syrup keeps me drowsy for 2 days) so local anesthetic stayed longer. Slept well & when i woke up there was no pain at all. This was truly amazing. Only thing that kept me aware that I had an R.C.T. was the feeling of dressing when i closed my teeth shut.\nI went back to the clinic at the time doctor had asked me to come. The premanent filling was done & there has been no problem ever since. \nI seriously don't wish to have a dental problem again but if God forbid I ever have I won't be opting for any doctor other then Dr. Mansi & her clinic \"Dental Care & Cure\".",

Things to note while booking a dentist's appointment: \n\n- Always go to a specialist. She has a post graduate degree (prosthodontist). That is very important. \n\n- The other consultants who visit Mansi's clinic are also qualified for their work. She has ensured that all your dental needs can be covered by her team (the Dental Care N Cure Family) in one clinic. \n\n- COVID is a big issue these days. If you are going for dental treatment, as your respiratory system (mouth & nose) are going to be exposed, you want to ensure safety. When you visit once, you'll realize that she has done everything possible to ensure safety. \n\n- Don't bargain, support local clinics. Local businesses have been hit hard. ",

I lost one of my insular tooth (not sure if that\u2019s the word used for the front tooth) and nobody could fix it. But I guess my in-acceptance of even thinking that I could smile in a better way was proven wrong. And guess what? Dr. Mansi proved me wrong. \n\nI went to her with faded hope and first thing first, I have never seen a doctor so welcoming and investing time into understanding why I had no hopes of smiling freely again. She advised me of the tooth implant and how the implant would work but then I insisted on getting a cap in place. She didn\u2019t deny *** **** *** *** ** ** **** **** * ******** Money absolutely is not what I was concerned about having received such admirable concern and eye to detail to correct the aesthetics which I believed even God would not fix. But she did it.  Now I smile more comfortably though am yet to drain out my subconscious style of smiling that made me think I was ugliest one in the world. And thanks to you Doctor. I can very well guarantee that there is not a single doctor who would understand the pain of the patient the way she does. Medical ailment is all about experience - and my treatment was not less than an experience that I would not forget in my life. \n\nThank you for making me smile again Doctor. I owe it to you, am more confident now and you\u2019re the only one who should be credited with this. \n\nWith love! \nYour patient who didn\u2019t smile at all!\nAvi Anand",

The appointments are slotted in such a way that there will be no 2 patients at one given time. The enforces the COVID 19 protocols.\n\nDr Arora is extremely professional  yet friendly  and was  attentive to my dental issues. She was  thorough in explaining the procedures and calmly answered all my queries. She gave me best advice for my dental problems.   Due to her steady hand  and attention to details during the procedure, I always felt at ease at the dentist's chair.\n\nShe even called and enquired about  well being of me  & my family when I was quarantined due to nCOVID 19. She would also intermittently ask if there is any extreme pain during the treatment. Her empathetic nature  was also  one of the reasons I was confident enough to get treated for all my ailing teeth at her clinic. I went through 3 RCTs with crowns and 1 tooth filling in matter of 2 months due to the same.\n\nAlso the rates for the clinical procedures and crowns are at par with the other top class dentists in the area. She will only recommend the best and won't pursue you to spend extra and unnecessary money on dental procedures.\n\nIt took me a while to find a doctor that made me feel comfortable and welcomed. I wish she was my general physician as well ! Good Luck !\n\nRegards... Shashwat",

After founding good google reviews, met Dr Mansi. She examined the complete situation patiently and explained the next course of treatment. She has re-treated my RCT and in 3 sessions she cured my pain and filled the roots very professionally. She further examined my complete teeth and informed well in advance, possibility of cavity formation at three places. Out of 2 fillings one was very tricky and complicated (below the gums) for which she used the laser. She handled overall treatment in a very professional manner with minimum pain and fast recovery. The quality of crowns which were fixed after RCT was excellent and adjusted immediately. The clinic is wonderful and waiting time is nil with proper appointment. Dr Mansi is very soft-spoken and shows patience with patients. She further suggested cleaning of teeth which was done by Dr Jyoti with complete care and without any pain.\nI found both Dr Mansi and Dr Jyoti very professional and cooperative and I have no hesitation to recommend both of them.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a",

The doctor (Dr. Mansi) really explained me pretty good what was the problem, what was the treatment, time involved & if any problem would be there then what it would be. \nGave me a confidence that the doctor knew very well what she was doing. I had assumed that it would be quite painful procedure but contrary to that the only pain i felt was the prick of the Needle of the injection given for local anaesthetic. After that the doctor was reading my face & everytime i felt uncomfortable she would just stop & wait for me to relax. \nAt the end of the procedure she told me that i will feel pain & she prescribed me some pain killers too. I was really surprised when i got no pain at all. First I felt maybe i was a bit sensitive (a tea spoon of cough syrup keeps me drowsy for 2 days) so local anesthetic stayed longer. Slept well & when i woke up there was no pain at all. This was truly amazing. Only thing that kept me aware that I had an R.C.T. was the feeling of dressing when i closed my teeth shut.\nI went back to the clinic at the time doctor had asked me to come. The premanent filling was done & there has been no problem ever since. \nI seriously don't wish to have a dental problem again but if God forbid I ever have I won't be opting for any doctor other then Dr. Mansi & her clinic \"Dental Care & Cure\".",

My five year old daughter went for the first time with tears in her eyes but by the end of first sitting with Dr. Arora she was laughing and eagerly waiting for her next visit. She gave proper explanation of the treatment required and also treated my daughter like her own saving her from unnecessary pain. I could simply go and relax in her clinic while she worked upon my daughter\u2019s teeth. She truly turns tears into laughter. Will recommend her to everyone.",

Things to note while booking a dentist's appointment: \n\n- Always go to a specialist. She has a post graduate degree (prosthodontist). That is very important. \n\n- The other consultants who visit Mansi's clinic are also qualified for their work. She has ensured that all your dental needs can be covered by her team (the Dental Care N Cure Family) in one clinic. \n\n- COVID is a big issue these days. If you are going for dental treatment, as your respiratory system (mouth & nose) are going to be exposed, you want to ensure safety. When you visit once, you'll realize that she has done everything possible to ensure safety. \n\n- Don't bargain, support local clinics. Local businesses have been hit hard. ",

One of them was treated with filing as it was a minor cavity and had not spread much. The other one, being a major one, had to be treated by RCT. Initially I was apprehensive of cavity pain during treatment, but her treatment procedure was painless and done with perfection which made me comfortable. The best part was that I did not feel any pain after the procedures and continued with my regular diet without any restrictions. Dr Mansi and Dr Jyoti were very friendly and cooperative during their treatment procedures. They also made me aware of proper brushing and flossing techniques in order to avoid further dental health issues.Overall, I would highly recommend Dental Care n Cure to anyone facing dental health problems.

She is very friendly and meticulous, she goes to the root cause of your problem.  She even explains the whole line of the treatment and root cause of the disease to the patient. She even saved my molar tooth ( they are used primarily to grind food during chewing), which I am sure no other dentist could hv saved.  The whole treatment was painless and there was no blood loss in scaling.  They use latest scaling machines and best crowns were used.                                                                     Dr.  Mansi is so far the best dentist I have come across.  I would highly recommend Dr.  Mansi to everybody.  Thanks ",

Her attention to detail is extraordinary, and they possess a keen eye for creating beautiful smiles. Through a comprehensive examination and consultation, she took the time to understand my goals and desires for my smile. She goes out of the way to care for her patients once she offered me her Lunch because she got to know that I came to her without having breakfast and the other when I was feeling uneasy because of the long procedure she offered me to play the music of my own choice. This kind of comfort is very rare.She has an amazing team, special shoutout out to Mukesh who is a very patient and caring helper.",

The patient was well informed about it. \nRegarding the second part of the complaint, the patient was called N number of times for crown fixing. It is a ten mins procedure. The patient did not turn up for one and a half months. The crown could no longer fit because the space for the crown had closed. The only way to fix the same crown in her mouth was to trim the adjacent tooth, which ethically I would not do. It would lead to several problems in the healthy adjacent tooth. If the crown needs to be repeated due to patients appointment cancelations not from  the doctors end, the payment has to be made for the new crown.\nRegards\nDentalcarencure ",
