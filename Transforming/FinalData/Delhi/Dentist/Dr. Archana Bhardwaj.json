B) Qualifications of doctors. C) Relatively new establishment & modern equipment.\nDr Abhishek is a maxillofacial surgeon, so his expertise needs bigger settings. In fact he visits 3 different hospitals for doing surgeries \n(Jaw fractures, oral cancers, TMJ, cosmetic surgeries etc). At Abhirachna clinic, he undetakes RCT, dental implants etc. \nDr Archana is RCT specialist. My RCT was done by her **** ** *** ****** \nThe crown/cap was done by Dr Abhiskek (He also advised some specific precautions &  tips for my particular set of teeth).\nThe clinic itself was clean, quiet & staff was punctual & helpful. Choice of light background music was excellent.\nOverall, both doctors are very cordial, empathetic & always kept me updated about the procedures & treatment. \nAnd thanks to them, I am enjoying toothache free life for last 3 weeks.\nWill definitely visit again for any future dental issues. \n--- Parveen Saini",

Although it\u2019s one hour run from my residence but still worth visiting her for my treatment.

Took a digital X-Ray & explained to me in detail about my problem, their plan of action, expected outcome & approx time/visits & expenditure.\nReasons for choosing Abhirachna dental clinic :- A) Very near to my home. B) Qualifications of doctors. C) Relatively new establishment & modern equipment.\nDr Abhishek is a maxillofacial surgeon, so his expertise needs bigger settings. In fact he visits 3 different hospitals for doing surgeries \n(Jaw fractures, oral cancers, TMJ, cosmetic surgeries etc). At Abhirachna clinic, he undetakes RCT, dental implants etc. \nDr Archana is RCT specialist. My RCT was done by her **** ** *** ****** \nThe crown/cap was done by Dr Abhiskek (He also advised some specific precautions &  tips for my particular set of teeth).\nThe clinic itself was clean, quiet & staff was punctual & helpful. Choice of light background music was excellent.\nOverall, both doctors are very cordial, empathetic & always kept me updated about the procedures & treatment. \nAnd thanks to them, I am enjoying toothache free life for last 3 weeks.\nWill definitely visit again for any future dental issues. \n--- Parveen Saini",

I was told by my family dentist that my rct is difficult so that added my fear.  Then I hunt for female Endodontics. Although it\u2019s one hour run from my residence but still worth visiting her for my treatment. I visited five dentist since two month but at last searched her and took risk to go to unknown dentist. But I was satisfied more than I expected. Reasonable treatment and very caring doctor. \n\nI strongly recommend her for the dental   treatment.  Thanks a lot doctor. ",
