She was able to quickly gain the confidence of the children and her treatment planning as well as exceution has also left me super satisfied. I never imagined children looking forward to going to a dentist but that is the kind of bond Dr. Sony Aunty manages to create with her kid parients. Dr. Sony Mishra is a blessing as a Pedodontist.",

We feel privileged to have made a positive difference to your life. It is also humbling to hear it in as many words from the patient's mouth. We are glad that you were able to identify some of the key elements of our Dental Practice that help us differentiate our clinic and its doctors from so many other options that patients have. We always lay a great emphasis on allowing and helping patients to make their own decisions about their treatment rather than forcing any one thing upon them. Smile Designing or Smile Makeovers is also an art and science that is relatively less explored in Dentistry. We are happy that following our training and so many years of experience handling many different clinical scenarios and varying patient expectations, we are now in a position to deliver them results that keep them happy and satisfied. We wish you well with your career and hope to see you achieving success in all that you do.",

However, the sheer extent of positive impact that Dr. Sony's dental treatment has had on both my personal and professional life, I just could not resist myself from acknowledging her and thanking her for the same. I was quite unhappy with the way my teeth and smile looked and I did not want to go for braces to correct them, as that would have meant sitting without work for at least a year or so. after extensive online research and having been to 4 other clinics in Delhi and 1 in Mumbai, I landed up at Dr. Sony and Dr. Ruchir's clinic. Though their set-up is small (I had the chance to visit their NFC set-up too, which by the way is much more posh and very prettily done up), but their ability to diagnose a problem and then be able to offer multiple solutions for the same is simply amazing. What I really liked is the way they patiently explain the pros and cons of all treatment options, and then help you make the right decision for yourself without any bias or without forcing anything down your throat. *** ****** ******** ****** *** ****** *********** *** *** *** *** ****** ** ********** I underwent Teeth Whitening followed by a combination of Ceramic Veneers and Crowns to correct my smile. I must say I am thrilled to bits with the end  result and will happily recommend anyone who has any dental discomfort or any issues related to their smile. Go to them for their honesty, their transparency, their warmth and their ability to execute what they plan for you to perfection. God Bless you guys!",

She is also very genuine and only suggests what is absolutely necessary without overhyping things. Nothing fancy..just the tender love and care kids need from their doctor.",

Through your kind and generous help, I now have very less pain and in comfort zone.\n\nI am someone who is extremely nervous when it comes to dentists, but the level of care and comfort provided by you in your clinic was an unexpected surprise. \nThe procedure of your appointment at your office was very impressive and allowed me to come in for an emergency extraction of my wisdom teeth and other dental problems, for which I am very grateful. \n\nThank you for your expertise and your kindness. Through your combined effort many people like myself are greatly helped. May God always look down upon you and smile big, too.\nAfter suffering over 8 years, I just want to tell you how grateful I am for what you are doing there. You truly make a difference in lives. I thank you. Be blessed.\nI will certainly be referring any friends or family members of mine who are looking for a new dentist to your office.",

The problem gets more complicated if the child is uncooperative and doctors find doing the treatment difficult. My chiild was such a case and we had been advised by 2 other Pediatric Dentists that we must get the treatment done under GA or sedation and the treatment otherwise wasn't possible. Dr Sony was the third Consultant I visited as I wasn't convinced about the options suggested and didn't want my child to undergo all that. She is the most patient and kind soul I have met. While the first 2 or 3 appts were not very fruitful, but eventually she was able to win over the confidence of my child with her excellent behavior management. The treatment proceeded smoothly thereafter and fillings, pulp therapy treatment and extract ions were done as needed. So happy with her reassuring presence and all treatment outcomes. She is a blessing as a Pediatric Dentist. I have also got other treatment for myself and family done at her clinic thereafter. And my child loves coming back to her.",

I am sure with others procedures as well.\n\nShe has always carefully examined my problem and explained everything about the treatment before proceeding with it, which is quite comforting for me. It gives me more confidence going at the start. The end result has been amazing too and my tooth problem is always solved.\n\nThe clinic is also fantastic and well equipped with all modern equipments needed. My recent experience in getting the Crowning treatment was fantastic as the Clinic is now being run with strict Covid operating procedures. I was given a full body covering suit, foot cover, hand-gloves, head cover and only allowed into the premises after my temperature and oxygen level were measured. Only one patient was treated at a time with strict sanitisation of the procedure room and equipments . \n\nLastly, Dr. Mishra gives a very good experience holistically every-time I go for any kind of dental treatment. I have even travelled to Delhi sometimes to get my treatment (when I wasn't living here ) I highly recommend her for any Dental issues.",

I wasn't happy at all with the way they looked. Had consulted 1 or 2 dentists earlier but somehow wasn't sure of their recommendations and also the charges. Then I saw Dr Sony Mishra. I liked her approach of handling a case like mine and all the suggestions she gave. Ultimately she has done Teeth Whitening and then closed the gaps with Cermaic or Porcelain Veneerw. I am very happy now and extremely thankful to her for everything. Its a great clinic without any unnecessary grandeur and with very reasonable charges.",

She was able to quickly gain the confidence of the children and her treatment planning as well as exceution has also left me super satisfied.

We feel privileged to have made a positive difference to your life. It is also humbling to hear it in as many words from the patient's mouth. We are glad that you were able to identify some of the key elements of our Dental Practice that help us differentiate our clinic and its doctors from so many other options that patients have. We always lay a great emphasis on allowing and helping patients to make their own decisions about their treatment rather than forcing any one thing upon them. Smile Designing or Smile Makeovers is also an art and science that is relatively less explored in Dentistry. We are happy that following our training and so many years of experience handling many different clinical scenarios and varying patient expectations, we are now in a position to deliver them results that keep them happy and satisfied. We wish you well with your career and hope to see you achieving success in all that you do.",

However, the sheer extent of positive impact that Dr. Sony's dental treatment has had on both my personal and professional life, I just could not resist myself from acknowledging her and thanking her for the same. I was quite unhappy with the way my teeth and smile looked and I did not want to go for braces to correct them, as that would have meant sitting without work for at least a year or so. after extensive online research and having been to 4 other clinics in Delhi and 1 in Mumbai, I landed up at Dr. Sony and Dr. Ruchir's clinic. Though their set-up is small (I had the chance to visit their NFC set-up too, which by the way is much more posh and very prettily done up), but their ability to diagnose a problem and then be able to offer multiple solutions for the same is simply amazing. What I really liked is the way they patiently explain the pros and cons of all treatment options, and then help you make the right decision for yourself without any bias or without forcing anything down your throat. *** ****** ******** ****** *** ****** *********** *** *** *** *** ****** ** ********** I underwent Teeth Whitening followed by a combination of Ceramic Veneers and Crowns to correct my smile. I must say I am thrilled to bits with the end  result and will happily recommend anyone who has any dental discomfort or any issues related to their smile. Go to them for their honesty, their transparency, their warmth and their ability to execute what they plan for you to perfection. God Bless you guys!",

We had been to 2 other Child Specialist Dentists earlier, but the treatment could not be done. The patience which Dr. Sony showed in putting our concerns at ease as well as handling all the fillings, fluoride application and root canal or pulp therapy that my child needed is very commendable. She is also very genuine and only suggests what is absolutely necessary without overhyping things. Nothing fancy..just the tender love and care kids need from their doctor.",

Through your combined effort many people like myself are greatly helped. May God always look down upon you and smile big, too.\nAfter suffering over 8 years, I just want to tell you how grateful I am for what you are doing there. You truly make a difference in lives. I thank you. Be blessed.\nI will certainly be referring any friends or family members of mine who are looking for a new dentist to your office.",

The problem gets more complicated if the child is uncooperative and doctors find doing the treatment difficult. My chiild was such a case and we had been advised by 2 other Pediatric Dentists that we must get the treatment done under GA or sedation and the treatment otherwise wasn't possible. Dr Sony was the third Consultant I visited as I wasn't convinced about the options suggested and didn't want my child to undergo all that. She is the most patient and kind soul I have met. While the first 2 or 3 appts were not very fruitful, but eventually she was able to win over the confidence of my child with her excellent behavior management. The treatment proceeded smoothly thereafter and fillings, pulp therapy treatment and extract ions were done as needed. So happy with her reassuring presence and all treatment outcomes. She is a blessing as a Pediatric Dentist. I have also got other treatment for myself and family done at her clinic thereafter. And my child loves coming back to her.",

I am sure with others procedures as well.\n\nShe has always carefully examined my problem and explained everything about the treatment before proceeding with it, which is quite comforting for me. It gives me more confidence going at the start. The end result has been amazing too and my tooth problem is always solved.\n\nThe clinic is also fantastic and well equipped with all modern equipments needed. My recent experience in getting the Crowning treatment was fantastic as the Clinic is now being run with strict Covid operating procedures. I was given a full body covering suit, foot cover, hand-gloves, head cover and only allowed into the premises after my temperature and oxygen level were measured. Only one patient was treated at a time with strict sanitisation of the procedure room and equipments . \n\nLastly, Dr. Mishra gives a very good experience holistically every-time I go for any kind of dental treatment. I have even travelled to Delhi sometimes to get my treatment (when I wasn't living here ) I highly recommend her for any Dental issues.",

I liked her approach of handling a case like mine and all the suggestions she gave. Ultimately she has done Teeth Whitening and then closed the gaps with Cermaic or Porcelain Veneerw. I am very happy now and extremely thankful to her for everything. Its a great clinic without any unnecessary grandeur and with very reasonable charges.",

My daughter loves going back to her and it is so nice to see that compared to earlier when she dreaded a visit to the dentist. Now she looks forward to meeting her Sony Aunty.\nAfter my child's treatment I approached her for my Smile Correction. I had some gaps in my teeth and they were a bit uneven. But in just 3 visits she transformed my smile with a combination of Teeth Whitening, Ceramic Veneers and Bonding. Happy to have found her for our dental treatment needs.",

In a very methodical manner she did the Consultation and explained the workflow. Happy with her explanation, I proceeded for the treatment. She did Teeth Whitening followed by correcting my upper front teeth with a combination of Ceramic Veneers and Composite Bonding. The end results are wow and thanks to her, I have received compliments for the same from friends and family. She is a great Doctor and a gem of a person.",

She has improved my smile so nicely with ceramic veneers and bonding treatment. I am so happy with the smile now and I can't thank her enough.

Thereafter me and my wife have taken treatment here for multiple dental issues. I got treatment for my tooth sensitivity and many fillings done here. RCT was also done for me in single sitting and my wife needed 2 sittings. I also got Ceramic Crowns fixed for my teeth and my wife got a bridge of 4 caps. All the treatment went really fine and we are thoroughly satisfied and happy with their treatment as well as their very caring and helpful nature. God Bless Dr. Sony and Dr. Ruchir.",

I had multiple issues with my teeth and just did not like the way I smiled. I was contemplating treatment for a long while and after a lot of research, zeroed in on 3 dentists. After visiting each of them and discussing the plan and my options with them, I found Dr. Sony and Dr. Ruchir's approach most convincing and well-structured. They gave me multiple options and discussed all the nuances in great detail. Having satisfied myself, I went ahead with my smile makeover. They did a session of Teeth Whitening and followed that up with ceramic Veneers for my teeth. My smile has turned from something I always hid to something I love to flaunt. I must make a special mention of their attitude and the way they reach out to you to allay your fears and make you feel completely at ease. Thank you so much Dr. Sony..you will forever be my favorite dentist.",

They immediately gave us an appointment since it was an emergency and the initial problem was very well taken care of. Thereafter, Dr. Sony took care of all the remaining treatment in multiple visits and all the issues have now been successfully resolved thanks to her expert care and guidance. She has done RCT and fillings and guided us regarding preventing further issues. I wish her and their Smilekraft clinic well and happily recommend them.",

Then I thought of coming back here and seeing Dr. Sony..she has been able to take care of all my problems very nicely. The RCT was done and crowns placed..now zip am very happy and comfortable.

I got one metal free Zirconia cap done for a tooth and 3 Veneers placed. I also got Teeth Whitening done. All the processes went without any hiccoughs and the end result was great and just as promised by Dr. Sony. I appreciate her overall treatment vision and the finesse of her work.

After visiting all 3 and getting Consultations done, I got the greatest confidence with Dr. Sony's approach and plan. After having made this decision, we started the treatment. First cleaning and whitening was done. It was followed by Porcelain laminates for my front teeth and I am most happy with the treatment results. I can now smile confidently and have also received compliments for the same.",

But I have never ever been as satisfied as this time with the overall treatment experience. Dr. Sony and Dr. Ruchir are the most caring and humble doctors I have met. They give you so much time and try their best to explain everything before, during and after the procedure. I finally found the confidence with them to get my smile corrected and what a supremely satisfying job they have done. I am super happy showing off my new smile now. I will visit them again whenever I need any dental treatment and can be in India. I also recommend them to all family and friends and anyone else looking for a super-efficient and yet down to earth team of dentist for their dental treatment needs.",

I arrived at Dr. Sony's clinic after doing a lot of online research. I did visit a couple of other docs before I visited here and after 2 consultations was completely satisfied and confident of going ahead with the treatment.  After Dr. Sony and Dr. Ruchir discussed all the options with me, we decided to go for ceramic veneers with Emax and 1 all-ceramic Procera crown. But, before staring these, she did whitening for my teeth. The session lasted about 90 mins and was entirely comfortable. about 2-3 days later we started the other work and completed everything over the next week and a half. The results have been better than I expected and I am thrilled with the smile I now have. Thanks to all of you at Smilekraft and especially to Dr. Sony.",

As I was moving abroad on a work-related project, I did not find time for the replacement and it led to my current predicament. Being averse to the idea of wearing braces, I was looking for a quick but lasting solution. An exhaustive online search and scrutiny of reviews from fellow patients on places like Google and Practo eventually led me to Smilekraft and to Dr. Sony and Dr. Ruchir. I must thank the way the online review ecosystem has evolved in terms of being able to help people make the right choice and Practo especially needs to be applauded for taking the lead role. I have now got a complete Smile Makeover done with a combination of all-ceramic Emax veneers and direct veneers with Composite bonding. I also got a couple of cosmetic fillings done for 2 of my back teeth. Very happy with all aspects of the treatment and the attitude and commitment of the doctors. End result is superb. I highly recommend Dr. Sony and her team.",

Once he agreed with the idea, we set out to look for a good guy to goto for the job. Internet search and then luckily a word doc mouth recommendation led us to Dr. Sony and Smilekraft. After elaborate discussions about all possible options, we decided to opt for a short treatment with aligners to bring the teeth into a good position and follow that up with porcelain laminates for 4 of my upper front teeth to correct their small size and unesthetic shape. Finally, we rounded off our treatment with a session of Power whitening. Every aspect of my treatment was meticulously planned and beautifully executed. Dr. Sony and Dr. Ruchir are excellent doctors to go to and what is most likeable about them in the genuineness of their advice and their great subject knowledge and skills. There are also very polite and courteous to their patients. Thank you Smilekraft.",

While my child needed treatment for badly decayed milk teeth some of which needed pulp therapy while 2 others needed extraction. I never knew my child would be so cooperative. She has very good hands and skills as well great child management techniques. She also did some cosmetic work for my wife who had some chipped tooth in the front with gaps in between. Both me and my wife are both very happy with the new look she has with 4 ceramic veneers and bonding in 2 teeth. Excellent skills, great understanding of the work and very good end results. I will keep coming back to them for all of mine and my family's dental work as far as possible. 3 cheers to her and the team.",

Dr. Ruchir took care to allay all my fears and help me make the right choice from among the possible options. Thereafter, Dr. Sony performed the procedure taking great care of my comfort and I must say the end result was brilliant. She also diagnosed a cavity in one of my teeth and did the filling also in the same appointment. Even the filling is so beautifully done that one can't even make out that anything at all has even been done. Thanks to the entire team..Dr. Sony and Smilekraft will go a long way.\r\nP.S. I am sending the bride to them tomorrow so that they can turn her smile around to something breathtaking too. :)",

The fact that I never felt rushed into anything, was given ample details on what was being done to my teeth, and all my concerns were addressed made this experience great. I live three hours away and looking at the end results I think it was worth the travel I did to the clinic. Very happy with the treatment (dental bonding). ",

She has such a disarming nature and an assuring presence. She and Dr Ruchir crafted a good treatment plan and discussed all the details with me. Thereafter, we first did Teeth Whitening followed by a combination of Ceramic Veneers for 4 teeth and Composite Bonding for 2 more. The final results were quite in line with ny expectations and I am super thrilled I chose her.",

They are very caring and spend a lot of time in discussing the problems with patients and reassuring them. Dr Sony Mishra has additional specialisation & expertise in dealing with paediatric (Children) patients. I would highly recommend this clinic for whosoever needs dental treatment.  ",

She tried her best during my appointments to make sure my waiting time was minimum. They call and keep us informed beforehand regarding delays etc. They will also ask you repeatedly about the treatment instructions to be followed and the medications we have been asked to take. Such little little things make us as patients feel happy and cared for and almost pampered. You almost feel like you are being treated by your own children and that is a big thing. God Bless her.",

Yet, if you complain of having to wait for your turn, then it is sad. While we try our best to ensure minimal waiting for our patients, in the profession of healthcare it isn't always in the hands of the clinician to ensure they run exactly by the clock. \nRegarding the call you mention, you are fully aware that it was from a patient who had just seen us and left and needed an urgent clarification regarding medications prescribed. While we try our best to not take calls, we think it's unfair to deny our patients the right to talk to us if its really important. Also, each time we have to do something like this, we fully ensure that protocols of sepsis, disinfection and sterilization are not breached in doing so.",

I was in immense pain which suddenly started in my second last tooth and she was immediately able to identify the problem and started my treatment. Dr. Ruchir drained an abscess  and then she continued the remaining treatment. I had to go another 3 appointments to complete the treatment. Everything was quite painless and now I am totally fine. I only wish I had kept coming to her for my regular checkups and this unnecessary problem would never have happened then.

                "reply_text": "Dear Sir..Please note that your observations are completely unfair and not representative of the correct facts. \nFirstly, to the best of our knowledge, we have not suggested any root canal for you. Secondly, and more importantly, we do not give a prescription of medications to each and every patient we see. Prescriptions for medications are only given where we feel they are absolutely required and the medications are unavoidable. India in particular, and the world in general, has been fighting the menace of unnecessary and indiscriminate prescription of medications for a long time now. The side effects of such random medications like pain-killers and/ or antibiotics can create multiple short and long-term issues for patients at large. Hence, it is the moral duty of every ethical clinician to limit the use of medicine prescriptions to only where it is needed. We are proud that we uphold this principle and almost all our patients love us for that. The Consultation Fee (and that fee is clearly displayed on the Practo portal from where you booked your appointment) you pay is for our Consultation and Opinion regarding your problem and its management..no textbook of medicine or dentistry says that you must write medicines for every patient who comes to see you. And just for your information, it is far easier and more time-saving to quickly write a list of medicines and send the patient away, rather than actually explaining the problem to him and telling him why medicines are not needed for the time being and what is the best way to manage the situation.\nThirdly, because of the strict standards of sterilization we maintain and the protocols we rigidly follow, we are often able to limit the use of prescription medications to a large extent which actually works to the patient's advantage both in the short and long-term. So, that again actually increases our workload, but eventually makes us happier and our patients healthier.\nFourthly, your saying that we don't give prescriptions to anyone is again an incorrect generalization. We see a number of patients every day. And we have been doing so for quite a few years now. Do you really think any clinician can actually treat all problems without ever giving prescriptions?..Of course not. So, we do give prescriptions..but only when we feel patients really need it..\nFinally, you say that you took time time to find our clinic. Well, we are sorry but cant really help with that. Maybe you found it difficult because it was your first visit. But, so many of our patients from different parts of Delhi and NCR region, as well as different parts of India and even abroad are able to reach us at our address.\nSir..In today's times it is not easy to stick to ideal principles of practice. We try and make our best efforts to do what is right for our patients without succumbing to short-cuts (like writing needless prescriptions) or worrying about other irrelevant considerations. We regret the fact that you found this approach incorrect. But we would like to reassure you that we have nothing but your best interests in mind. Your heath and well-being, and that of all our patients, is sacred to us. We are here to do a job and we are always hopeful that in doing the job to the best of our abilities, it also makes us popular with our patients (which to a very large extent it does).  But even if doing the right thing brings us some unpopularity, then so be it. We are here to do what is right for you and all our patients, and we shall not give that up for anything (not even our popularity). \nHope you can see things in better light now. Wishing you good luck and good health. God Bless!",

You are also aware of all the details regarding outstanding issues that we shared with you.

You even wanted a precise treatment plan on the phone which we said could only be possible after we examined a few things. You already knew about your Consultation Fees (which is the only payment you ever made to us). If you thought even our Consultation Fees was high, you could have chosen to not visit us. \nAnd the clinic cleanliness bit of course appears like an afterthought. No one in all these years of our practice has ever had anything adverse to say on that account. We only hope you are fair and honest in your assessment. God Bless and Stay Healthy!",
