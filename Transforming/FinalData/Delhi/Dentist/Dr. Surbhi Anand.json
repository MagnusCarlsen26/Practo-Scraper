She does not push her own point-of-view; rather, she allows patients to reach an informed decision.\n\nI was impressed by her clinical ability, and was fully satisfied with the treatment offered.

Generally RCT takes a long time but Dr.Anand understood my situation as I didn't have more than two weeks and accommodated my frequent appointments in her busy schedule..that was very considerate of her..I healed pretty fast only because of Dr.Anand. I also visited Dr.Dhillon at Dental bliss for a gum contouring and it was an equally nice experience.Doctors at Dental Bliss are always on time and most of all they understand  and respect their patients' time. That makes them my dentist for life now \ud83d\ude01",

After visiting many different dentists I can say that Dr. Surbhi and her team are the best i have seen and I will continue to go there and would HIGHLY recommend her to you. \n\nI literally feel part of her family today and not only is the treatment amazing but she will always give you her honest opinion. Most trustworthy doctor I have ever met till now. The service is cost effective and extremely efficient. You will never have any complaints with this doctor. :)",

During covid times, they ensure patients are spaced out,  clinic is constantly sanitized and provide PPE suits for the patients too. \n\nBoth Dr. Aman and Dr. Surbhi are always more than happy to answer all the questions patiently, and explain the procedure. They are also extremely thorough and ensure that there is minimum pain and discomfort. They have also been ever so kind, to follow up and be available for any queries post the treatment. \n\nI would definitely recommend them to every person, and would trust them completely with my dental health.
