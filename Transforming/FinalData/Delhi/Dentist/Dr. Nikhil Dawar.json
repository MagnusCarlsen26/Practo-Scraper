After conducting thorough research on some of the dental clinics in Model Town, I came across Dr. Nikhil's Clinic. He is exceptionally professional and highly skilled in dentistry. Operating a well-equipped clinic with his incredibly efficient dental assistant, he corrected my overbite in the most effective way. I also found Dr. Nikhil  friendly and empathetic, making an effort to build a rapport me me as a patient, taking the time to truly understand my concerns and issues. He has succeeded in offering a  personalized and locally tailored dental solution that perfectly suited my needs.  He took the time to explain each step of the process, ensuring that I felt comfortable and that I received excellent value for my money. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Nikhil to everyone. He truly prioritizes his patients' well-being over financial gains. I am immensely grateful for the wonderful outcome he provided me, and I wish him all the best in his practice.\n",

I'd been dealing  with a bad abscess from botched crowns and was ready to try out anything when some one suggested I see Dr Nikhil  and his team at Model Town Dental. What a turn around that moment was. Not only did they turn it around, they legit understood that I could be scared or nervous and hence created an environment which felt like a safe space. They explained my entire procedure to me throughout the treatment.The root canals were smooth, and they kept checking in until I was comfy. Model Town Dental is THE spot for top-notch tooth help. Massive thanks, guys!",

I'd been dealing  with a bad abscess from botched crowns and was ready to try out anything when some one suggested I see Dr Nikhil  and his team at Model Town Dental. What a turn around that moment was. Not only did they turn it around, they legit understood that I could be scared or nervous and hence created an environment which felt like a safe space. They explained my entire procedure to me throughout the treatment.The root canals were smooth, and they kept checking in until I was comfy. Model Town Dental is THE spot for top-notch tooth help. Massive thanks, guys!",
