Dr. Archana is definitely a great endodontist but she is also a really kind person.

They explained everything in great detail. I've been to many dentists due to the unfortunate dental issues that I face and can vouch easily that most people do not care for giving a long term solution, instead they just want to make a quick buck and get rid of you. But every penny I spent here was worth it. Thanks to both Dr. Archana and Dr. Abhishek!",2021-03-15 18:38:06,False,True,Verified Patient,"Dear Sir,
