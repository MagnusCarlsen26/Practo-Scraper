I searched online & read about Dr Piyush Malik but still looked for recommendations for my friends and neighbours in my Society and everyone recommended me Dentist Dr Piyush Malik. I took appointment and visited the clinic and was warmly greeted by staff at Reception and the clinic was very clean and hygienic. I met Dr Piyush Malik during consultation and he listened to all my problems very calmly and patiently and did a through check up and explained me in detail about the various treatments required in a very simple language using various educative teeth models , charts and videos and answered all my questions and doubts in a very easy to understand language. After consultation I can say with guarantee that he is the most friendly Doctor I ever consulted in my life and I decided to get my advised Root Canal Treatment with Tooth Crown , Teeth Fillings , Scaling and Polishing, Dental Implant , Dental Bridge treatments, Teeth Bleaching, Teeth Veneering , Wisdom Tooth Extraction , Teeth Whitening started in a planned manner. My teeth pain vanished only after first sitting of my RCT treatment and I was completely relaxed during the treatment which was painless and all my fears went away in first sitting of my treatment itself. The instruments , machines and materials used on me were latest and world's best and I could see proper care had been taken to sterilize the instruments and machines so that no infection is spread from one patient to another. All my treatments were painless and the treatment charges were also very affordable. After my treatment was over my parents also got Root Canal Treatment and Dentures made from Dr Piyush Malik and my brother also got Dental Aligners Treatment for his misaligned teeths and my sister got Dental Braces treatment done from Dr Piyush. All my family members are happy and satisfied with his Dental treatment and we have recommended lots of family and friends to his Dental Clinic in Dwarka and they all have been very happy and satisfied with the affordable painless quality Dental Treatment they received from highly experienced Dr Piyush Malik.

I had Teeth Cleaning / Scaling , Teeth Whitening / Bleaching , Root Canal Treatment RCT , Zirconia Crowns / Caps , Implants, Tooth Extraction , Dental Cavity Fillings , Bridge , Wisdom Tooth Extraction done by Dr Piyush Malik at his Dental Clinic in Dwarka and I am amazed by the results. I love my pearly whites after the treatment and getting used to all the compliments after the treatment. Dr Piyush is really Competent * ************* * Friendly and efficient . I highly recommend him to all those who have Dental Phobias he made me overcome mine very patiently. He makes sure to explain everything with ease and is aware of latest and new technology and works for giving you the best possible painless treatment at reasonable cost. He has successfully done those Dental treatments like Implants , RCT and saved teeth in my relatives cases which were refused by many Dentist and that too without pain and at reasonable cost. My whole family , neighbours and Relatives visit his Dental Clinic for all there Dental problems and all of them are happy and satisfied with his treatments. Dental Clinic is very clean , hygenic with proper sterilization of machines and instruments and is well equipped with latest technology to ensure one gets best treatment . My children got Braces and Aligners treatment from Dr Piyush Malik and now there teeth are in perfect shape *** **** **** *** *** **** ******* ** ****** *** ***** ** ********** * *** *** *** *** **** ****** ****** ** ****** as three generation of our family have been visiting Dr Piyush Malik for all the Dental Treatments with full faith and satisfaction and most importantly we appreciate Dr Piyush honesty and transparency as two teeth of my father had cavities for which he was told Root Canal Treatment and Crowns by a Dentist but Dr Piyush fixed them conservatively with fillings and we really like his post treatment care . My Mother Dentures were made by him and now she can eat & smile comfortably from the Dentures without any discomfort and they look so natural that no one is able to tell that she is having artificial teeth. The best thing about Dr Piyush is his proactiveness , be it anytime I pinged / called him , he was always there to help me out with my queries and we always feel that we are in safest hands upon getting our Dental treatment done from him. My whole family including relatives and neighbours would highly recommend Dr Piyush Malik blindly for any Dental Treatment as now he is a family Dentist for all of us since more than 15 years now",

Dr Piyush Malik gave honest advice that there is no need to change the cap as same cap can be fixed again and he took X-ray of other tooth and advised that there is no need to get the tooth removed and he can save the tooth by Root Canal Treatment.\n       Dr Piyush explained every procedure in detail in a very polite and friendly manner. All the treatments were painless and Dr Piyush was very patient and he kept asking me if I was okay or I need a break during Treatment. Dr Piyush Malik made the procedures very comfortable, painless and he did not rush at all. Clinic is also very clean and Hygienic.\n      All the Treatment cost are very reasonable as compared to other Dental Clinics that I and my relatives have been to. It's definitely the best experience I have had with a Dentist and would recommend Dr Piyush Malik and his clinic Dental Med City to everyone. * **** ** ***** **** ** ****** ***** ** **** ******* ** ******* I am completely satisfied and happy with my treatment and I am able to eat food from my Root Canal Treated and capped Tooth. ****** *** **** ** **** ****** ****** ** ****** *\n     ",

I searched online & read about Dr Piyush Malik but still looked for recommendations for my friends and neighbours in my Society and everyone recommended me Dentist Dr Piyush Malik. I took appointment and visited the clinic and was warmly greeted by staff at Reception and the clinic was very clean and hygienic. I met Dr Piyush Malik during consultation and he listened to all my problems very calmly and patiently and did a through check up and explained me in detail about the various treatments required in a very simple language using various educative teeth models , charts and videos and answered all my questions and doubts in a very easy to understand language. After consultation I can say with guarantee that he is the most friendly Doctor I ever consulted in my life and I decided to get my advised Root Canal Treatment with Tooth Crown , Teeth Fillings , Scaling and Polishing, Dental Implant , Dental Bridge treatments, Teeth Bleaching, Teeth Veneering , Wisdom Tooth Extraction , Teeth Whitening started in a planned manner. My teeth pain vanished only after first sitting of my RCT treatment and I was completely relaxed during the treatment which was painless and all my fears went away in first sitting of my treatment itself. The instruments , machines and materials used on me were latest and world's best and I could see proper care had been taken to sterilize the instruments and machines so that no infection is spread from one patient to another. All my treatments were painless and the treatment charges were also very affordable. After my treatment was over my parents also got Root Canal Treatment and Dentures made from Dr Piyush Malik and my brother also got Dental Aligners Treatment for his misaligned teeths and my sister got Dental Braces treatment done from Dr Piyush. All my family members are happy and satisfied with his Dental treatment and we have recommended lots of family and friends to his Dental Clinic in Dwarka and they all have been very happy and satisfied with the affordable painless quality Dental Treatment they received from highly experienced Dr Piyush Malik.

I had Teeth Cleaning / Scaling , Teeth Whitening / Bleaching , Root Canal Treatment RCT , Zirconia Crowns / Caps , Implants, Tooth Extraction , Dental Cavity Fillings , Bridge , Wisdom Tooth Extraction done by Dr Piyush Malik at his Dental Clinic in Dwarka and I am amazed by the results. I love my pearly whites after the treatment and getting used to all the compliments after the treatment. Dr Piyush is really Competent * ************* * Friendly and efficient . I highly recommend him to all those who have Dental Phobias he made me overcome mine very patiently. He makes sure to explain everything with ease and is aware of latest and new technology and works for giving you the best possible painless treatment at reasonable cost. He has successfully done those Dental treatments like Implants , RCT and saved teeth in my relatives cases which were refused by many Dentist and that too without pain and at reasonable cost. My whole family , neighbours and Relatives visit his Dental Clinic for all there Dental problems and all of them are happy and satisfied with his treatments. Dental Clinic is very clean , hygenic with proper sterilization of machines and instruments and is well equipped with latest technology to ensure one gets best treatment . My children got Braces and Aligners treatment from Dr Piyush Malik and now there teeth are in perfect shape *** **** **** *** *** **** ******* ** ****** *** ***** ** ********** * *** *** *** *** **** ****** ****** ** ****** as three generation of our family have been visiting Dr Piyush Malik for all the Dental Treatments with full faith and satisfaction and most importantly we appreciate Dr Piyush honesty and transparency as two teeth of my father had cavities for which he was told Root Canal Treatment and Crowns by a Dentist but Dr Piyush fixed them conservatively with fillings and we really like his post treatment care . My Mother Dentures were made by him and now she can eat & smile comfortably from the Dentures without any discomfort and they look so natural that no one is able to tell that she is having artificial teeth. The best thing about Dr Piyush is his proactiveness , be it anytime I pinged / called him , he was always there to help me out with my queries and we always feel that we are in safest hands upon getting our Dental treatment done from him. My whole family including relatives and neighbours would highly recommend Dr Piyush Malik blindly for any Dental Treatment as now he is a family Dentist for all of us since more than 15 years now",

Dr Piyush Malik gave honest advice that there is no need to change the cap as same cap can be fixed again and he took X-ray of other tooth and advised that there is no need to get the tooth removed and he can save the tooth by Root Canal Treatment.\n       Dr Piyush explained every procedure in detail in a very polite and friendly manner. All the treatments were painless and Dr Piyush was very patient and he kept asking me if I was okay or I need a break during Treatment. Dr Piyush Malik made the procedures very comfortable, painless and he did not rush at all. Clinic is also very clean and Hygienic.\n      All the Treatment cost are very reasonable as compared to other Dental Clinics that I and my relatives have been to. It's definitely the best experience I have had with a Dentist and would recommend Dr Piyush Malik and his clinic Dental Med City to everyone. * **** ** ***** **** ** ****** ***** ** **** ******* ** ******* I am completely satisfied and happy with my treatment and I am able to eat food from my Root Canal Treated and capped Tooth. ****** *** **** ** **** ****** ****** ** ****** *\n     ",

Therefore he ensured that the patient is totally aware of what they are suffering from and what they are getting into. Even during the procedures, he was vigilant, swift, skilled and showed sensitivity to my needs and comfort. I am happy with the experience - would definitely recommend. Prices might feel slightly on the higher side to some, but the treatment and experience is for sure worth it. :)",
