But when pain has become unbearable, we have started video consultation with Dr. Rudra and visited his clinic. With preliminary examination, RCT was suggested by him. The best part I have experience there is having team of expert consultants. Dr. Aditi was taking care of RCT for my mother, with rich experience and ease, she has done the entire process smoothly. Few things I would like call out about:\n - Dr Rudra and team treats and takes care of you like a family\n - Always reachable, rather himself follows up post treatment as well\n - Very transparent with cost of treatment, no hidden charges. In fact, I found the treatment very cost effective.\n - takes cares of Covid safety norms, clean and sanitised place.\n\nI\u2019m really thankful to Dr Rudra and Dr Aditi for such a wonderful experience during my mother\u2019s RCT. Thanks!  ",

At first he ignored it and took some pain killer s himself but after some time when they stopped working and conditions became worse he could not eat anything and then ask to go to hospital which we were trying to avoid.\nI then jus called DR Rudra for advice and he over the call only listened everything very patiently and prescribed few medicines after checking the pics sent which helped my father in law very much and he was able to eat anything and felt better...\nThanks a lot....",

But when pain has become unbearable, we have started video consultation with Dr. Rudra and visited his clinic. With preliminary examination, RCT was suggested by him. The best part I have experience there is having team of expert consultants. Dr. Aditi was taking care of RCT for my mother, with rich experience and ease, she has done the entire process smoothly. Few things I would like call out about:\n - Dr Rudra and team treats and takes care of you like a family\n - Always reachable, rather himself follows up post treatment as well\n - Very transparent with cost of treatment, no hidden charges. In fact, I found the treatment very cost effective.\n - takes cares of Covid safety norms, clean and sanitised place.\n\nI\u2019m really thankful to Dr Rudra and Dr Aditi for such a wonderful experience during my mother\u2019s RCT. Thanks!  ",
