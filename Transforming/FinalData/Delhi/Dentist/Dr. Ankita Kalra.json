The Doctor is a pleasing personality who greets her patient with smile and give confidence in u to do whatever it takes to bring back the smile on ur face. I went for extraction of my wisdom tooth and few fillings. She explained to me the problems i had  with amicable solutions. Got my appointments as per my convenient time. The clinic is clean, hygenic and is well sanitized.\nAfter complete fillings, cleaning and extraction i would say 5 stars are too less to rate. Thank you Dr. Ankita for everything.",
