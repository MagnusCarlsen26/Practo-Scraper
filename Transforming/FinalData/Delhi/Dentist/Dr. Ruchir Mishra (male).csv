"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,Implants(Fixed Teeth),Dental Implant Fixing,",0,0,YES,"A great overall experience. Had first visited Dr. Ruchir for an issue related to my wisdom tooth which had been troubling me. He first did a gum treatment there which kept things fine for more than a year. But when the problem recurred, he removed it for me very painlessly and I felt comfortable during the procedure as well as after it. Thereafter I also got a missing molar replaced by him with a dental implant and a cap. Everything has gone very well for me and I am very satisfied with both his approach to his patients as well as his treatment planning and performance of the procedures. Would happily recommend him and his team including Dr. Sony and others.",2021-05-01 10:34:27,False,True,Abhishek,,,
