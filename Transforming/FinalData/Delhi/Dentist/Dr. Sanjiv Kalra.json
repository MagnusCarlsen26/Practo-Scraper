As someone who has had multiple root canals before, I can confidently say that Dr. Kalra is an expert in his field\n\nFrom the moment I walked into his office, I was impressed with the professional and welcoming environment. Dr. Kalra explained the procedure and answered all of my questions with patience and clarity. He made sure that I was comfortable throughout the entire process, which was greatly appreciated.\n\nDuring the procedure itself, I was amazed at how smoothly everything went. There was literally \u201cno pain\u201d, which was surprising and a welcome relief compared to my previous experiences. His staff was professional and responsive, which made me feel even more at ease.\n\nIf you're in need of any dental work, especially a root canal, I highly recommend Dr. Kalra. You won't be disappointed!",

Dr. Kalra explained the procedure and answered all of my questions with patience and clarity. He made sure that I was comfortable throughout the entire process, which was greatly appreciated.\n\nDuring the procedure itself, I was amazed at how smoothly everything went. There was literally \u201cno pain\u201d, which was surprising and a welcome relief compared to my previous experiences. His staff was professional and responsive, which made me feel even more at ease.\n\nIf you're in need of any dental work, especially a root canal, I highly recommend Dr. Kalra. You won't be disappointed!",
