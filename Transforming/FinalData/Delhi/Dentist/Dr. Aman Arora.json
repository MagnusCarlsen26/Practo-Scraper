He had an immediate extraction plan. Took an x-ray, showed it to me and asked what I wanted to do. He inquired if I'd like to save it while just filling the cavity or get it removed. I chose the later. So, we started and in about an hour I left with a smile.\n\nThe best bits were:\n\u2022Minimal pain (I thanked him for it)\n\u2022He asked me, during the procedure, if I knew that he had removed the tooth (which I didn't), so I smiled back. \n\u2022I called him at 11:30 p.m. the same day about a concern and he very calmly explained to me what I needed to know.\n\u2022No waiting (First visit to him ever; called first).\n\n\nIn a week now, I'm stitches free and pain free.\nThe only thing you need to worry about is the cost, which depends on the procedure. Since I went under a surgical removal, it cost a bit but looking at the experience I had, it was worth every penny.\n\nI even asked the doc if I could have a copy of my x-ray and he mailed it to me, and even called to confirm if I had received it!\n\nOverall, a brilliant experience of an apparently painful wisdom tooth extraction (which it wasn't; discomfort, sure).\n\nBoy, the doctor has to be good to make you write such a long review!",

But it was Dr Dimple and Dr Aman who were so commendable  in detecting the root issue and I am glad that I followed their advice and got my self braces even at the age of 30; I was hesitant  for a while in deciding though, but I am glad I did. It not only had an aesthetic but also cured all my sensitivity  and headache problem and can't appreciate much for their thorough professional work with a very friendly and assuring touch of theirs. Honestly speaking they are actually and only the one dentist specialist on whom I can blindly trust on. I really do not know that whether it is actually correct to say that or not actually but where all the other dentists just keep their original focus not on treatment, there they and their humbleness in treating me actually like their own little daughter is really commendable. A large thank you to themThey have solved all my teeth problems so seamlessly so now it is that I feel that people do not keep praising them just like that.An ideal dentist for me for the method with which they actually cured my tooth issues so early as well as so perfectly, without a single root canal, I feel others may not be able to do the same.Thankfulness is all I want to express to you my dentist.\u00a0Regards Laxmi",

He had an immediate extraction plan. Took an x-ray, showed it to me and asked what I wanted to do. He inquired if I'd like to save it while just filling the cavity or get it removed. I chose the later. So, we started and in about an hour I left with a smile.\n\nThe best bits were:\n\u2022Minimal pain (I thanked him for it)\n\u2022He asked me, during the procedure, if I knew that he had removed the tooth (which I didn't), so I smiled back. \n\u2022I called him at 11:30 p.m. the same day about a concern and he very calmly explained to me what I needed to know.\n\u2022No waiting (First visit to him ever; called first).\n\n\nIn a week now, I'm stitches free and pain free.\nThe only thing you need to worry about is the cost, which depends on the procedure. Since I went under a surgical removal, it cost a bit but looking at the experience I had, it was worth every penny.\n\nI even asked the doc if I could have a copy of my x-ray and he mailed it to me, and even called to confirm if I had received it!\n\nOverall, a brilliant experience of an apparently painful wisdom tooth extraction (which it wasn't; discomfort, sure).\n\nBoy, the doctor has to be good to make you write such a long review!",

But it was Dr Dimple and Dr Aman who were so commendable  in detecting the root issue and I am glad that I followed their advice and got my self braces even at the age of 30; I was hesitant  for a while in deciding though, but I am glad I did. It not only had an aesthetic but also cured all my sensitivity  and headache problem and can't appreciate much for their thorough professional work with a very friendly and assuring touch of theirs. Honestly speaking they are actually and only the one dentist specialist on whom I can blindly trust on. I really do not know that whether it is actually correct to say that or not actually but where all the other dentists just keep their original focus not on treatment, there they and their humbleness in treating me actually like their own little daughter is really commendable. A large thank you to themThey have solved all my teeth problems so seamlessly so now it is that I feel that people do not keep praising them just like that.An ideal dentist for me for the method with which they actually cured my tooth issues so early as well as so perfectly, without a single root canal, I feel others may not be able to do the same.Thankfulness is all I want to express to you my dentist.\u00a0Regards Laxmi",

After my first sitting only, I was so much relieved and was feeling so glad that I made the right decision to go to Dr. Arora. I have had root canal treatments in the past as well but they were quite painful but the way Dr. Arora treated me was really a painless procedure. I would highly recommend Dr. Arora if you are looking for any kind of dental procedure.",
