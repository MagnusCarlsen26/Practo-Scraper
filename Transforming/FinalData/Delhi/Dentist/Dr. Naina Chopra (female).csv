"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Zirconia Crowns,Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"Introduction:
Over the course of 30 days, I had the privilege of undergoing 7 sittings at this remarkable dental clinic. The procedures included the meticulous crafting of a dental bridge, precise cavity fillings, and a comprehensive general dental hygiene checkup.

Here‚Äôs my detailed review structured around the various parameters:

1) Technical Prowess:
I stand in awe of the Dr. Naina Chopra‚Äôs unparalleled technical prowess. The dental bridge, an intricate work of art, seamlessly blends with my smile, a result of their attention to detail. The cavity fillings, expertly performed, are virtually imperceptible. Their proficiency is a testament to their commitment to perfection.

2) Domain Knowledge:
In my experiences with various dental professionals, none have matched the depth of knowledge exhibited by Dr. Naina Chopra. Beyond detailing procedures, they unraveled the origins of my concerns and equipped me with effective oral health strategies. Their dedication to patient education shines brightly.

3) Support Staff (Manisha and Rakhi):
The clinic's warm and supportive team played an integral role in my experience. The receptionists extended a genuine welcome, and the dental assistants, with their patience and reassurance, transformed the visits into comforting journeys. Their camaraderie turned appointments into pleasant conversations.

4) On Time Appointments and Scheduling Structure:
Punctuality is a cornerstone here. The 7 appointments started and concluded precisely, reflecting their commitment to efficient scheduling. This seamless organization radiates respect for patients' time and exemplifies their professionalism.

5) Compassion and empathy:
Amidst their technical finesse, what truly touched me was their boundless compassion. They approached each sitting with empathy, customizing treatments to address my unique concerns. The dentist's attentive listening elevated my comfort, transcending the usual patient-practitioner dynamic.

In culmination, my 30-day journey with this dental practice was transformative. Seven sittings, each an opportunity for excellence, bore witness to their unmatched dedication. From the intricate dental bridge to the artful cavity fillings and the educational checkup, their commitment to holistic dental care is evident. I wholeheartedly recommend this practice‚Äîa sanctuary where skill and compassion converge‚Äîto all seeking extraordinary dental experiences.",2023-08-15 08:08:15,False,True,Lalit,,,
