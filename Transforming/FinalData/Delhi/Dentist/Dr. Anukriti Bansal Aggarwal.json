I felt a difference( in a good way) consulting her, I hope you should too.\n",

She listened to our problems patiently and checked all reports and suggested that my mom is allergic to all metallic items in mouth. My mom had a bridge in mouth of 6 teeth and 1 cap of metal which was causing pain and allergy.No other doctor could catch this but it is the expereince and intelligence of Dr Anukriti which found the issue. My mom is having no allergy in mouth as all bridge and caps are replaced to non metallic material which gave total relief to my mom.Without doing any unnecessary test Dr diagnosed and treated issue.We are glad that we visited Dr Anukriti at right time . She did all procedures painless. Her behaviour and concern for patient was outstanding. No doctor treats with such care.We would recommend Dr anukriti to everybody as she is the best.Thank u Doctor for treating my mom so nicely. Our family was in great tension due to mom's illness but sorted all.Thanks for being in our life!!! God bless u !!! ",

I felt a difference( in a good way) consulting her, I hope you should too.\n",

She listened to our problems patiently and checked all reports and suggested that my mom is allergic to all metallic items in mouth. My mom had a bridge in mouth of 6 teeth and 1 cap of metal which was causing pain and allergy.No other doctor could catch this but it is the expereince and intelligence of Dr Anukriti which found the issue. My mom is having no allergy in mouth as all bridge and caps are replaced to non metallic material which gave total relief to my mom.Without doing any unnecessary test Dr diagnosed and treated issue.We are glad that we visited Dr Anukriti at right time . She did all procedures painless. Her behaviour and concern for patient was outstanding. No doctor treats with such care.We would recommend Dr anukriti to everybody as she is the best.Thank u Doctor for treating my mom so nicely. Our family was in great tension due to mom's illness but sorted all.Thanks for being in our life!!! God bless u !!! ",

All the doctors that I had consulted everyone had the same opinion that I should get my tooth removed/extracted but I didn't want that. So I came to Dr. Anukriti for second opinion , she explained me everything and told me that it can be saved as I am too young to loose an important tooth but we will have to treat it with utmost care and this procedure will take time. \nAfter 6 month of treatment , my tooth is in very good condition now and whole experience was very smooth and pain free. So I will recommend Dr. Anukriti 10/10.",
