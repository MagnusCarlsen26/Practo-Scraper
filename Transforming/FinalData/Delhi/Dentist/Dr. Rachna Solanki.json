The clinic follows very strict sterlization protocol. Dr. Rachna is very good in dealing with patients. She explains the problem and its solution very patiently. I got the scaling of my teeth done from her and she did it very professionally. The fear of visiting a dentist also reduces if you have her as your doctor. After being convinced of the treatment, my family members also chose to change their old dentist and visited Dr. Rachna. She not only recommends treatment but also explains the cause of it and how we can take care of our teeth at home using homely methods like rinsing mouth, gum massaging etc. Her aim is to treat the patient and not to increase the expenditure of the patient. It is rare to find good ethical dentists like her these days.",
