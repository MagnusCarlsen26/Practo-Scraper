My tooth has become quite sensitive  to  hot & cold temp so, I consulted  him.\nFirstly, I have to wait for almost an hour though my online appointment was confirmed. He was quite friendly. When I told him about my issue, he told me that one of my tooth is having faulty crown  because of which my nerves are exposed and have become sensitive. He suggested me to remove that crown and get a new crown for my tooth.He shared price list of different kinds of crown. Since, my crown was under warranty for 10yrs so I checked with my Dentist in Bangalore  who has done RCT for that  tooth. He told me to share x-ray of my tooth for crown replacement. I contacted city dental center to share xray of my tooth but they didn't  responded. Since I was going out of town ,so I didn't  want to remove my crown and postponed it till I come back. \nToday, I consulted another dentist  as my previous experience was not good *** ** ** ***** ******** ** **** ** **** *** ***** ** **********  **** *** ***** ** ** **** ** ****** *** **** ** ****** ******* ** **** **** ********** ******  ** *** ***** **** **** ** ****** *** ** *** ***** ********** ",

Finally a stage came when I had to get them removed & then I noticed that I am unable to eat because all my main molar teeth were lost. I came to Dr.Anurag through a very strong referral, so I was quite confident that time. I was suggested for dental implants treatment.Later the treatment was done & it was absolutely painless and comfortable. Lots and lots of thanks to Dr.Anurag for the wonderful work.",

And as predicted by my sister he did save most of my teeth and gave caps on them. During the treatment he explained the entire procedure in detail and took complete care of my comfort.

But within 2 weeks my implant started moving and I was told that it had failed.  I was irritated and went to Dr Anurag. He removed the implant and cleaned the part because it was infected. He did some procedure to correct the site and placed a fresh implant. I got a tooth fixed on that three months back and just had a check up today. I have no problems and can eat with me that tooth.  This is where the difference lies and when you fall prey to the gimmicks by these so called corporate centres.  I recommend Dr Anurag to everyone. ",

I have to say it's been the best experience till now . \r\n\r\nThe doctor is highly knowledgable, competent and precise. He has a good communication skills and makes patients comfortable. In my experience of dentist visits I have to say the best dentist.The implant feels like a new tooth. Would recommend the doctor to all my friends and family. Thanks",

It was just a painless surgery.\r\n\r\n In a span of year i undergone two surgeries by him and both of them were done by Dr. Anurag Ahuja. He is a very talented surgeon and the most important part is he knows the patient mindset and then he proceed for treatment.He has a very friendly approach with patients, first he and his team tries to relax the patient and then starts his medication. Before this I visited at many places but personally I recommend Dr. Anurag Ahuja .",

I then got thick zirconia crowns made by a good company and original warranty cards from Dr anurag. I have waited for 6 months to write this feedback to see what would the result be. I am delighted to report that there has been no problem whatsoever and I have been eating everything to test the crowns. So please visit a **** dentist to put your hard earned money to good use.

Dr promised a painless treatment and fantastic results. There was quite a rush at his clinic so I was even more convinced that he was probably the best choice (it was difficult to get an appointment due to the waiting) . We went ahead with the procedure and put in 6 implants in the lower jaw. We had to wait for 3 months for the implants to heal. Last week the teeth were finally fixed and my dad is eating mutton. I have never seen him eat so well in the past few years. Thanks doc for bringing the joy of being able to eat good food back into my dad's life. I really appreciate it. highly highly recommended.",

I did not face any pain. But, there are certain things which i did not like at all. \n1- Treatments done here will cost you in a higher side. One tooth RCT costed me 10000rs. With capping without warranty. \n2- I am highly highly dissappointed with the wait time. They make you wait for hours and hours. They will give u appointment of 2:30pm and you will have to wait till 4pm to finally meet the dentist. \n3- The staff at reception is highly inefficient in managing clients. They do not give you any sensible reason of the process they follow in managing appointments. \n\nSo if you have a whole day to spend here for getting a dental treatment done..yes go for it. \nFor me, i did not like this unprofessional attitude.\n",

Dr. Anurag has started my treatment. He and his team done a great job. I did not feel any pain during my RCT or even after that. It takes couple of appointments to finish 2 teeth RCT. Moreover I am impressed with his vision. He is creating dental chain and establishing City Dental Centre as a brand so that everyone can think of a treatment satisfaction.\nI recommend everyone to once visit Dr. Anurag for Dental Treatments.",

He took an X-ray and showed me that the damage was not such that couldn\u2019t be fixed. He immediately started the rct and then placed a medicine inside the tooth and gave me painkillers for the night. I was comfortable at night and within the following week he finished the rct with zirconium capping. I recommend dr Anurag because he surely knows how to take care of his patients.",

In the first sitting itself, he showed me pics of my teeth on the screen in front of me (which no dentist had done so far) to explain the issue in detail. Also, 2 dentists before him had strongly advised me to go for braces to cure my sensitivity issue, which Dr. Anurag never felt the need for. He simply advised me to go for gums cleaning since my gums were swollen (which I could see in the pics as well), which would bring down the sensitivity.\n\nHappy with- Patient friendliness, calm & composed nature, sincere approach towards each patient and time given to explain the problem and treatment in detail.\n\n Thank you and Kudos to you for being so hands-on with your work!",

Then finally I visited dr anurag and he said that he could save and rebuild my teeth. There was no need for implants. I was over joyed and started treatment immediately. He did a combination of root canals and bridges and it took 3 weeks but all my teeth are finally healthy again. I recommend dr anurag because where others fail to live up to the patient expectations , dr anurag fulfills them. Thank you doc and I recommend you to everyone.",

Gradually over a period of years the teeth were becoming  black and then all of a sudden after so many years I had severe pain. I showed  it to dr anurag as he was highly recommended by my sister.  He said that because of the fall many years back the roots of the teeth were traumatised and had shrunk. He shows me the xray. The solutions was to remove the teeth and replace them. I googled and did my research and indeed what dr was sugggesting was right. I asked dr anurag to do what he thought was best for me. He extract the two teeth and paced dental implants and give me temporary teeth. Then after 2 months he placed permanent crowns on them . It looks amazing became my natural teeth that had became black were really ugly. ** *** **** **** ********* *** I recommend him completely ",

I was in despair because I am in my 30's and did not want to loose so many teeth and also the replacements like implants would weigh heavily on my pocket. Then someone suggested I visit dr anurag. When he saw my case he said that he would be able to save most of the teeth. Finally a ray of hope.  He did rct's in a couple of teeth and then did some rebuilding of the teeth. Then he placed some crowns. It took about 3 weeks but he saved most of my teeth. I am so grateful to you sir for this and I am going to take some serious good care of my teeth. Guys please visit dr anurag if you want a good doctor who actually cares about the patient and not just money. Recommended.",

Then I showed to Dr Anurag and he checked it and said that it was because the root of the tooth was broken and the tooth was not to be treated by rct and needed extraction. I was already irritable with the pain and told Dr Anurag to do what he felt was required. He removed the tooth and placed an implant in its place. After a week he placed a tooth on top of that. I had no pain and a functional tooth.  People out there reading this post please review a dentist well before visiting. I recommend dr Anurag because he advised me and treated me well. Thanks doc.",

I booked an appointment with Dr Anurag and asked him to give me a painkiller. When he checked it he showed me that there was put oozing out of the gums. I was shocked because I had no idea it was in such a bad condition. He convinced me to get the tooth extracted.  I agreed because I really had no choice.  Dr Anurag did the extraction and I didn't even get to know because I had no pain and the tooth was out in a jiffy.  I don't know why I put off the process for so long.  Dr Anurag is simply marvelous.

On one cleaning appointment dr anurag convinced me to trust him with the braces treatment he would supervise. After a million questions I decided to do it. He placed transparent ceramic or invisible braces. You could hardly tell that I had braces. It took a year and recently I got them removed. My teeth are now perfectly aligned. I have to wear a retainer for 6 months to prevent relapse but that is okay. Good advice. Recommended ",

Then i got them done again by Dr anurag.  Its been a few months and I have had no problem with them. Also the warranty card he gave me can be checked for authenticity online.  Please go to a good dentist like dr anurag to prevent being taken for a ride . Thanks doc. Recommended. ",

He said that we could save the teeth by doing rct and rebuilding the teeth. That was all I wanted to hear. I went ahead with the treatment. Except for one tooth the doctor was able to save all my teeth. So thankful for such talented doctors. Recommend to everyone ",

He took an X-ray and sure enough there was a lot of pus that had caused the swelling. He did an rct and drained the pus. It took about 2 days for the swelling to subside. Then the rct  was completed and a crown was placed.  I am happy with the treatment and doctor. Recommend to all. ",

Then I came across dr Anurag on practo and read a feedback about someone who has been treated in a similar case. So I booked an appointment with him. Dr Anurag and dr rasleen together treated my dad. They made a silicone feeding plate that also filled the hole caused by surgery. I was in tears after I saw my dad eat on his own orally without the tube. God bless you guys.

He handled a very critical & complicated part of my Mothers Caps and root canal issues without even a bit of pain and supported and comforted my mother from time to time in my absence during the entire time to sort out the complicated part. Almost all the teeth capping were in a very crucial and complex stage so much so that any dentist would think twice prior taking the job into his hands. Dr.Anurag & his staff had been kind enough to handle this serious issue and sort it out bringing back the confidence in my mother once again. I sincerely thank Dr.Anurag and his staff million times for bringing back the smile not only to my mother but also to us as a family. Last but not the least, I found Dr.Anurag most genuine a thorough Gentleman and value add without even reminding us about payments till the entire treatment was completed.",

He diagnosed the problem and recommended a repeat root canal as the canals were not cleaned till the root which is why the pain still existed. I had pain in my upper tooth which my previous dentist diagnosed as \"sensitivity\". When Dr. Anurag checked it he mentioned that it was referred pain caused by my wisdom tooth. My root canal was done by doctor and it was completely painless.My advice to everyone is to not choose a dentist only because they charge you less. I went through a 2 month horrendous experience.While my problem was solved by Dr.Anurag in just 4 visits. I would recommend him for all your dental promblems",

I was in Noida on a work trip and suffered a terrible wisdom toothache, thus landed up at his clinic early in the morning. Though they were scheduled to open an hour later they were so kind that opened the clinic to hear me out. \n\nVery warm, gently explained everything that needed to be done, temporarily relieved me of the pain and I got a tooth extraction scheduled in a couple of hours.\n\nBased upon my experience I would highly recommend Dr.Anurag and City Dental Centre.",

Flawless work with great hands.\nI got 4 root canals, 2 bridges for both molars and a single crown. This entire process consist of multiple worthy sittings.\n\nSince a good amount of cost was involved so prior visiting city dental I have gone through multiple dental center in Noida but was convoluted, when I came across Dr. Anurag was convinced enough to start my treatment at that very moment. Was satisfied under the below impression:-\n\n#Explained things beautifully\n#Co-ordial behavior\n#Cost was reasonable\n#Location specific for me since I am too residing in sector 61\n#He is very regular at his profession\n\nSo I am concluding as a satisfactory patient :-) ,hope this review will help you all.\n\nTHANK YOU....\n\nAnurag Sir and his team...Keep up the good work!!!\n\n\n\n",

He is himself an amazing dentist but he also has a team of hand-picked professionals who assist him and together they are a very competent lot. The clinic is really well done, neat and hygienic and the staff courteous. The treatment was painless as they gave numbing injection and I did not feel a thing. Also the root canal were done in a single sitting. Overall they really take good care of the patient's . Recommend to all.",

He diagnosed that because of a previous filling i had gotten done somewhere else had disturbed my bite. He then grinded my teeth and reset the bite. He also gave me a night guard to relieve the pain in the joint. Then pain in my joint is now getting better day by day. A big thank you to dr Anurag. God bless ",

Only I know how much tooth pain I was suffering from. My friend referred me to Dr. Ahuja. Although this clinic is not near to my house but seeing my friend's confidence I visited there. His reference was absolutely right. Dr. Ahuja treated me so well as a Dentist Doctor. He first spent 15 to 20 minutes only in making me comfortable with him. He was very professional and amicably treated my tooth without any pain. And thanks to sir for giving me those breaks in treatment to be relaxed by throat. Thanks for being a heroic dentist sir. I would also like to appreciate the whole dental team there. They are focussed on patient care and record keeping.",

I went for a root canal treatment, and I was shown the exact decay of my tooth. They use advanced tools and techniques and try to explain to us the entire procedure which is quite helpful. I am very happy and satisfied with my treatment and would definitely recommend the city dental centre to everyone.",
