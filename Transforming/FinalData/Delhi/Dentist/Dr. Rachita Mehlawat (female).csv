"Wait time,","Toothache,Broken Teeth,",0,0,NO,Doctor behaviour is very bad.

And when the problem increased, you suddenly showed up with recommendation from some other doctor and wanted us to treat your child as per the other doctor and that too in cheaper ""pre-decided"" charges. 
When we informed you that we can not do treatment as per you and your other family doctor's treatment plan and charges, the child's mother started yelling at the doctor itself !!! We request you to at least first learn how to behave in a clinic and how to talk to a doctor. 
This was the second time when you came for your child's treatment after his successful  treatment of the other tooth around 3 months back. If our behaviour  and work ethics were so bad, you shouldn't have visited us second time. 
We always give the correct opinion to our patients and carry out treatment as per our diagnosis and expertise. We always believe in ethical practice. 
Yelling at the doctor is not acceptable in any circumstances and we strongly discourage this type of behaviour.  And that's why the treatment was denied.
