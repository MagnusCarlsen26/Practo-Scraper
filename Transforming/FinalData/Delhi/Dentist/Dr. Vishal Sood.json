We visited him for a wisdom tooth pain and extraction was advised. He explained to us the latest techniques and after our concurrence advised the following:\na) Use of piezosurgery which is a novel technique that utilizes piezoelectric vibrations in the application of cutting bone tissue from the tooth using ultrasonic frequency. This makes the extraction easier, painless to a point and less blood flow.\nb) Use of  Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy, where platelets derived from the patient's blood through centrifugal process is inserted in the tooth socket for early rebuilding of the damaged part.\nBoth the above applications were used by Dr Sood in our case. Result was safe and quick extraction (less than 7 minutes), no pain as area was numb with anasthesia, and subsequent filing of the socket with PRP and two small sutures. The cut healed much faster and sutures were removed after one week, the cut was almost healed. Recovery has been great and we are extremely happy with the innovative approach and procedure.\nIf tooth extraction scares you, Dr Sood is your answer. God bless him!",

We visited him for a wisdom tooth pain and extraction was advised. He explained to us the latest techniques and after our concurrence advised the following:\na) Use of piezosurgery which is a novel technique that utilizes piezoelectric vibrations in the application of cutting bone tissue from the tooth using ultrasonic frequency. This makes the extraction easier, painless to a point and less blood flow.\nb) Use of  Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy, where platelets derived from the patient's blood through centrifugal process is inserted in the tooth socket for early rebuilding of the damaged part.\nBoth the above applications were used by Dr Sood in our case. Result was safe and quick extraction (less than 7 minutes), no pain as area was numb with anasthesia, and subsequent filing of the socket with PRP and two small sutures. The cut healed much faster and sutures were removed after one week, the cut was almost healed. Recovery has been great and we are extremely happy with the innovative approach and procedure.\nIf tooth extraction scares you, Dr Sood is your answer. God bless him!",

After diagnosis it was found that there was an urgent need for tooth extraction since my teeth were severely damaged.  The way doctor explained the entire case patiently and answered all my queries several times I was certain that I am at the right place. I have had very unpleasant experiences in the past but I am glad I found Dr Vishal Sood. I later also got tooth implant done, it was a long protocol, but the doctor patiently attended me several times even after the procedure was completed. I am really happy with the service. Also, adviced my son to get his wisdom tooth extraction. He is also extremely satisfied. Would definitely recommend Dr. Sood. ",
