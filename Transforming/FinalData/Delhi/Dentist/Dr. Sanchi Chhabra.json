She makes you very comfortable throughout the treatment and has a very genuine concern for her patient's dental health.\n\nShe is a very pleasant doctor and describes the entire procedure in depth with patience and is very accommodative with the appointments and scheduling. The best treatment for the patient is actually practiced in the clinic very ethically at the most reasonable cost feasible. Her clinic in Defence Colony has a very fine ambience and cleanliness.\u00a0\n\nI must say that being a retired Army Colonel I am entitled to free Dental treatment at Army Dental clinics/ECHS empaneled clinics but still I prefer to undertake Dental treatment from Dr Sanchi because of her professionalism and dedication towards her patients.\u00a0\n\nI strongly recommend her to anyone looking for good dental care in New Delhi/ NCR. She has excellent staff, like Ms. Kajal at the Reception and good clinical assistant too. Thank you Dr Sanchi Chabbra.\u00a0",

She took the time to do a proper examination and explained fully the treatment I needed. She talked me through every step of the treatment and on a number of occasions during the treatment asked if I was alright. After being scared to go to the dentist for so long, I couldn't have had a better experience. I was put at ease from the moment I walked through the door till the moment I walked out. I can honestly say that I don't feel as worried about going to the dentist again. I couldn't recommend Dr. Sanchi Chhabra highly enough.",

She fixed it in 15 mins with a filing (almost painless) and I was good to go! She also explained how to care for it going forward. Would highly recommend to everyone!",

She fixed it in 15 mins with a filing (almost painless) and I was good to go! She also explained how to care for it going forward. Would highly recommend to everyone!",
