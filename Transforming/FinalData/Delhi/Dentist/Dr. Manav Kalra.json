I've had a phobia of dental work since childhood, but he made the entire process comfortable and pleasant.\nDr. Kalra\u2019s friendly demeanor and professionalism put my nerves to rest. He explained everything clearly, ensuring I was comfortable every step of the way. The outcome has been a significant confidence booster for me. I used to avoid smiling in photos because I disliked my teeth, but now I can\u2019t stop smiling and loving the way my teeth look! Would 100% recommend Dr Kalra. ",

A comment I didn\u2019t think I would have thought to give before my treatment with him: he is also not quick to give extensive treatments, and recommended to me a simpler treatment than I thought I would have needed, or other doctors would have gladly given for financial gain. I strongly recommend him as a cosmetic dentist because he is not only professional and scientific in measurements etc, but also has style \ud83d\udc4c\n\nNow for those who would like details: \n\nI came to Dr Kalra thinking that I needed braces. As an actress, I was looking to align my teeth for cosmetic reasons, and friends had recommended Invisalign. Upon my request Dr Kalra explained to me in detail how the process works and knowing of my limited time in Delhi, he was able to schedule a consultation at my convenience.\n\nTo my surprise and initial dismay, after looking at my teeth he did not recommend that I get braces. He suggested that a simpler alternative of aligning my two front teeth by shortening one of them slightly (and safely!), as well as a mild teeth whitening program would be sufficient in my case, and urged me to try it out before going into a longer, more troublesome, financially more demanding process of getting Invisalign for probably minimally different results. I was so set on getting braces for \u201cperfect\u201d teeth that I was not convinced, so, reasonably, he suggested I also get second opinions before deciding, but I was grateful that he put my individual need as a patient over his personal gain (getting braces would have definitely made his clinic more money). I decided to go with Dr Kalra\u2019s suggestion, as he explained that i could still go for braces if I was not happy with these initial results. It made sense to me so I went for it. \n\nHe was meticulous in shortening ans shaping one of my front teeth, and allowed time for me to get used to a certain length and if not satisfied, to come back and get more trimmed, which I ended up doing. Because this is such a permanent procedure, I was quite nervous, but Dr Kalra gave me all the necessary details so I could make informed decisions for myself, and he gave guidance and space as needed, so I felt very comfortable throughout. He also went through the trouble to take a (very professional) picture of my teeth to satisfy my mother\u2019s dispute of what she saw my teeth length to be, and assured her with more scientific measurements than us subjectively looking at it.\n\nLastly, when I got the whitening trays, he taught me how to take them off and do everything I was supposed to do at home myself, \u201cteaching me how to fish, rather than just giving me fish\u201d. I don\u2019t know how the saying goes exactly. ** *** ***** ** ** ** ********* ******* the clinic is clean and tastefully designed, and you will enjoy (imagine enjoying a dentist experience!) your visit, while getting professional health care.",

He's the nicest dentist I've met who cares and makes a sincere effort for his patient. He has a good and hygienic clinic with proper equipment. \nPreviously I couldn't write a review so I'm mentioning my experience collectively here today as I happened to visit him more than once and let me tell you every single I've been to him, he's interacted with me so very nicely, addressed all the issues, very nicely and sincerely answered all my questions and addressed my worries, not for once did he try to avoid or ignore any question or issue, not for once did he let me feel uncomfortable, as if queries increase there is general tendency of other people to avoid or not care to go beyond a point but he is there to help and guide you right. \nHe did the procedures properly and with such a ease using proper equipment that I despite being of a sensitive nature felt easy to go through it, which might have been tricky or tough for him at times as he has to maintain precision and do it properly but he managed it well. He has all the required equipment with him. \nRecently there was a tough situation where I don't think other Doctors would have managed to provide a solution to the problem I faced where I needed timely help for a Dental problem but surprisingly Dr Manav still managed to provide a solution which was very unexpected and it helped me which shows what a true Doctor he is. He's the person with solution, if you've got a problem just talk to him, one he will talk very nicely & humbly and he will give you a solution. One he will resolve your dental problems and rest after talking to him you'll feel relieved and good. \nHe's of such a good nature that whenever I talk to him I feel I'm talking to my Elder Brother. Always smiling and with a positive vibe he helps you a lot more! Well this is the kind of Doctors we need and are best who care enough. He steps up to help you, you just visit him and you'll see it yourself and you'd want to go meet him again! ",

However, we acknowledge a lapse in communication leading to misunderstandings.\n\nWe would like to share some additional thoughts on your treatment. \n.\n1.\tYou came to us with severely damaged, discolored teeth due to earlier dental treatment, you were at the risk of losing your front two teeth. One of the MAIN treatment goals was to SAVE what was left and provide many years of service. It is always much more complex to work on unhealthy, broken teeth which have been worked on previously. We believe you will continue to get the most out of those two front teeth because of our efforts. \n.\n2.\tDuring the Crown & veneer delivery appointment it is our strict protocol to get proper consent from our patients before final bonding. In the rare event, that something does not feel right, we do not hesitate to send the work back to the lab for the necessary improvements. This is a failsafe protocol that we employed in your case. \n.\n3.\tWe specialize in cosmetic dentistry; this means we take dozens of high-definition photos for communication with the lab and to make sure your expectations are matched. These photos were constantly shared with you and your mother.\n.\n4.\tDuring the trial appointment you and your mother both were happy with the way it turned out and both gave unambiguous consent to finalize the work. We took multiple photos of the trial stage and discussed it with you on a 60-inch screen to see all the exact details.\n .\n5.\tAt your most recent visit, you came with your mother to evaluate some discoloration of one of the teeth. We discussed it again in detail. We were not able to notice any such discoloration, your mother also agreed with our evaluation.\n .\n6.\tRemoval of a bonded veneer is often an invasive procedure. It is our opinion that it is not in your best interest to damage the tooth further by seeking retreatment.\n .\n7.\tWe also encourage you to seek out a second opinion, we will help you with that in whatever way necessary. As mentioned to you in person, we are happy to share all your documentation including detailed photographs of the entire procedure from day one. \n.\nWe are always available to you & your family. \nYou know how to reach us",

In such a distressing time, Dr Sanjeev Kalra has been a god sent for me! \n\nHis guidance and umpteen patience on healing this left lower premolar tooth of mine has been commendable. Since I have been neglecting this troublesome tooth for quite some time and with the declaration of lockdown, my pain became unbearable. There was a point when I begged Dr Sanjeev to take out my tooth. Again his calm and composed demeanour got the better of me. He made me understand the science and reason behind not taking out the tooth. I still remember what he said \u2018Taking out a tooth means killing a life\u2019 - kind of stayed with me only because of the his sheer dedication and commitment towards making me understand things and giving the right treatment. I recovered, gaining some knowledge of root canal and filling.\n\nThen came Mr. Manav Kalra. I visited him to get a cap on the affected tooth. He took measurement and explained me the kinds of cap available. What is incredible about him is all these technical dental issues was explained by him in a very lucid manner. Not just this he very kindly discussed some other red flags that might cause concern in the coming times, suggesting ways to combat them with timely and correct treatment. Also, he managed to motivate me to take care of my tooth more proactively. \n\nTo summarise my experience, my visit to Kalra Dental clinic taught me to include dental hygiene as part of my lifestyle. Thank you so much doctors for all your efforts :)",

Due to my poor dental health (primarily genetic reasons) I had  reached a hopeless situation with no functional teeth left in my lower jaw and just a marginally better situation in the upper. They both assured me that all was not lost, and it was still not too late. So the very first step I had to take was simply to believe this, and commit to a restoration plan which could take a year to complete, but with significant improvements and benefits being delivered regularly during this time. It took me about 2 months to take this decision, just because I had no self-confidence to go through with it. I am now half way through (6 months) of my rehabilitation plan, and it has been an amazing journey so far. All the steps have been planned meticulously by Dr Sanjiv and Dr Manav, keeping in mind factors like my severe gagging reflex and other dental phobias. They patiently explained each step, answered all my silly questions, and always worked according to my preferred schedule. Latest technology was used in materials and surgical methods. Consequently, I have been able to  get full mouth implants placed in my lower jaw, and will soon have a full set of solid functional and aesthetically pleasing teeth. The upper jaw has also been improved far beyond my expectations, with some teeth strengthened, and a custom designed partial clasp denture placed to give me a fully-functional upper mouth. I can safely say that anyone in my situation should take hope, and simply place themselves in the capable hands of Dr Sanjiv and Dr Manav. I will be happy to share my experiences in more detail, if anyone wishes to do that. I will post an update next month, perhaps with a video and photos.",

We must rely on pain or any other symptom for us to investigate further. This is exactly what we did and we treated the tooth successfully. You have a fully functioning tooth in your mouth due to that procedure.\n \nWhile you were in Delhi, during your routine check-ups and cleaning appointments, there was no reason to suspect anything wrong with any of your other teeth. You developed symptoms in a fresh untreated tooth many months after our last appointment, while you were in a different city. The dentist there diagnosed you after you complained of pain in a seeming healthy tooth.  On X-rays, it was clear you had an abscess, which needed to be treated.  \nWhile this is unfortunate, I must give some attention to your hyperbolic comments about it affecting your eye, etc. It simply would not have, the treatment involves routine dental work, I believe you have recovered well from it. \n\nOur policy (for good reason) is that we do not subject our patients to harmful x-ray radiations on healthy teeth if there are no signs/symptoms of any disease. \n\nI have taken the effort to have two long detailed conversations with the new dentist, to my understanding he is in complete agreement with everything mentioned above and that he has explained all of this to you. \n\nFurther: I currently enjoy the confidence of your entire family including your father, mother, sister, and two young nieces, all of whom are my patients, and have very positive reviews about their multiple experiences at the clinic over the years. \n\nAs always you know where to reach me. I\u2019m happy to connect. \n\nWarm Regards\n\n",

Excluding the one visit to Sanjiv (senior doctor at the clinic) for a root canal treatment, I am, or at least was up until 9 months ago, a patient of Dr. Manav Kalra.\n\nIt genuinely pains me to leave a scathing review for a medical professional, and to leave a honest and negative review for a Dentist who is a neighbor and my former student (health and fitness) ** *** ******* ** ***** ********** *** ********** ************ ***** ** **** ******\nLong story short, turns out, I had carried an abscess the size of a Green Pea atop my right canine for longer than 8 months.  This abscess was discovered by my new dentist in the South of India, *** *** ******* **** ** ******* *** ****** ** **** ******** *** ******* *** ***** **** ****** *** ***  He was alarmed that my immunity had fought against this abscess for as long as it had, and that I risked letting the infection spread to the rest of my face, even affecting the sight in my right eye (worst-case scenario when un-checked).\n\nI had met with Manav two times over the course of six months, where, he very \"diligently\" cleaned my teeth, and helped me arrive at a place where I would feel good about the \"quality of my smile\".  I remember so well, that he even prodded at the abscess, only to ask me what that might be?! What else might a medical professional of ten plus years of experience do other than ask the patient about the development in his mouth, right?!!!!  Because us patients, we know best don't we?!!!\n\nNow I ask you, the general community out there, that how is it that with BINOCULARS pointed directly into my mouth, *** * ********* ***** ** *** ********* **** ** * ********* ***** ****** **********\n** *** **** ***** * *** **** ***** *** *********** *** **** ***** ** *** ***** *** ******** ** ***** *********** *********** *** **** ***** * ***** ** ******* ** ** ***** *** ** ***** ** *** *** *** ********* ******* ** *** ******\n\nTwo visits for dental cleaning, and not once was I alerted or let alone made to sit for a few extra minutes for any examination of the gum area.  \n\n* *** ****** *** *** ****** **** ** ***** *** ********** ******** ** *** ********* ****** **** **** ****** *** ******* ********  \n\nSo, my request to future patients who might consider paying Manav a visit for any cosmetic treatment ****** **** ** ****** *** ********* *** *** ****** *********** is that you do your due diligence, and refrain from getting swayed by the fancy clinic in the fancier residential area code.",

With great apprehension, I booked an appointment with Dr Kalra at his clinic. I had an infected wisdom tooth that was incredibly painful.  All I wanted was for the pain to go away. When I heard that the tooth would have to be extracted, I started panicking.  But, to his credit, Dr Kalra calmed me down and talked me through the entire procedure. And even though I was nervous I knew that the procedure had to be done so I bit the bullet and readied myself for a painful extraction. But, that did not happen. All I felt was the pinprick of the syringe and within ten minutes, my tooth was out. All through the process, I was guided by Dr Kalra and his excellent team. I am writing this review after a week and a half of the extraction and I cannot state how happy and relieved I am to have found Dr Kalra.  If you've ever had a traumatic experience at the dentist and are reluctant to get your teeth checked, I would tell you to go to Dr Kalra. You will not regret it. ",

                "review_text": "The short version for those who prefer it:\n\nDr Manav Kalra is personable, truly has the patient\u2019s best interest in mind, and is extremely meticulous and careful in his work. A comment I didn\u2019t think I would have thought to give before my treatment with him: he is also not quick to give extensive treatments, and recommended to me a simpler treatment than I thought I would have needed, or other doctors would have gladly given for financial gain. I strongly recommend him as a cosmetic dentist because he is not only professional and scientific in measurements etc, but also has style \ud83d\udc4c\n\nNow for those who would like details: \n\nI came to Dr Kalra thinking that I needed braces. As an actress, I was looking to align my teeth for cosmetic reasons, and friends had recommended Invisalign. Upon my request Dr Kalra explained to me in detail how the process works and knowing of my limited time in Delhi, he was able to schedule a consultation at my convenience.\n\nTo my surprise and initial dismay, after looking at my teeth he did not recommend that I get braces. He suggested that a simpler alternative of aligning my two front teeth by shortening one of them slightly (and safely!), as well as a mild teeth whitening program would be sufficient in my case, and urged me to try it out before going into a longer, more troublesome, financially more demanding process of getting Invisalign for probably minimally different results. I was so set on getting braces for \u201cperfect\u201d teeth that I was not convinced, so, reasonably, he suggested I also get second opinions before deciding, but I was grateful that he put my individual need as a patient over his personal gain (getting braces would have definitely made his clinic more money). I decided to go with Dr Kalra\u2019s suggestion, as he explained that i could still go for braces if I was not happy with these initial results. It made sense to me so I went for it. \n\nHe was meticulous in shortening ans shaping one of my front teeth, and allowed time for me to get used to a certain length and if not satisfied, to come back and get more trimmed, which I ended up doing. Because this is such a permanent procedure, I was quite nervous, but Dr Kalra gave me all the necessary details so I could make informed decisions for myself, and he gave guidance and space as needed, so I felt very comfortable throughout. He also went through the trouble to take a (very professional) picture of my teeth to satisfy my mother\u2019s dispute of what she saw my teeth length to be, and assured her with more scientific measurements than us subjectively looking at it.\n\nLastly, when I got the whitening trays, he taught me how to take them off and do everything I was supposed to do at home myself, \u201cteaching me how to fish, rather than just giving me fish\u201d. I don\u2019t know how the saying goes exactly. ** *** ***** ** ** ** ********* ******* the clinic is clean and tastefully designed, and you will enjoy (imagine enjoying a dentist experience!) your visit, while getting professional health care.",

He's the nicest dentist I've met who cares and makes a sincere effort for his patient. He has a good and hygienic clinic with proper equipment. \nPreviously I couldn't write a review so I'm mentioning my experience collectively here today as I happened to visit him more than once and let me tell you every single I've been to him, he's interacted with me so very nicely, addressed all the issues, very nicely and sincerely answered all my questions and addressed my worries, not for once did he try to avoid or ignore any question or issue, not for once did he let me feel uncomfortable, as if queries increase there is general tendency of other people to avoid or not care to go beyond a point but he is there to help and guide you right. \nHe did the procedures properly and with such a ease using proper equipment that I despite being of a sensitive nature felt easy to go through it, which might have been tricky or tough for him at times as he has to maintain precision and do it properly but he managed it well. He has all the required equipment with him. \nRecently there was a tough situation where I don't think other Doctors would have managed to provide a solution to the problem I faced where I needed timely help for a Dental problem but surprisingly Dr Manav still managed to provide a solution which was very unexpected and it helped me which shows what a true Doctor he is. He's the person with solution, if you've got a problem just talk to him, one he will talk very nicely & humbly and he will give you a solution. One he will resolve your dental problems and rest after talking to him you'll feel relieved and good. \nHe's of such a good nature that whenever I talk to him I feel I'm talking to my Elder Brother. Always smiling and with a positive vibe he helps you a lot more! Well this is the kind of Doctors we need and are best who care enough. He steps up to help you, you just visit him and you'll see it yourself and you'd want to go meet him again! ",

We take all feedback seriously, especially critical ones. \nAt the outset, we would like to mention, that the treatment provided to you has been of the highest quality and we would not change anything on the treatment plan or execution if we had to do it all over again. However, we acknowledge a lapse in communication leading to misunderstandings.\n\nWe would like to share some additional thoughts on your treatment. \n.\n1.\tYou came to us with severely damaged, discolored teeth due to earlier dental treatment, you were at the risk of losing your front two teeth. One of the MAIN treatment goals was to SAVE what was left and provide many years of service. It is always much more complex to work on unhealthy, broken teeth which have been worked on previously. We believe you will continue to get the most out of those two front teeth because of our efforts. \n.\n2.\tDuring the Crown & veneer delivery appointment it is our strict protocol to get proper consent from our patients before final bonding. In the rare event, that something does not feel right, we do not hesitate to send the work back to the lab for the necessary improvements. This is a failsafe protocol that we employed in your case. \n.\n3.\tWe specialize in cosmetic dentistry; this means we take dozens of high-definition photos for communication with the lab and to make sure your expectations are matched. These photos were constantly shared with you and your mother.\n.\n4.\tDuring the trial appointment you and your mother both were happy with the way it turned out and both gave unambiguous consent to finalize the work. We took multiple photos of the trial stage and discussed it with you on a 60-inch screen to see all the exact details.\n .\n5.\tAt your most recent visit, you came with your mother to evaluate some discoloration of one of the teeth. We discussed it again in detail. We were not able to notice any such discoloration, your mother also agreed with our evaluation.\n .\n6.\tRemoval of a bonded veneer is often an invasive procedure. It is our opinion that it is not in your best interest to damage the tooth further by seeking retreatment.\n .\n7.\tWe also encourage you to seek out a second opinion, we will help you with that in whatever way necessary. As mentioned to you in person, we are happy to share all your documentation including detailed photographs of the entire procedure from day one. \n.\nWe are always available to you & your family. \nYou know how to reach us",

In such a distressing time, Dr Sanjeev Kalra has been a god sent for me! \n\nHis guidance and umpteen patience on healing this left lower premolar tooth of mine has been commendable. Since I have been neglecting this troublesome tooth for quite some time and with the declaration of lockdown, my pain became unbearable. There was a point when I begged Dr Sanjeev to take out my tooth. Again his calm and composed demeanour got the better of me. He made me understand the science and reason behind not taking out the tooth. I still remember what he said \u2018Taking out a tooth means killing a life\u2019 - kind of stayed with me only because of the his sheer dedication and commitment towards making me understand things and giving the right treatment. I recovered, gaining some knowledge of root canal and filling.\n\nThen came Mr. Manav Kalra. I visited him to get a cap on the affected tooth. He took measurement and explained me the kinds of cap available. What is incredible about him is all these technical dental issues was explained by him in a very lucid manner. Not just this he very kindly discussed some other red flags that might cause concern in the coming times, suggesting ways to combat them with timely and correct treatment. Also, he managed to motivate me to take care of my tooth more proactively. \n\nTo summarise my experience, my visit to Kalra Dental clinic taught me to include dental hygiene as part of my lifestyle. Thank you so much doctors for all your efforts :)",

Due to my poor dental health (primarily genetic reasons) I had  reached a hopeless situation with no functional teeth left in my lower jaw and just a marginally better situation in the upper. They both assured me that all was not lost, and it was still not too late. So the very first step I had to take was simply to believe this, and commit to a restoration plan which could take a year to complete, but with significant improvements and benefits being delivered regularly during this time. It took me about 2 months to take this decision, just because I had no self-confidence to go through with it. I am now half way through (6 months) of my rehabilitation plan, and it has been an amazing journey so far. All the steps have been planned meticulously by Dr Sanjiv and Dr Manav, keeping in mind factors like my severe gagging reflex and other dental phobias. They patiently explained each step, answered all my silly questions, and always worked according to my preferred schedule. Latest technology was used in materials and surgical methods. Consequently, I have been able to  get full mouth implants placed in my lower jaw, and will soon have a full set of solid functional and aesthetically pleasing teeth. The upper jaw has also been improved far beyond my expectations, with some teeth strengthened, and a custom designed partial clasp denture placed to give me a fully-functional upper mouth. I can safely say that anyone in my situation should take hope, and simply place themselves in the capable hands of Dr Sanjiv and Dr Manav. I will be happy to share my experiences in more detail, if anyone wishes to do that. I will post an update next month, perhaps with a video and photos.",

It allows us to grow and serve the public even better. \n\nLet\u2019s go over some details, it will hopefully provide some context. \n\n3 years ago, we diagnosed you with \"crack tooth syndrome\": this is a condition that most often has no clinical signs and there is no visual way for us to detect it. We must rely on pain or any other symptom for us to investigate further. This is exactly what we did and we treated the tooth successfully. You have a fully functioning tooth in your mouth due to that procedure.\n \nWhile you were in Delhi, during your routine check-ups and cleaning appointments, there was no reason to suspect anything wrong with any of your other teeth. You developed symptoms in a fresh untreated tooth many months after our last appointment, while you were in a different city. The dentist there diagnosed you after you complained of pain in a seeming healthy tooth.  On X-rays, it was clear you had an abscess, which needed to be treated.  \nWhile this is unfortunate, I must give some attention to your hyperbolic comments about it affecting your eye, etc. It simply would not have, the treatment involves routine dental work, I believe you have recovered well from it. \n\nOur policy (for good reason) is that we do not subject our patients to harmful x-ray radiations on healthy teeth if there are no signs/symptoms of any disease. \n\nI have taken the effort to have two long detailed conversations with the new dentist, to my understanding he is in complete agreement with everything mentioned above and that he has explained all of this to you. \n\nFurther: I currently enjoy the confidence of your entire family including your father, mother, sister, and two young nieces, all of whom are my patients, and have very positive reviews about their multiple experiences at the clinic over the years. \n\nAs always you know where to reach me. I\u2019m happy to connect. \n\nWarm Regards\n\n",

With great apprehension, I booked an appointment with Dr Kalra at his clinic. I had an infected wisdom tooth that was incredibly painful.  All I wanted was for the pain to go away. When I heard that the tooth would have to be extracted, I started panicking.  But, to his credit, Dr Kalra calmed me down and talked me through the entire procedure. And even though I was nervous I knew that the procedure had to be done so I bit the bullet and readied myself for a painful extraction. But, that did not happen. All I felt was the pinprick of the syringe and within ten minutes, my tooth was out. All through the process, I was guided by Dr Kalra and his excellent team. I am writing this review after a week and a half of the extraction and I cannot state how happy and relieved I am to have found Dr Kalra.  If you've ever had a traumatic experience at the dentist and are reluctant to get your teeth checked, I would tell you to go to Dr Kalra. You will not regret it. ",

As a result, we could plan the course of treatment in a way that made sense aesthetically as well as utilised the body's way of healing itself.\n\nThe staff is super helpful and friendly, and the Kalra Dental Clinic premises are spotlessly clean.

He then advised me to come for the second sitting a week later after allowing my gums to heal. In the second sitting he cleaned the gums very thoroughly and advised me to get my teeth clean every 6 months. He even took time to show me how healed gums should look like and feel like. \n\nThe clinic is super hygienic and Dr. Manav have very gentle hands.

The contour of the teeth was so precise and perfect, I didn't need time to adjust. He did an outstanding job and i couldn't be happier and more comfortable.

There were zero waiting times, in fact we usually started early. In terms of the treatment, all of my issues were resolved, and afterwards also there have been no problems. He uses latest technology that involved 3D scanning of my teeth to model the crowns accordingly, so they fit very well too and the process was much easier on the patient as well. I would highly recommend anyone looking for dental help to consult Dr. Manav Kalra.",

He is capable and approachable, taking the time to clear all doubts before beginning any treatment. Well-versed and evidently passionate about both the art and science of aesthetic dentistry, and up-to-date with the latest advances in the field, you (and your smile) are in good hands with him. I do not feel the need to fly to Mumbai any more - I highly recommend him.",

But he made sure he gave me a make-shift, which I\u2019m pretty confident will last me long enough till my next appointment once the virus is in control. And he was so quick but steady, I got done in 20 minutes, fully satisfied and confident all over again! He\u2019s super friendly and warm!

The ease with which he explains the process and takes you through it is absolutely great. He is extremely meticulous, friendly and has kept things in his clinic that way too - modern chic clinic with a personalised touch.\n\nMy upper lateral incisors were very small as compared to the rest of my teeth set so he put dental veneers without shaving off my natural tooth. No anaesthesia or pain killers were given and only in a couple of sittings, my smile was corrected. \n\nBarring the cosmetics part of it, even otherwise I totally recommend Kalra Dental Clinic because it has a great set of doctors and Dr Manav Kalra to anyone who wants to get their smile corrected or rejig confidence!",

There was no waiting time, and he immediately checked my tooth, took X-ray and found that my last wisdom teeth had a big cavity. He explained clearly using a large screen with the X-ray image, and removed my wisdom teeth within 10 min, without any pain or discomfort. He has given clear instruction for post-extraction and everything was veyr smooth and painless. \n\nBecause of the full satisfaction, I returned to him after 1 week for teeth cleaning and whitening. Again there was no waiting time, and he carried out teeth cleaning smoothly and also introduced me with a home whitening kit, which is less costly for the same effect. I'm now booking for a next consultation for teeth alignment, and also booked an appointment for my daughter's check up and husband's teeth cleaning. He is very friendly and explains the procedure clear.  The procedure has always been very smooth and efficient. I highly recommend Dr Kalra.",

I opted for bioclear composite veeners which are looking extremely natural and beautiful!! All thanks to him for all his patience and good work ! I feel his fees is a little on a higher side I felt but it\u2019s worth the value coz of his patience and honesty he puts in his job.",
