Little one has to go through multiple RCTs and we were in big stress that how can he bear all these in such age. But a big thanks to Dr. Rachita for resolving all our problems in a very easy way.\nDr. Rachita is a very humble person, she described all the procedures with details and surprisingly she was never in a hurry to get the things done against my child's will. She is so loving and friendly to my child.\nThe patience level of Dr. Is unbelievable with the kids, she ensure that the kids be comfortable with all the difficult procedures only then she continue doing it. Several times when my child is in no mood to get the procedures done, Dr. Never forced him to sit and continue, she very humbly let the child go and visit again for the same.\nI recommend each and everyone in my known and as well as to all who are looking for a Dr. For their kids, Dr. Rachita Mehlawat is the name.\nOnce you visit her, you all got to know that it is the place you're looking for.\nThank you Dr. Rachita and Team.",

I would really appreciate for all her efforts she kept doing to engage my child in doing his treatment so gently. I just called her n told my problem that I have visited so many dentists but my child is not allowing anyone to reach his mouth but she was so confident when she told me u just bring him up here rest u leave on me, that I went straight away from Punjabi bagh to Dwarka. I wish her good luck and would recommend every parent who has faced sleepless nights facing their child in pain. ",

Dr. Jitendra extracted my wisdom tooth very easily and Dr. Rachita has done re-rct of my husband's tooth.  Dr. Rachita helped us out of her way giving it a personal touch by asking us about our pain even after the process. This shows the concerns  of a doctor for her patients. The treatment was very comfortable and painless. \n\nThe clinic is well equipped with  latest equipments and hygiene is also top notch. I must say dental craft is the right place for all my dental issues.  ",

Little one has to go through multiple RCTs and we were in big stress that how can he bear all these in such age. But a big thanks to Dr. Rachita for resolving all our problems in a very easy way.\nDr. Rachita is a very humble person, she described all the procedures with details and surprisingly she was never in a hurry to get the things done against my child's will. She is so loving and friendly to my child.\nThe patience level of Dr. Is unbelievable with the kids, she ensure that the kids be comfortable with all the difficult procedures only then she continue doing it. Several times when my child is in no mood to get the procedures done, Dr. Never forced him to sit and continue, she very humbly let the child go and visit again for the same.\nI recommend each and everyone in my known and as well as to all who are looking for a Dr. For their kids, Dr. Rachita Mehlawat is the name.\nOnce you visit her, you all got to know that it is the place you're looking for.\nThank you Dr. Rachita and Team.",

I would really appreciate for all her efforts she kept doing to engage my child in doing his treatment so gently. I just called her n told my problem that I have visited so many dentists but my child is not allowing anyone to reach his mouth but she was so confident when she told me u just bring him up here rest u leave on me, that I went straight away from Punjabi bagh to Dwarka. I wish her good luck and would recommend every parent who has faced sleepless nights facing their child in pain. ",

Dr. Jitendra extracted my wisdom tooth very easily and Dr. Rachita has done re-rct of my husband's tooth.  Dr. Rachita helped us out of her way giving it a personal touch by asking us about our pain even after the process. This shows the concerns  of a doctor for her patients. The treatment was very comfortable and painless. \n\nThe clinic is well equipped with  latest equipments and hygiene is also top notch. I must say dental craft is the right place for all my dental issues.  ",

We request you to at least first learn how to behave in a clinic and how to talk to a doctor. \nThis was the second time when you came for your child's treatment after his successful  treatment of the other tooth around 3 months back. If our behaviour  and work ethics were so bad, you shouldn't have visited us second time. \nWe always give the correct opinion to our patients and carry out treatment as per our diagnosis and expertise. We always believe in ethical practice. \nYelling at the doctor is not acceptable in any circumstances and we strongly discourage this type of behaviour.  And that's why the treatment was denied.  \nThank you",
