He explained the entire procedure very well from total duration of aligners to companies, and from cost to comfort of the aligners from conventional braces. As I used to travel a lot and meet different people, a good smile was all that I needed. Invisalign was the  aligner I selected for me. Thanks to Dr Amit that he showed all the treatment outcome even before I started my treatment. He is very friendly, has a lot of patience, listened to my queries and doubts and suggested the best of the treatment for me. As I am in married \nwith family and kids, this is what I needed so that no body can see my orthodontic treatment through aligners. Thanks to him, will recommend him to my friends and family. ",

I am really happy after he sorted out my major problem of gum bleeding and scaling. With his treatment I now have a shining smile. I am no more embarrassed to talk to others. I would visit him for sure for my other dental issues as well. I would recommend him to everyone who ever is suffering with any sort of dental issue. He is different than many other doctors. I am amazed. Thanks a lot Amit",

He explained the entire procedure very well from total duration of aligners to companies, and from cost to comfort of the aligners from conventional braces. As I used to travel a lot and meet different people, a good smile was all that I needed. Invisalign was the  aligner I selected for me. Thanks to Dr Amit that he showed all the treatment outcome even before I started my treatment. He is very friendly, has a lot of patience, listened to my queries and doubts and suggested the best of the treatment for me. As I am in married \nwith family and kids, this is what I needed so that no body can see my orthodontic treatment through aligners. Thanks to him, will recommend him to my friends and family. ",

He had come to visit me and was suffering from tooth problem from a long time. He recovered himself after he visited Dr. Amit. I am really happy after he sorted out my major problem of gum bleeding and scaling. With his treatment I now have a shining smile. I am no more embarrassed to talk to others. I would visit him for sure for my other dental issues as well. I would recommend him to everyone who ever is suffering with any sort of dental issue. He is different than many other doctors. I am amazed. Thanks a lot Amit",
