I was so pleased with his words and his behavior after that I took my complete treatment there. My treatment is complete today.\nNow my teeth are not the same as before, now my teeth are unrecognizable after orthodontic treatment.I am very satisfied with my treatment.\nDr Pratik Sir taught me so much about Dentistry and In my journey of Braces that I have a lot of information about dentistry now and his staff is very nice and explain very well always organised in aligning my appointment on time because after one year I was coming from my hometown sometime during this journey I was apprehensive and concerned for myself now how this will finish in proposed time but sir was always keen in giving me time and best treatment to me always my treatment actually finished in 2 years approximately\nIam seriously thankful for his positive environment in his clinic the Aura is having good vibes and again Iam thankful to\nDr.Pratik Aggarwal sir and his staff from the bottom of my heart .",

I didn't know if what he said at time was true or not but it gave me enough hope to get braces and now after three years , I can say that it was true because it has been fixed. Sir has always explained to me the process , what they're trying to do, how they're doing it which always gave me a sense of assurance. I'm extremely satisfied with how the treatment turned out and those three years were worth it. I'd highly recommend sir to anyone who's scared of taking the first step towards the betterment of their teeth because sir knows how to push you and how to achieve the goals. ",

I didn't know if what he said at time was true or not but it gave me enough hope to get braces and now after three years , I can say that it was true because it has been fixed. Sir has always explained to me the process , what they're trying to do, how they're doing it which always gave me a sense of assurance. I'm extremely satisfied with how the treatment turned out and those three years were worth it. I'd highly recommend sir to anyone who's scared of taking the first step towards the betterment of their teeth because sir knows how to push you and how to achieve the goals. ",
