I can speak highly enough of his commitment, expertise, and genuine concern for his patients' health. Apart from clinical expertise, his approach to patient care goes beyond the ordinary, amidst an incidence of exemplary diagnoses, cost-cutting, and fast relief. If needed, I can substantiate all these with my experiences. I believe that throughout my interactions with Dr. Dhall, I always felt valued as patients or attendants at his his Suraksha Clinic Rana Pratap Bagh, Max Hospital Pitampura  and later Max Shalimar Bagh..\n\nIn light of my positive experiences, I am disheartened to witness an individual resorting to practo.com to express grievances against healthcare professionals like Dr. Sanjay Dhall. In our opinion, such actions undermine the integrity of the medical profession and fail to acknowledge the tireless dedication that doctors like Dr. Dhall invest in their patients. \n\nAs a satisfied patient or attendant under Dr.Sanjay Dhall\u2019s care for several years, I am compelled to attest to his unwavering commitment, exceptional competence, and genuine dedication to patient well-being.\n",

I requested him to write some blood tests like HBA1C to know the blood glucose levels . He didnt listen to us and just wrote some medicines . * ** *** ********** ** ** *** ** ******* *** ***** ***** ****** *** ***** *** ** **** *** *** ******** ************** * We just came out with the prescription containing diabetes medicines . later on i had to consult another doctor who patiently listened to us and wrote blood investigations for diabetes and kidney . later on we realisedthat kidney function tests for diabetics should be done once every 6 months to one year . Just because this person was  arrogant and not ready to listen , we ended up wasting money and our valuable time . A complete wastage of our time and money ",
