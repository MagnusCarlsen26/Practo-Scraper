In both the situations he stood best than the rest and cured the issue of malaria within 5 days and a year for TB. Compared to reputed all india institute of medical .... doctors who diagnosed my issue as lung cancer and misguided me for almost 6 months due to which it converted into TB, he was right on the spot from the scratch regarding diagnosis and treatment. I also advised my family members and friends for consulting him for various medical issues ranging from severe fevers to chronic fissures all of them resulted in positive treatment.\n\nNotable aspect - If he read your bodily conditions and medical history accurately then you can consult him for almost every issue for which he is capable of treatment.",
