We regret for the inconvenience caused. 

As per clinic records you visited us on 20th February'22.

We don't support such activities like pushing patients to purchase medicine from in house dispensary (as that's third party and opened for emergency purpose only) nor we promote lab or diagnostic centre for tests or investigations.

In case any clinic staff involved in this , kindly put his/her name in written complaint to Director of centre, for proper action against it.

Secondly, the medicine named 'R-forte' contains coenzyme Q10 , methylcobalamin mainly  which is available in many reputed pharmacies in Delhi including in Laxmi Nagar only. Someone gave you wrong information that it's manufacture in laxmi nagar, as no medicine manufactures in laxmi nagar. As no manufacturing plant can't be here.

In case if you find difficulty in buying any prescribed medication or any cost burden, you should contact treating doctor , so that, he can able to advised you the same alternative that suited best for you. 
( Instead of putting blame game on your treating doctor after a month time )

As many pharmacists gives alternative without  having proper information of composition.

Hope you are doing well and look forward to redressal your complaints.
