He brought back my mother from a near-vegetative state to her usual buoyant self. During a span of three years, my 80-year-old mother fractured both sides of her hip; had an infected gallbladder that had to be removed; was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s; suffered from dementia, and silently slid into deep depression. She stopped talking and eating, became immobilized and was unable to control her bodily fluids. Dr. Roy steered back her cognitive skills and with his team rebuilt her broken physical strength. Today she is walking, attending philosophy classes and taking an active interest in life. Dr. Sanchayan Roy returned my mother back to us!\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Roy is an excellent geriatric care doctor who combines short-term health problems with long-term continuum of care. He coordinated my mother\u2019s myriad medications for multiple age-related ailments to create a comprehensive health picture. Based on this he generated a preventive care regime that he enforces by reminding family members to act on it. His continuous care gives us hope that we might be able to mitigate some of my mother\u2019s anticipated health issues by replacing it with a better quality of life. Dr. Roy truly takes his Hippocratic oath seriously (a rare quality these days).\n\nHaving experienced healthcare in many parts of the world, I can say without hesitation that our experience with Dr. Roy ranks among the best, and I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending him to my friends and to their aging parents. I can cite my experience with Dr. Sanchayan Roy and his team of doctor\u2019s as a blessing!",

Many a time I have had to take quick action when she has suddenly collapsed or fallen without warning. My first response is to call Dr. Sanchayan Roy even before informing her family members. He has always picked up the phone and guided me as to what I need to do to stabilize her. He then either sends an ambulance or arrives himself at his earliest convenience, depending on the severity of the situation. He takes full responsibility of the actions needed. Courtesy Dr. Sanchayan Roy\u2019s consistent involvement in the health and wellbeing of my employer I am able to fulfill my duties with care and confidence. I have to admit, without Dr. Roy\u2019s medical support, I might not have accepted this challenging assignment. To me he is the \u201cMiracle Man\u201d! \n",

It is not like 1 tablet per symptom. So counting number of tablets doesn't help if you don't understand why they are being prescribed. So before coming to a social media had you asked relevant questions and doubts about the medication and diagnosis it would have been better. The brands of medicine recommended were generic brands too but there is no compulsion to buy that brand only. You can choose alternative brands. Again you could have asked for alternative brands if required. It would be better in future if you clarify these things with your treating doctor.",

One patient had come to the ICU at that time and I had to rush there. When I spoke to you I told you clearly regarding the emergency and requested you to reschedule it at 5.45 pm. You said yes and I thought it was fine. My assistant had also tried to call you in the afternoon to reschedule the appointment but could not get through to you. I understand the diffulties faced but sometimes I need to prioritise my patients in a given situation. I still regret the inconvenience caused.",

Regarding diagnostic centre it was a suggestion only as it was nearby but cost is completely dependent on the diagnostic centre. Also if you felt it was expensive there was no compulsion to get test done from the place. You are always free to choose any diagnostic centre of your own choice.\n          As far consultation fees it is a structured thing that is followed for every patient. Your first consultation was on 1st August and next on 6th August. I charge consultation fees again on the fifth day. If you had any problem with it you should have enquired or told me at that time. We could have easily settled the issue. Still if there was any error in calculating the days from my staff, I am sorry but otherwise it is a norm for every patient. \n           I am sorry that you had a bad experience but we wish that you had expressed your concern at that time so that any misunderstanding could have been easily resolved.\n",

He brought back my mother from a near-vegetative state to her usual buoyant self. During a span of three years, my 80-year-old mother fractured both sides of her hip; had an infected gallbladder that had to be removed; was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s; suffered from dementia, and silently slid into deep depression. She stopped talking and eating, became immobilized and was unable to control her bodily fluids. Dr. Roy steered back her cognitive skills and with his team rebuilt her broken physical strength. Today she is walking, attending philosophy classes and taking an active interest in life. Dr. Sanchayan Roy returned my mother back to us!\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Roy is an excellent geriatric care doctor who combines short-term health problems with long-term continuum of care. He coordinated my mother\u2019s myriad medications for multiple age-related ailments to create a comprehensive health picture. Based on this he generated a preventive care regime that he enforces by reminding family members to act on it. His continuous care gives us hope that we might be able to mitigate some of my mother\u2019s anticipated health issues by replacing it with a better quality of life. Dr. Roy truly takes his Hippocratic oath seriously (a rare quality these days).\n\nHaving experienced healthcare in many parts of the world, I can say without hesitation that our experience with Dr. Roy ranks among the best, and I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending him to my friends and to their aging parents. I can cite my experience with Dr. Sanchayan Roy and his team of doctor\u2019s as a blessing!",

Many a time I have had to take quick action when she has suddenly collapsed or fallen without warning. My first response is to call Dr. Sanchayan Roy even before informing her family members. He has always picked up the phone and guided me as to what I need to do to stabilize her. He then either sends an ambulance or arrives himself at his earliest convenience, depending on the severity of the situation. He takes full responsibility of the actions needed. Courtesy Dr. Sanchayan Roy\u2019s consistent involvement in the health and wellbeing of my employer I am able to fulfill my duties with care and confidence. I have to admit, without Dr. Roy\u2019s medical support, I might not have accepted this challenging assignment. To me he is the \u201cMiracle Man\u201d! \n",

So before coming to a social media had you asked relevant questions and doubts about the medication and diagnosis it would have been better. The brands of medicine recommended were generic brands too but there is no compulsion to buy that brand only. You can choose alternative brands. Again you could have asked for alternative brands if required. It would be better in future if you clarify these things with your treating doctor.",

Regarding diagnostic centre it was a suggestion only as it was nearby but cost is completely dependent on the diagnostic centre. Also if you felt it was expensive there was no compulsion to get test done from the place. You are always free to choose any diagnostic centre of your own choice.\n          As far consultation fees it is a structured thing that is followed for every patient. Your first consultation was on 1st August and next on 6th August. I charge consultation fees again on the fifth day. If you had any problem with it you should have enquired or told me at that time. We could have easily settled the issue. Still if there was any error in calculating the days from my staff, I am sorry but otherwise it is a norm for every patient. \n           I am sorry that you had a bad experience but we wish that you had expressed your concern at that time so that any misunderstanding could have been easily resolved.\n",

Clinic is a place where symptomatic, infected and non infected cases come. The physical barrier is to screen and  understand the problems before examining to be able to segregate the infected from non infected patients. Covid appropriate behaviour shouldn't be tagged as 'scared', it shows lack of awareness. Anyway I don't remember the details of tests but I guess it is a matter of opinion regarding what is necessary and what isn't. Anyway I am sorry if you  found it unnecessary but I recommend what is generally necessary.",

But Dr. Sanchayan Roy made sure I didn\u2019t feel vulnerable. He held my hand and carefully guided me through the maze of my multiple age-related ailments. \n\nFor more than six years he has successfully treated my short-term problems that keep cropping up now and then, while continuing to manage my long-term chronic problems with unbelievable care and compassion. He listens attentively to what I have to say and answers my random questions patiently. His attention to ensure my well-being is exceptional. Due to the excellent care I have received, my every medical nightmare has changed into a promising dream. \n\nThough both sides of my hip are broken and I have eight broken ribs, Dr. Roy has made me feel physically, mentally and emotionally strong\u2026 so strong that now I want to live to see my great-grandchildren get married!
