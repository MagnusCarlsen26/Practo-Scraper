"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,Value for money,","Consultation,",0,0,YES,"In the heart of a bustling Gurgaon neighborhood is a clinic called Upchaar Wellness that was not just a place for healing but a sanctuary for those in need of understanding and compassionate care. 
This is where I met Dr. Rajiva Gupta , an internal medicine doctor whose reputation for excellence was well known throughout the community.

As, I made my way to the clinic, a second time in seven months feeling a mix of anxiety and hope. My health had been a rollercoaster for months, with symptoms that seemed to confound everyone I'd consulted. As I stepped into the warm, inviting reception area, a sense of calm began to wash over me, a precursor to the exceptional experience that awaited.

Dr. Gupta greeted me with a smile that felt both professional and genuinely kind, an amalgamation of qualities not often found in tandem. From the outset, it was clear that he was a listener, a trait I would soon learn was the bedrock of his practice. He didn't rush through the consultation. Instead, he took his time, ensuring that every word I said was heard and every concern I had was addressed.

The consultation room was a reflection of Dr. Gupta’s approach to medicine: organized, serene, and equipped with the latest technology, yet it felt as comfortable as a living room. As we discussed my health, I was struck by his methodical yet empathetic approach. He wove together my medical history, symptoms, and concerns with the skill of a master storyteller, making complex medical information understandable and less intimidating.

Dr. Gupta’s diagnosis and tests that he recommended were thorough, backed by a clear explanation and a detailed plan for my path forward. He answered all my questions with patience and an evident depth of knowledge, making me feel involved in my treatment plan. His approach was not just about addressing the symptoms but understanding the person behind them, a holistic approach that was both refreshing and reassuring.

As the visit came to a close, Dr. Gupta shared a few words of encouragement that felt tailor-made for my situation. It wasn't just his medical expertise that left an impact; it was his remarkable ability to connect on a human level, making me feel seen and understood.

Leaving the clinic that day, I felt a renewed sense of hope. My journey to recovery was just beginning, but I knew I had found a doctor in Dr. Gupta  who was not just a physician but a trusted ally.

This experience wasn't just about a medical consultation; it was a testament to the power of compassionate care. I only believe in holistic treatments with an allopathic diagnosis. Living in the US over the last 18 years have made me very aware of how chronic conditions are mostly treated with  medications which could leave a patient dependent on those for life.

Dr. Gupta exemplified what it means to be a remarkable internal medicine doctor - a beacon of knowledge, empathy, and support.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Numbness and tingling,",0,0,YES,"I just can't say enough about the skill, effectiveness and impact of Dr. Rajiva Gupta. I have visited medical professionals in several countries around the world, especially the U.S. and after my recent experience I would trust him entirely with my health.

I took the husband of my house help, for diagnosis, to Dr. Gupta.  The patient had been suffering from odd, severe and unpredictable body aches for over a year. He wasn't able to work and it had impacted the mental health of him and his family.  After seeing various doctors in this area,  he had resigned himself to a ""no-cure"" situation.  Another doctor had told him to just get used to it.  I brought him to Dr. Gupta.  I was fortunate, for the sake of this patient, that I found Dr, Gupta.  His direct style and reassuring manner, allowed him to get key clues on what could possibly be happening.  A series of tests later, he had correctly diagnosed that it was a case of rheumatoid arthritis, with potential to be treated before and help restore health.  (A specialist later confirmed this).  WHile this seems simple on the surface, the key was identifying the types of tests needed without going overboard.  Many of these clues had been missed by prior doctors.  Thirty days of medication later, the patient is back at work!!  Need I say more?

Personally I like Dr. Gupta's direct style.  His focus on helping the patient first is very refreshing.  And the end of the day, a Doctor's capabilities trump everything.  I would trust him with my health and I share this in the hope that this helps others looking to overcome health challenges.",2023-03-20 08:53:13,False,True,Sanjay,Thx and pl take care,2023-03-20T14:32:53+0000,Dr. Rajiva Gupta

It was difficult to see a doctor personally during that time given that she was tested positive for Covid and we do not live in a Metro city where quality healthcare is available. We started searching for a good Internal Medicine Dr online and came to know about Dr Rajiva Gupta. We scheduled an online appointment and started consulting with him over video calls. In November 2020 my mother became very sick. We called Dr Rajiva and he picked up our call despite being out of India. He saw my mom over video and advised us to admit her immediately to a hospital. We were able to take my mom to a hospital and treat her on time before her condition could get worse. We truly thank Dr Rajiva for responding to us on time and help us save my Mom’s life that night.

My Mom again became sick in July 2022. She had fever with chills. We thought she may have viral fever. Next day her blood pressure started dropping and I texted Dr Rajiva. He not only responded to my text but also spoke with me over phone even though he was traveling. He advised us to admit my Mom to a hospital. My Mom got treatment on time before her condition could get worse. Once again Dr. Rajiva helped us in a crucial time.

Dr Rajiva is very kind. He listens to you no matter how many questions you ask. The best part of him is being reachable when you need his advice to make right decision. I am totally dependent on him for my Mom’s healthcare. We are thankful to have him as our family doctor.

There may be back to back consultation on the Practo in successive slots because of which immediate delivery of the prescription may not be feasible.
