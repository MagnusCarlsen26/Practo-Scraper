I'd been struggling with persistent acne for months and felt discouraged by over-the-counter treatments.\n\nFrom the moment I walked in, the staff was incredibly welcoming and professional. The receptionist answered all my questions thoroughly, and the clinic itself had a very clean and calming atmosphere.\n\nDr. Gaurav Saini was fantastic! They took the time to listen to my concerns and thoroughly examine my skin. They explained my acne in a way that was easy to understand and discussed different treatment options. I never felt rushed during the consultation.\n\nDr. Gaurav created a personalized treatment plan that included a combination of topical medications and adjustments to my skincare routine. They also addressed my concerns about potential side effects and made sure I felt comfortable with everything.",
