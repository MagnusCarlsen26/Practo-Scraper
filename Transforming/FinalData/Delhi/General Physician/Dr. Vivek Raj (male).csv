,,0,0,YES,*** ***** *** ** *** ** *** *** ******* ** ****** * ***** *** ** ** ****** ** We have consulted him on two occasions. The first consultation was for my mother and 2 other hospitals could not treat the intestinal infection. Dr. Vivek Raj with one weeks medication and few tests treated my mother. He is friendly and to the point and also expalins the problem in detail. The second consultation was for myself and again he treated me in a weeks time with medications only and no tests. I had consulted 2 other doctors before going to him and they were not able to cure my gastro and intestinal infection problem.I recommend the doctor. 5 stars. You may feel he is a bit expensive but it is totally worth it. ,2021-09-21 09:22:53,False,True,Amit Sharma,,,
,,0,0,YES,"** ***** *** ** ** ********* ******* goes thru the minutest of the details, listens  to you with complete attention and recommends the Test mandatory and once the diagnosis is done based on his experience he suggests a complete treatment and  communicates that to the patients very effectively.  A matured Doctor whom one can TRUST! ",2022-08-29 07:14:24,False,True,Devinder Kumar ,,,
