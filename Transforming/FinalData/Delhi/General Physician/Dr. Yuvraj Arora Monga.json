I reached the clinic for the appointment but a junior Ayurvedic doctor consulted me. On demanding that Dr. Monga meet me, Doctor Monga did eventually come out and apologise because he had some family emergency. But it was a frustrating experience and I felt like the clinic was scamming me. I had congestion and fever since last 3 days and needed an Allopathic doctor to examine me. ",

The truth is that all the charges that were asked for were paid at times. If his staff missed on including these charges, then it is not our fault. However, when reminded, we cleared the charges and the doctor's attitude was not professional at all. BAD EXPERIENCE!",

The truth is that all the charges that were asked for were paid at times. If his staff missed on including these charges, then it is not our fault. However, when reminded, we cleared the charges and the doctor's attitude was not professional at all. BAD EXPERIENCE!",

Aside to this I needed to go under medication to lower down my pressure and failed to notice the urge of sex drive in me. Such conditions disappointed my wife completely and I was worried about my family life and started becoming alcoholic. One day I shared my problem with mchildhood friend and he doubted that I was suffering from Loss of Libido. He asked me to meet Dr.Yuvraj Aror immediately. I took appointment and consulted him and he asked me to go for testosterone test and it came low. After checking report he asked me to calm down and start meditation for stress reduction and also guided me what I should do. His Counseling was so powerful for me that I have started noticing changes in me in few months time. I am free from performance anxiety and now I am happy and making my wife happy on bed. All Thanks to Dr.Yuvraj.",

I reached there on time, there was only one person who told me doctor comes at 12 and also that Dr. Yuvraj comes only on 2 days., so another dr. will meet you.I mean whats the transparency of practo and the clinic.They provide assured meet., which I dont think so is the case.... or may bI do not dis respect any doctor, but if you have searched something  on internet and then booked an appointment so you want to meet that person only.Also practo/monga clinic  please do not provide time slots in which doctors are not available and also please make sure that if a person is booking for a doctor, you schedule an appointment with that doctor only.So, as per my experience I will not recommend this.",

They asked me to complete too many exercises which would take around 3 hours of my time per day which is not really possible for me with my job and everything. at the start they said the treatment is very easy.
