He treated her as well and needless to say both of us have recovered well and without any hassles. \n\nCan't recommend him enough.

Despite the treatment for which I initially consulted him (throat infection), he also recommended natural remedies to ease pain and discomfort for my headache/migraine.\n\nHe is such a friendly person and my go to doctor as he always listens patiently to all my problems. As a physician he is extremely skilled and offers best treatment. Would definitely recommend him.",
