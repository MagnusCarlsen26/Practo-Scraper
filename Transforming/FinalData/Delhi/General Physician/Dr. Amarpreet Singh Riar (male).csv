First of all we are sorry that you weren‚Äôt satisfied with the staff you were in contact with.

We have verified everything that happened. 
We got in touch with the concerned receptionist and the lab as well. 
And it turned out that you have compiled a bundle of lies just because you were refused a Free consult.

1.Consult Fees is 800 RS and follow up is not charged till 5 days from anyone . Those 5 days are for getting any tests done in between or any other issue that may arise in between . You had consulted on 19 February last and now you wanted a free follow up after 17 days which is not normal. So the receptionist told you have to pay the fees which is pretty normal thing. I don‚Äôt know why you were forcing him to get you a free consultation. 

2.Secondly , you yourself called the clinic to get tests done. And you wanted tests collected from your home which is very very far away from our clinic and staff was short due to Holi. However , we still sent someone to collect your tests and you were informed of the prices before. We confirmed with the lab and you were charged usual prices and nothing extra. 

3.Now coming to the price , we have the bill with us. It‚Äôs 1600 for the multiple medicines for entire month . 50/day therapy for very high quality drugs is just normal and I don‚Äôt see anything wrong there. 800 was the fees , so total was around 2400.

4.If you want a Free Consult or you do not have the funds , you could request the receptionist for the same. Hundreds of patients are seen free or at discounted prices wherever we know that the patient genuinely cannot afford .But you cannot threaten or use abusive language. We won‚Äôt be blackmailed like that. 

5.We respect our patients as well as our staff equally. You were looking for a reconsult after 17 days from the initial consult. If you didn‚Äôt like the services in the beginning , why were you looking to consult again ? 

Our Analysis of Everything - if you were given a free consultation 17 days after your initial consult - you wouldn‚Äôt have maligned us.
