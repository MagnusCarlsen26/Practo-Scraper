My reports were not good but thanks to doctor Usha Gupta I was not required to be taken to the hospital when there were no hospital beds available in Delhi NCR. She suggested the right tests at the right time which helped her prescribe me the right medicines at the right time. She treated me like I was her own kid. Thank you doctor Usha Gupta ",

My reports were not good but thanks to doctor Usha Gupta I was not required to be taken to the hospital when there were no hospital beds available in Delhi NCR. She suggested the right tests at the right time which helped her prescribe me the right medicines at the right time. She treated me like I was her own kid. Thank you doctor Usha Gupta ",
