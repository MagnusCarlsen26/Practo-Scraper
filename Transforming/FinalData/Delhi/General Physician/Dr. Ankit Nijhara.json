After talking to multiple\u00a0people, we decided\u00a0to reach our Dr. Ankit Nijhara. When I interacted with him for the\u00a0first time, he listened to me very calmly and understood my condition. After\u00a0that, he suggested and explained to me the treatment\u00a0and related procedure very thoroughly.\n\nWith his guidance, I recovered swiftly and didn\u2019t face any post Covid complications.\n\nAfter that,\u00a0my mother and father tested\u00a0positive and I reached out to\u00a0Dr. Ankit Nijhara again. Considering the age of my parents (60+ years), he spent a decent\u00a0amount of time understanding their medical history and existing\u00a0medications.\u00a0\n\nAfter\u00a0analysing their past and current medical condition, he suggested the treatment which helped them to recover swiftly without any complications. We feel really fortunate to get our Covid 19 treatment from\u00a0Dr. Ankit Nijhara. Even in such unprecedented times, he responded to each and every query very carefully and well on time.\n\nI really appreciate his dedication, medical knowledge and way of treating patients. Kudos to Dr. Ankit.\u00a0\n",

After talking to multiple\u00a0people, we decided\u00a0to reach our Dr. Ankit Nijhara. When I interacted with him for the\u00a0first time, he listened to me very calmly and understood my condition. After\u00a0that, he suggested and explained to me the treatment\u00a0and related procedure very thoroughly.\n\nWith his guidance, I recovered swiftly and didn\u2019t face any post Covid complications.\n\nAfter that,\u00a0my mother and father tested\u00a0positive and I reached out to\u00a0Dr. Ankit Nijhara again. Considering the age of my parents (60+ years), he spent a decent\u00a0amount of time understanding their medical history and existing\u00a0medications.\u00a0\n\nAfter\u00a0analysing their past and current medical condition, he suggested the treatment which helped them to recover swiftly without any complications. We feel really fortunate to get our Covid 19 treatment from\u00a0Dr. Ankit Nijhara. Even in such unprecedented times, he responded to each and every query very carefully and well on time.\n\nI really appreciate his dedication, medical knowledge and way of treating patients. Kudos to Dr. Ankit.\u00a0\n",
