You were regularly in touch with her on whatsapp.Next time I saw him ..the diagnosis at our center is based on pathological tests not on conjectures and as fever was recurring I diagnosed as UTI because infection in urine was there. He was advised to check fever regularly and report sos .In his reports which you brought no other infection was positive till that time .So I fail to understand what you are complaining about. Also anybody who takes medicine from clinic( which is optional) gets bill for that so if you have forgotten to take the bill you are most welcome to take it or send your email id we will post it.I request you to consider first what your grievances are then write a story.

The clinic is a diabetes clinic, but I chose to visit them as it showed they are general physicians and well experienced.I took an appointment to meet the doctor, however upon reaching the clinic, I met his his wife and she was the one who looked at the reports and provided for the meds and everything. Mind you, I was to meet the husband and not her. We trusted her as we saw a lot of certificates in the clinic.They provided meds and would want u to purchase the same from their clinic itself, without providing a bill (I didn't really bother asking for it as I was more concerned in getting the treatment done). She gave us 2 separate meds, apart from what she mentioned in the prescription, to be taken twice and thrice a day, which had no proper packing and was in a packet.I was greeted by the husband the 2nd time when I visited the doc(the actual person for whom I took the appointment with to begin with). He too had a look at the reports and diagnosed my fiance for UTI.

Dr. Khanna assured us he will get opinion of Urologist as necessary in treatment. However with each visit our perception for Dr. Khanna changed. He seem to be very rude in behavior, slowly we became scared of sharing problems with him. We had felt he was indirectly telling us to buy medicines from his clinic (in-house pharmacy) & get test done there itself. This became evident when on a follow up visit to show reports, he forcefully took prescription from my wife's hand when we insisted him to write generic name of medicines. He asked us angrily to pay consultation again and 2% extra for card payment. Before our 1st visit, I had read reviews and those were either highly positive or extremely negative, I was skeptical but still gave it a shot and regretted later.

So request you to not misguide people as you are yourself not clear in your facts. At my center our aim is to keep sugar well within advised limits which we achieve in 99 percent of the cooperative patients. That's why we get a constant flow of national and international patients. I request you to avoid writing such things which might misguide a deserving patient from getting good treatment. If really there is a father of yours suffering from uncontrolled Diabetes you are most welcome to bring him and get quality treatment. Also please disclose your name. ",

Blood sugar charges and all other charges are boldly displayed at reception. \n3. Medicines are only given after asking the patients there is no compulsion.In fact only 10 percent of my patients take medicine from my center.\n4. You have written 4000 rs medicines for bloating of abdomen which is highly exaggerated you have taken only 400 rs medicine is this mistake of zero.\nIn the end my sincere advise to you is that is is very easy to write a feedback to defame anybody but it should me true.\nIt pains me to see all false allegations. \nwith warm regards \nDr Amitabh Khanna\n",

He also replied to my queries in whatsapp.Last time when I was there with my father, he was leaving in his car. But he stopped, came back to his cabin & checked with us. Such a kind person.  I read few comments that he forces to buy medicine from there only. People, just stop maligning such a nice person. I never felt such thing & in fact I was happy that I got all my medicines there only. Else I had to roam around in search of medicines. By mistake I broke a cup flower base  :P I will gift at the clinic next time.",

You were regularly in touch with her on whatsapp.Next time I saw him ..the diagnosis at our center is based on pathological tests not on conjectures and as fever was recurring I diagnosed as UTI because infection in urine was there. He was advised to check fever regularly and report sos .In his reports which you brought no other infection was positive till that time .So I fail to understand what you are complaining about. Also anybody who takes medicine from clinic( which is optional) gets bill for that so if you have forgotten to take the bill you are most welcome to take it or send your email id we will post it.I request you to consider first what your grievances are then write a story.

Mind you, I was to meet the husband and not her. We trusted her as we saw a lot of certificates in the clinic.They provided meds and would want u to purchase the same from their clinic itself, without providing a bill (I didn't really bother asking for it as I was more concerned in getting the treatment done). She gave us 2 separate meds, apart from what she mentioned in the prescription, to be taken twice and thrice a day, which had no proper packing and was in a packet.I was greeted by the husband the 2nd time when I visited the doc(the actual person for whom I took the appointment with to begin with).

Dr. Khanna assured us he will get opinion of Urologist as necessary in treatment. However with each visit our perception for Dr. Khanna changed. He seem to be very rude in behavior, slowly we became scared of sharing problems with him. We had felt he was indirectly telling us to buy medicines from his clinic (in-house pharmacy) & get test done there itself. This became evident when on a follow up visit to show reports, he forcefully took prescription from my wife's hand when we insisted him to write generic name of medicines. He asked us angrily to pay consultation again and 2% extra for card payment. Before our 1st visit, I had read reviews and those were either highly positive or extremely negative, I was skeptical but still gave it a shot and regretted later. I could never understand, why does he need to check sugar on spot with similar machine that patient is using at home, while patient is carrying whole chart ***** ** ****** *** **** * ******* ** ** ****** ** **** * ********** ***** ******** *** ***** **** *** *** ***** *** ********* *** ****** **** ******** **** ********* *** ***** ********** ***** **** I have seen his  response to other negative reviews, but this story need to be told ** ****** ***** **** ***** ********* ** ****** *** ** **** ** *** **** ****** ******* ** *** *** **** ** ** **** ** ****** ********* **** *** ****** * **** *** *********** **** ************* ****** Good luck !!",

So request you to not misguide people as you are yourself not clear in your facts. At my center our aim is to keep sugar well within advised limits which we achieve in 99 percent of the cooperative patients. That's why we get a constant flow of national and international patients. I request you to avoid writing such things which might misguide a deserving patient from getting good treatment.

Blood sugar charges and all other charges are boldly displayed at reception. \n3. Medicines are only given after asking the patients there is no compulsion.In fact only 10 percent of my patients take medicine from my center.\n4. You have written 4000 rs medicines for bloating of abdomen which is highly exaggerated you have taken only 400 rs medicine is this mistake of zero.\nIn the end my sincere advise to you is that is is very easy to write a feedback to defame anybody but it should me true.\nIt pains me to see all false allegations. \nwith warm regards \nDr Amitabh Khanna\n",

He also replied to my queries in whatsapp.Last time when I was there with my father, he was leaving in his car. But he stopped, came back to his cabin & checked with us. Such a kind person.  I read few comments that he forces to buy medicine from there only. People, just stop maligning such a nice person. I never felt such thing & in fact I was happy that I got all my medicines there only. Else I had to roam around in search of medicines. By mistake I broke a cup flower base  :P I will gift at the clinic next time.",

Whoever Visited me was not nitin you are writing this on somebody else's behalf .\n2.proctoscopy is examination of anus by surgeons so improve your medical knowledge before posting review.\n3.Again improve your knowledge of medical field I'm Dpcard( equivalent to MD) and then many super specialisation courses from abroad. Plus service in Indian Army and 30 years of experience. So check before you speak derogatory about anybody.\n4.Weird thing I find that one person who don't like a small thing makes it a point to write a negative review but thousands of oversatisfied patient never do. I think they should also takeout time.\n5. In your case the main problem appears to be that you had to pay again. Mr... Who visited me for throat infection came back after 6 days and said he requires a medical which I refused saying how can you skip office for 6 days for a simple throat infection. Consult again and if I find reason only then I'll give medical.\n6. I request you to not make stories only for this reason it's clearly written at my reception all visits are payable.\nHave a nice day",

The diagnosis was about fever *** **** ******* However, there were 2 things which I found really weird: First, the doctor asked me to buy the medicines from his chemist shop, once I said I will buy it from a chemist outside, he took back the prescription paper saying he wants to see it once and threw it in the dustbin and wrote a completely new prescription with different set of medicines. Second weird thing was, even if you visit the doctor again the next day he charges consultation charges of 900/- every time you visit him. I wanted to get a fitness certificate (to give to my office) he again charged 900/- consultation just for fitness certificate. I found it a little bit weird.

Fortunately, I was the first patient there and was highly impressed with sanitization and social distancing managed at the place. (Dwarka Clinic)\n\nDr. Khanna listened to my case history with patience and went through the reports in detail. Due to my anxiety for good treatment, I asked him some things repeatedly to which he replied promptly.\n\nMaybe I used some extra time for sharing and repeating the things (I am sorry for that) but he listened to them every time and prescribed the medicines accordingly.\n\nNext, we were explained in detail about the diet regime and importance of physical activity (trust me all the things suggested by them are highly easy to do and it will not impact your lifestyle or food habits). - I can eat everything barring sugar only.\n\nI am looking forward to improving my health and have a long-term relationship with Khanna sir. \n\nGod bless you for serving the needy and sorry for being repetitive.\n",

You can't be choosy about the medicines you have to take all that is prescribed. So this time you were specifically told to take medicine for one month from here so that I can see that with proper medication her sugar goes down or not. I told you clearly that my patient's well being is first priority so please take medicine from here so that I know you are eating medicines. Otherwise look for some other Dr who just write medicine and finishes the job.",
