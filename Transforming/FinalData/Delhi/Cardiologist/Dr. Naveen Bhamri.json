All necessary tests were conducted within a matter of hours. \nDr. Bhamri informed us about the case complications and also the possible treatments available for it. \nHis ********* *********, detailed explanations, accompanied by diagrams reassured us that we were in safe hands. \nAnd while he briefed us about all possible treatments, he allowed us to choose the treatment that we wanted to go for which clearly told us that he is a non-commercial doctor. \nSince ours was a complicated case, he researched and sought the help of other senior Cardiologists like Dr. Balbir Singh for carrying out the surgical procedure. He also lined up at least three back up support teams and necessary infrastructure to ensure that the procedure is carried out successfully. \nDr. Bhamri personally supervised the post surgery recovery calling up every few hours to check on my husband\u2019s condition. \nEven when we were discharged from the hospital, his office called up to check about my husband\u2019s well being. \nA dynamic combination of dedication, commitment and medical expertise- that\u2019s Dr. Naveen Bhamri for you\u2757\ufe0f\nThank you sir for everything\u2757\ufe0f We are eternally grateful to you and your team of Cardiology. \nWe are also immensely thankful to Dr. Pankaj, Dr. Gaurav, Dr. Sudhanshu and Dr. Aggarwal for guiding us, treating us and motivating us. \nThank you Doctors\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nGagan and Shruti Gupta \nDelhi",

Back then, we went to one of the renowned heart hospital in New Jersey for the angioplasty which didn't really get successful due to 100% blockage. After reaching back to India, every day was so difficult with my mom in terms of walking, breathing etc., making us pursue again the angioplasty at one of the top notch hospital  in cardiology at national level.The doctors over there too weren't really able to place stents due to 100% blockage. We lost all hopes and have almost accepted the fate of multiple medicines paralleled with side effects for the entire life.That was the time when we got to know about you Dr. Naveen Bhamri (Max, Shalimar Bhagh - Delhi). You and your team have strategized the procedure and on the final day (15 Nov 2022) enagaged for close to two hours and made the impossible as 'successfully possible'. You have solved the problem while minimizing the risk.My mom is really lucky to have your hands on her heart problem.  She at times refer you as the \"King of Hearts\" and never gets tired admiring your nature and intellect. Many thanks Dr. Naveen Bhamri for all the good work you have been doing in this critical field of Medical Science.Regards,Dr. Rohit GuptaSonipat, Haryana",

All necessary tests were conducted within a matter of hours. \nDr. Bhamri informed us about the case complications and also the possible treatments available for it. \nHis ********* *********, detailed explanations, accompanied by diagrams reassured us that we were in safe hands. \nAnd while he briefed us about all possible treatments, he allowed us to choose the treatment that we wanted to go for which clearly told us that he is a non-commercial doctor. \nSince ours was a complicated case, he researched and sought the help of other senior Cardiologists like Dr. Balbir Singh for carrying out the surgical procedure. He also lined up at least three back up support teams and necessary infrastructure to ensure that the procedure is carried out successfully. \nDr. Bhamri personally supervised the post surgery recovery calling up every few hours to check on my husband\u2019s condition. \nEven when we were discharged from the hospital, his office called up to check about my husband\u2019s well being. \nA dynamic combination of dedication, commitment and medical expertise- that\u2019s Dr. Naveen Bhamri for you\u2757\ufe0f\nThank you sir for everything\u2757\ufe0f We are eternally grateful to you and your team of Cardiology. \nWe are also immensely thankful to Dr. Pankaj, Dr. Gaurav, Dr. Sudhanshu and Dr. Aggarwal for guiding us, treating us and motivating us. \nThank you Doctors\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nGagan and Shruti Gupta \nDelhi",

Back then, we went to one of the renowned heart hospital in New Jersey for the angioplasty which didn't really get successful due to 100% blockage. After reaching back to India, every day was so difficult with my mom in terms of walking, breathing etc., making us pursue again the angioplasty at one of the top notch hospital  in cardiology at national level.The doctors over there too weren't really able to place stents due to 100% blockage. We lost all hopes and have almost accepted the fate of multiple medicines paralleled with side effects for the entire life.That was the time when we got to know about you Dr. Naveen Bhamri (Max, Shalimar Bhagh - Delhi). You and your team have strategized the procedure and on the final day (15 Nov 2022) enagaged for close to two hours and made the impossible as 'successfully possible'. You have solved the problem while minimizing the risk.My mom is really lucky to have your hands on her heart problem.  She at times refer you as the \"King of Hearts\" and never gets tired admiring your nature and intellect. Many thanks Dr. Naveen Bhamri for all the good work you have been doing in this critical field of Medical Science.Regards,Dr. Rohit GuptaSonipat, Haryana",

But DR Bhamri n his team has successfully done the angioplasty. And most importantly , his behavior is very good. So I recommend Dr Bhamri for cardiac problems.",
