My mother got chest pain on 13th March 2017 and considering this heart attack, we admitted her into a local hospital in Vasundhara Ghaziabad. Doctors on duty, discharged her with conclusion as cervical pain. 7 days later, she encounter with another severe chest pain which was concluded as Heart Attack and identified through ECG on 21 March. All doctors, whom we met during first 25 days, either prescribed medicine with assured recovery through medicine or advised us to refrain of Angiography as heart with EF as 30% is weak and surgery may result fetal. We got scared really and decided to meet with Dr. Vivek Gupta at his Sarita Vihar clinic for another opinion.\nThis was the Turing point for us. We met Dr. Gupta and described the entire situation along with our fear on risk, that other are advising. Dr. Gupta listened all our queries and answered every single question very patiently.  He also assured us that nothing has gone out of control, we can still perform Angiography without any known risk. This meeting relaxed entire of family and there we decided to go with Dr. Gupta.\nFinally she was admitted in Apollo on 14 April where Dr. Vivek performed the Angiography and Angioplasty at the same time. Key point to note was, that Dr. Vivek has kept the entire process so transparent that we are aware of every step that is being performed during operation. \n\nWorth mentioning is the transparency shown by Prof Gupta once again related to some flow disturbance during the procedure which was well managed by his team. He had no hesitation in informing this as well to us. This is where experience and confidence counts. \n\nAfter 4 days of stay in Apollo, mother was discharged with lot of blessing to Dr. Vivek Gupta for all his support and help. My mother has recovered well now and with 4 weeks gone she is doing well. \n\nLast but not the least, I would highly recommend, Dr, Vivek Gupta for all Cardio related issues. ** ** *** **** ************* ****** *** **** a very nice humankind. He keeps conversation positive but keep you updated with real situation (including risks) of your patient. Best part is, when you speak to him, you feel that he is part of your family. God bless Dr. Vivek Gupta for being with us and bringing us out from trauma situation.",
