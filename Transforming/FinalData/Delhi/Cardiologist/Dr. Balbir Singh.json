                "review_text": "Well I would like to say that Dr.Balbir  and his team is best at what they do and what they promise. We met the doctor in 'Medanta the medicity'. Doctor is very busy everyday and you should not go without appointments. It is very crowded and you need to literally wait for hours if you do not have an appointment. Dr.Balbir is very experienced . I took my mother to Doctor Balbir, because my mother was suffering from Takaysu Arteritis she has blockages in various major arteries. Before coming to the doctor Balbir we had also shown to many of the doctors and none of the doctor wanted to do angioplasty and there was a huge risk of life loss involved in it. But Dr.Balbir said he will put stunts in my mothers' body in various arteries and she would be fine. We were really happy as after so much of bad news atlas somebody said that she could recover. Doctor decide to place overall six stunts in my mothers body 4 one at a time and 2 more stunts after the gap on 3 months. To which we agreed. \r\n\r\nMy mother got admitted in the hospital after the date given by the doctor. The operations were very risky and i would say that doctor and their team are expert in their work. And both the time operation was success full.  Now mother had 6 stunts in her body. I was happy with the doctor and his efforts. But i would also like to give one suggestion that only doing the partial job is not the complete job. It would have been great as the doctor already knew that my mother has okays Arteritis, so after the angioplasty they should have recommended any good Rheumatologist so that no further stunting was required and from that time proper treatment could have started. But as i said these people are best in their field so may be short of time. \r\n\r\nAlso i was unhappy with the way the patient is treated after the surgery. Immediately after the surgery when my mother was still in the bath lab, there was no body to inform that what has happened and what further steps needs to be taken. Because this is not just the blockages it is due to certain disease due to which these blockages are occurring and re-occuring. So keeping in mind patient's health a complete guidance should be provided to the patient. Also it is very difficult to talk to the doctor and his secretary also does not have any proper info. So i would definitely recommend doctor Balbir to everybody has as he is one of the experts in the country. But a little more care for their patient would have been more helpful. This is the reason i gave three stars would have been definitely five stars if all the above are taken care.",

Doctor is very busy everyday and you should not go without appointments. It is very crowded and you need to literally wait for hours if you do not have an appointment. Dr.Balbir is very experienced . I took my mother to Doctor Balbir, because my mother was suffering from Takaysu Arteritis she has blockages in various major arteries. Before coming to the doctor Balbir we had also shown to many of the doctors and none of the doctor wanted to do angioplasty and there was a huge risk of life loss involved in it. But Dr.Balbir said he will put stunts in my mothers' body in various arteries and she would be fine. We were really happy as after so much of bad news atlas somebody said that she could recover. Doctor decide to place overall six stunts in my mothers body 4 one at a time and 2 more stunts after the gap on 3 months. To which we agreed. \r\n\r\nMy mother got admitted in the hospital after the date given by the doctor. The operations were very risky and i would say that doctor and their team are expert in their work. And both the time operation was success full.  Now mother had 6 stunts in her body. I was happy with the doctor and his efforts. But i would also like to give one suggestion that only doing the partial job is not the complete job. It would have been great as the doctor already knew that my mother has okays Arteritis, so after the angioplasty they should have recommended any good Rheumatologist so that no further stunting was required and from that time proper treatment could have started. But as i said these people are best in their field so may be short of time. \r\n\r\nAlso i was unhappy with the way the patient is treated after the surgery. Immediately after the surgery when my mother was still in the bath lab, there was no body to inform that what has happened and what further steps needs to be taken. Because this is not just the blockages it is due to certain disease due to which these blockages are occurring and re-occuring. So keeping in mind patient's health a complete guidance should be provided to the patient. Also it is very difficult to talk to the doctor and his secretary also does not have any proper info. So i would definitely recommend doctor Balbir to everybody has as he is one of the experts in the country. But a little more care for their patient would have been more helpful. This is the reason i gave three stars would have been definitely five stars if all the above are taken care.",

To any further question, he very rudely just repeated the same thing.\nVery unprofessional approach, very rude. Changed statement completely in 4 days. Not trustworthy",
