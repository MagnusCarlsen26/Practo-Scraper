But, Dr Amit never lost patience. I He kept trying new medicines, and finally, her BP was controlled.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Mitral/Heart Valve Replacement,",0,0,YES,"I have no words to thank Dr Amit Mittal. He gave my father a new lease of life.

My father was diagnosed with mitral valve regurgitation in 2023. A hospital can be a daunting place for anybody, especially for someone in their 70s'.

He was prescient with his diagnosis, excellent in his treatment and generous with giving us his time during those stressful days of hospitalization. The open-heart surgery and valve replacement went smoothly at Apollo and the post-operative care under his guidance was top notch. 

Even though my parents live in another part of the country, Dr Mittal is always responsive, reachable, just a call away, sparing his valuable time to still glance at test reports or take an occasional video call to give us his medical advice without charging a penny.

Even got a repeat ECG done. If Pauses are more then 2.5 - 3sec then its a guidelines based indication for pacemaker implantation.  However most of the patient wants to avoid invasive treatment thats why whole blame was put on doctor s. As far as explanation of the problem is concerned, i explained his son making the diagram of whole heart conduction system, still its they want to blame the doctor its upto them.
