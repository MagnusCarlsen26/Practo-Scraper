Despite the major underlying complexities, Doctor Vipul successfully coordinated with multiple specialists and took all possible precautionary measures to minimize the risk of surgery. Doctor Vipul successfully performed a PFN2 implant surgery. Due to the excellent nature of treatment provided my father was able to independently walk within two months of the surgery. God bless Doctor Vipul. ",

                "reply_text": "Dear pt\nYou had booked an appointment via Practo for a video consultation. And we had tried to connect to you four times via the app before even your first attempt and we have screen shots for the same.  If you have had previous Practo virtual consultations, you would be aware and you should understand, that the call not getting connected may not mean that somebody is disconnecting the calls, it may be a technical issue! If it is a technical issue with PRACTO, please contact the right channel to sort it out. PRACTO does not allow doctors to share personal WhatsApp number for completing the appointments.  But seeing the issue with the app, we still shared the clinic WhatsApp number to complete the consultation. And to put the facts straight, the call that you received to accommodate via WhatsApp was our initiative to serve you better. No communication received from Practo. Further, we have never faced any issue with our previous consultation on the platform. But even if you face an issue with a product, there are platforms to raise it, but here the same was never done.\nSecondly, dear Mr Khan, appointments are fixed till 11 pm and there were other in person appointments waiting after you. It is unwise that after spending 15 minutes to sort out the technical issue with the app, we delay other patients waiting after you. But still we paused appointments in between and were able to accommodate you at 8.15 pm. But you are posting false facts that the video call on app was disconnected.\nThirdly, and to the doctor\u2019s surprise, when we connected with you, you had already made your diagnosis, plan of treatment and prognosis for your disease yourself. When it was insisted that we discuss your symptoms, you were clear that you know your diagnosis and treatment and just need pain killers. This is apparent from your post here. You, yourself, state that you \u201cknow\u201d that the pain would subside in a week. We would have been more than happy to treat your disease as a whole, but you were not willing to have that discussion. We had tried to ask you umpteen number of times about your symptoms but there was no response. The doctor can start treatment if he is presented with symptoms, which unfortunately in this case were never presented. \nFourthly, any medication for pain relief is not meant to give you relief of pain instantly. But rather than waiting for the period the medication has been prescribed for, your eagerness to post immediately after a single dose, shows something amiss. Your first feedback for Dr Vipul Vijay came within 10 hours of taking the first dose of your medicine and on a separate platform. And after you had posted your feedback, you were asking follow up queries on the app, which were promptly replied to.  These point to something amiss in this consultation from your end.\nAnother limitation on the online consultation platforms is that we are allowed to prescribe only NSAIDs, no higher analgesics can be prescribed, until it is an in person consultation and after clinical examination. But in your hurry to post, within less than 10 hours of taking the medication, we are sure you would have missed that fact. Anyways, the platform via WhatsApp and Practo were both open, but your eagerness to post shows that you\u2019re not interested in having relief of treatment, just need vindication for your \u201cself diagnosis\u201d.\nWe do not believe in providing the highest pain killer at the first instance as we care for our patients and do not follow such irresponsible behavior, how much so the other party may force us to. You had already been prescribed the analgesics for your disease, had it been a communication through a proper channel, the restrictions in prescription of higher pain killers would have been clearly explained to you in detail (the same has already been communicated to you via the chat in the app). The practice guidelines for virtual consultation is an open document and clearly delineate the medications which can or cannot be prescribed via a virtual consult. \nYou had been clearly advised to see a \u201cclinician in person\u201d if the pain does not subside. You were never advised to visit a new one, but \u201cin person\u201d, but in your haste to post you must have missed that part.\nThis reply is to put all your facts in perspective. But would recommend to see the doctor with an open mind and in person so that your pain can be managed and further treatment initiated. We are still happy to serve you and wish you a speedy recovery.\nRegards",

I reported the issue to practo support after which I received a call from Dr. Vipul Vijay's clinic within few minutes that he has moved onto next appointment and he will call me on my whatsapp number once he gets free from his current appointments. I must explain that even this appointment of 6:45 P.M was an achievement after a good follow up, anyway I kept waiting until I finally received a call at about 8:15 P.M. I very categorically explained Dr. Vipul Vijay that it's a dull Shooting pain which is originating from Scapula & going down towards mid bicep.. basically this was a recurring issue of bicep tendonitis which had returned with a higher magnitude after 6 months as I was aware about the issue ... I requested him that all I need is something which should kill this wicked pain as I was unable to sleep for the whole night. He prescribed me Zerodol Sp, an Ointment & some gas busting DSR 150... & Guess what? I'm still unable to sleep ** ******* ** ****** **** *** **** *** *** ** *** *** ***** **** ******* ******** I'm adviced to visit after a week, Tbh 80% of Bicep tendonitis pain subsides within a week ****** **** ****** *** ***** ** ****** * ******** ***** ******** **** *** ******** ***** ** ** **** ****** *** but I'm still unable to sleep due to this shooting pain * ****** ** ******* ** *** ********* ** ******** Overall I'm not happy because I don't think I deserve to go through such a pain. ***** **** ****** *** * ****** ******** ** *** ** **** ** ********* **** ** ** ****** ** ******* *** ******** ********* ***** **** ***** ** *** **** ********** When he called on our watsapp number he was in such a hurry to get off the video call that I had to be focused on getting my medication, later he pins on practo & says I should be grateful that he called back.

But as would understand, that allergic reaction to any medicine is extremely difficult to predict. Until, of course, if you keep a track of all the medications that cause allergy to a person. Unfortunately, we did not have any of such records at hand in your mother\u2019s case. \nI am happy to hear that she had recovered from the medical condition she was being treated for. As far as I see from our records available with us, she had reported excellent relief of symptoms.\nShe was also advised to start physiotherapy to which she showed her inability to start, and hence pain relief had to be maintained on multi-vitamins which may have caused her allergy but allergic reactions to any allergen, be that pollen, dust fomites, even air pollutants can not be predicted. \nI do wish her speedy recovery and sincerely advise you to keep a track of the medicines causing allergic reactions to the patient, so that you are able to get her allergy related issues managed better in the future.\nI wish her good health and speedy recovery. \nSincere regards",

Despite the major underlying complexities, Doctor Vipul successfully coordinated with multiple specialists and took all possible precautionary measures to minimize the risk of surgery. Doctor Vipul successfully performed a PFN2 implant surgery. Due to the excellent nature of treatment provided my father was able to independently walk within two months of the surgery. God bless Doctor Vipul. ",

                "reply_text": "Dear pt\nYou had booked an appointment via Practo for a video consultation. And we had tried to connect to you four times via the app before even your first attempt and we have screen shots for the same.  If you have had previous Practo virtual consultations, you would be aware and you should understand, that the call not getting connected may not mean that somebody is disconnecting the calls, it may be a technical issue! If it is a technical issue with PRACTO, please contact the right channel to sort it out. PRACTO does not allow doctors to share personal WhatsApp number for completing the appointments.  But seeing the issue with the app, we still shared the clinic WhatsApp number to complete the consultation. And to put the facts straight, the call that you received to accommodate via WhatsApp was our initiative to serve you better. No communication received from Practo. Further, we have never faced any issue with our previous consultation on the platform. But even if you face an issue with a product, there are platforms to raise it, but here the same was never done.\nSecondly, dear Mr Khan, appointments are fixed till 11 pm and there were other in person appointments waiting after you. It is unwise that after spending 15 minutes to sort out the technical issue with the app, we delay other patients waiting after you. But still we paused appointments in between and were able to accommodate you at 8.15 pm. But you are posting false facts that the video call on app was disconnected.\nThirdly, and to the doctor\u2019s surprise, when we connected with you, you had already made your diagnosis, plan of treatment and prognosis for your disease yourself. When it was insisted that we discuss your symptoms, you were clear that you know your diagnosis and treatment and just need pain killers. This is apparent from your post here. You, yourself, state that you \u201cknow\u201d that the pain would subside in a week. We would have been more than happy to treat your disease as a whole, but you were not willing to have that discussion. We had tried to ask you umpteen number of times about your symptoms but there was no response. The doctor can start treatment if he is presented with symptoms, which unfortunately in this case were never presented. \nFourthly, any medication for pain relief is not meant to give you relief of pain instantly. But rather than waiting for the period the medication has been prescribed for, your eagerness to post immediately after a single dose, shows something amiss. Your first feedback for Dr Vipul Vijay came within 10 hours of taking the first dose of your medicine and on a separate platform. And after you had posted your feedback, you were asking follow up queries on the app, which were promptly replied to.  These point to something amiss in this consultation from your end.\nAnother limitation on the online consultation platforms is that we are allowed to prescribe only NSAIDs, no higher analgesics can be prescribed, until it is an in person consultation and after clinical examination. But in your hurry to post, within less than 10 hours of taking the medication, we are sure you would have missed that fact. Anyways, the platform via WhatsApp and Practo were both open, but your eagerness to post shows that you\u2019re not interested in having relief of treatment, just need vindication for your \u201cself diagnosis\u201d.\nWe do not believe in providing the highest pain killer at the first instance as we care for our patients and do not follow such irresponsible behavior, how much so the other party may force us to. You had already been prescribed the analgesics for your disease, had it been a communication through a proper channel, the restrictions in prescription of higher pain killers would have been clearly explained to you in detail (the same has already been communicated to you via the chat in the app). The practice guidelines for virtual consultation is an open document and clearly delineate the medications which can or cannot be prescribed via a virtual consult. \nYou had been clearly advised to see a \u201cclinician in person\u201d if the pain does not subside. You were never advised to visit a new one, but \u201cin person\u201d, but in your haste to post you must have missed that part.\nThis reply is to put all your facts in perspective. But would recommend to see the doctor with an open mind and in person so that your pain can be managed and further treatment initiated. We are still happy to serve you and wish you a speedy recovery.\nRegards",

I reported the issue to practo support after which I received a call from Dr. Vipul Vijay's clinic within few minutes that he has moved onto next appointment and he will call me on my whatsapp number once he gets free from his current appointments. I must explain that even this appointment of 6:45 P.M was an achievement after a good follow up, anyway I kept waiting until I finally received a call at about 8:15 P.M. I very categorically explained Dr. Vipul Vijay that it's a dull Shooting pain which is originating from Scapula & going down towards mid bicep.. basically this was a recurring issue of bicep tendonitis which had returned with a higher magnitude after 6 months as I was aware about the issue ... I requested him that all I need is something which should kill this wicked pain as I was unable to sleep for the whole night. He prescribed me Zerodol Sp, an Ointment & some gas busting DSR 150... & Guess what? I'm still unable to sleep ** ******* ** ****** **** *** **** *** *** ** *** *** ***** **** ******* ******** I'm adviced to visit after a week, Tbh 80% of Bicep tendonitis pain subsides within a week ****** **** ****** *** ***** ** ****** * ******** ***** ******** **** *** ******** ***** ** ** **** ****** *** but I'm still unable to sleep due to this shooting pain * ****** ** ******* ** *** ********* ** ******** Overall I'm not happy because I don't think I deserve to go through such a pain. ***** **** ****** *** * ****** ******** ** *** ** **** ** ********* **** ** ** ****** ** ******* *** ******** ********* ***** **** ***** ** *** **** ********** When he called on our watsapp number he was in such a hurry to get off the video call that I had to be focused on getting my medication, later he pins on practo & says I should be grateful that he called back. Can someone tell me why should I be grateful to such a doctor who dropped my call thrice? ***** ** **** ****** ******** **** ******* *** **** **** *** ** ******* ** ****** ******** **** ******** ******* ******* **** ** * ****** *** ****** *** ***** **** ********* ***** ******** **** ******** ******* ******* ** *** *** ** *** *** ***** ** ***** ** **** ****** ** *** ***** ***** *** *** *************** And I did not put any false information here, the fact is my call was disconnected 3 times either by Vipul. Besides if you have limitations on prescribing proper medicine than atleast inform the same to the customer. Bottom line pain didn't go, did it?

But as would understand, that allergic reaction to any medicine is extremely difficult to predict. Until, of course, if you keep a track of all the medications that cause allergy to a person. Unfortunately, we did not have any of such records at hand in your mother\u2019s case. \nI am happy to hear that she had recovered from the medical condition she was being treated for. As far as I see from our records available with us, she had reported excellent relief of symptoms.\nShe was also advised to start physiotherapy to which she showed her inability to start, and hence pain relief had to be maintained on multi-vitamins which may have caused her allergy but allergic reactions to any allergen, be that pollen, dust fomites, even air pollutants can not be predicted. \nI do wish her speedy recovery and sincerely advise you to keep a track of the medicines causing allergic reactions to the patient, so that you are able to get her allergy related issues managed better in the future.\nI wish her good health and speedy recovery. \nSincere regards",

We had discussed in detail and I had already told you that the cost of the injection is just the same as you had quoted and the rest are application charges. We, at our clinic, have properly displayed our charges and these were informed to you well in advance by me as well as my receptionist. We undertook the procedure after you had agreed and understood the whole cost involved.\n\nAs far as the application charges are concerned, the injection vial is futile if it does not reach the right site. This is not an intra muscular or intra venous injection but needs to infiltrated at the exact site of the pathology. I hope you understand that having the injection vial is different, and having the expertise to apply it to the right place is totally a different preposition. We have kept our application charges at/ below par with the other specialised centres. \n\nI am disappointed that even after spending adequate time discussing your pathology, the effects of the different types of injections and also discussing the detailed rehab protocol along with the whole cost and implications of the injection, you had this concern. \n\nI hope that I have been able to sort out your queries and wish you speedy recovery!!",

I took the earliest appointment and visited his clinic in Mayur Vihar . \nI was examined by the doctor at length and he discussed  my medical history as well. I am allergic to a number of medicines and was little reluctant towards medication so Dr. Vipul gave me just one medicine with an assurance that it doesn't have too many side effects.\nWith in two days after taking the medicine I found significant relief. I was very happy with the way he explained the condition and possible courses of treatment. ",

This is a dilemma which we are faced with everyday. \nWe believe that when a patient has sought a medical opinion, the symptoms warrant further investigations. The test are needed for diagnosing your issue and managing them better. We sincerely do not believe in ordering one investigation at a time and calling you again and again for follow ups. We start the treatment once we are sure about your diagnosis and further plan. \nUnfortunately, in our societal scenario, patients are disappointed if the investigations turn out to be negative!! \nAlso we neither have any blood collection facilities and nor MRI facilities at our facility and encourage patients to get their tests done at the place of their choice. \nWe sincerely wish you have relief from your symptoms with no investigations and your condition is diagnosed and treated without any investigations.\nWish you a speedy recovery.",
