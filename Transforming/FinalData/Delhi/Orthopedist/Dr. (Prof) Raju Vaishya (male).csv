,,0,0,NO,"I went to Dr. Raju for my mother‚Äôs shoulder pain, I think Dr. Raju diagnosis was well but I was shocked when I asked for the breakdown of the charges of injections. The injection cost was just Rs. 200 but to inject it by Dr.Raju I was charged Rs.4,000 which was very high for me. I think patient should be well informed about the  break of the treatment and should give option to avail it or not avail it if it is over and above of the budget. Injections charge of Rs.4,000 in addition to constantly fees of Rs. 1,200 is too much for any middle class person like me.",2022-08-01 20:11:31,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
