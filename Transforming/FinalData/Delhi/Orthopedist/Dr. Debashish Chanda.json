I must appreciate his valuable guidance, treatment procedure and concerned nature in relation to his patients. It is indeed a great opportunity to avail his treatment. \n5 years back my mother had a knee replacement surgery of her right leg and now it is for the left one. I have witnessed a considerable upgradation in the treatment procedure which is what time demands. We have dealt with  a very cooperative team and they have adopted a very convenient procedure in regards to her treatment. 5 years back and now also the doctor and his entire team have taken extreme care to make our journey comfortable. We sincerely thank and express our gratitude for his benevolent service.\nThere are a good number of patients suffering from osteoarthritis problem today. I think they must have a consultation with Dr Debasish Chanda. \n",

And that was one of the best decisions of my life. By the God's grace and Dr. Debashish's efforts, the surgery went well. It's been 3months to my surgery, I am all okay now. I can walk properly without any struggle even I am able to drive and run. All thanks to Dr. Debashish.

He takes time with the patient explaining him intricate details and suggests surgeries only when it is required.\n\nFrom the moment we met, his professionalism and compassion put us at ease. He patiently explained the procedure and answered all our questions, alleviating any concerns we had. During the surgery, we felt complete trust knowing we were in the hands of such a capable and experienced surgeon.\n\nHis post-operative care was equally impressive. His attention to detail and willingness to listen to our concerns made my dad\u2019s recovery smoother than we could have imagined.\n\nIt has been over 10 days now and my dad has started walking and doing his own chores without any assistance. Though his legs pain but it will overcome in the coming days.\n\nThe only thing is that we have to be patient with the process and trust the doctor with his experience, professionalism and belief.\n\nI really want to thank him for going above and beyond to ensure the best possible outcome. His passion for his work and commitment to his patients are truly admirable. We are grateful to have been under your care and will always remember the positive impact you've had on my dad\u2019s life.",

I have witnessed a considerable upgradation in the treatment procedure which is what time demands. We have dealt with  a very cooperative team and they have adopted a very convenient procedure in regards to her treatment. 5 years back and now also the doctor and his entire team have taken extreme care to make our journey comfortable. We sincerely thank and express our gratitude for his benevolent service.\nThere are a good number of patients suffering from osteoarthritis problem today.

His skill and dedication truly made a difference in our lives.\n\nMy father had been suffering from osteoarthritis for quite a long time and we had almost given up after getting multiple temporary treatments. I met Dr. Debashish last year for the first time and he made us so comfortable in explaining the entire thing. He takes time with the patient explaining him intricate details and suggests surgeries only when it is required.\n\nFrom the moment we met, his professionalism and compassion put us at ease. He patiently explained the procedure and answered all our questions, alleviating any concerns we had. During the surgery, we felt complete trust knowing we were in the hands of such a capable and experienced surgeon.\n\nHis post-operative care was equally impressive. His attention to detail and willingness to listen to our concerns made my dad\u2019s recovery smoother than we could have imagined.\n\nIt has been over 10 days now and my dad has started walking and doing his own chores without any assistance. Though his legs pain but it will overcome in the coming days.\n\nThe only thing is that we have to be patient with the process and trust the doctor with his experience, professionalism and belief.\n\nI really want to thank him for going above and beyond to ensure the best possible outcome. His passion for his work and commitment to his patients are truly admirable. We are grateful to have been under your care and will always remember the positive impact you've had on my dad\u2019s life.",

I underwent ACL surgery with Dr. Debashish and received post-surgery care from his team, including physiotherapy by Nitesh Badhooni.\n\nDr. Debashish and his team were truly outstanding. From the initial consultation to the post-surgery care, they were professional, skilled, and attentive to my needs. They provided me with detailed information about the procedure, recovery process, and potential risks and complications. They made sure that I was well-informed and comfortable throughout the entire process.\n\nAfter the surgery, the physiotherapy sessions with Nitesh Badhooni were invaluable in my recovery. He was very ************* *** patient, and he tailored each session to my specific needs. He helped me regain my strength and flexibility, and I felt confident in his care.\n\nOverall, I am extremely satisfied with the care I received from Dr. Debashish and his team. They were exceptional in their medical expertise and patient care. I would highly recommend them to anyone in need of orthopedic care or ACL surgery.",

U R E K A !!!\nI found Joy of satisfaction for Galloping new sphere of life - Dr. Debashish Chanda ( Ortho-surgeon)\n\nI, Akhilesh Jain (M-65), had been suffering acute knee pain since 6-7 years and was in search of a qualified, competent and globally experienced Doctor for B/L joint replacement. I devoted my spare time on several platform like social media, print media, Google, internet world as well as my friends and local circle. Resultant I found Dr. Debashish Chanda.\nI took an appointment of Dr. Chanda at C.K. Birla Hospital Gurugram for 20-Feb-2021. As was my perception I found that he is well conversant and full of knowledge with TKR technology. He has very noble soul with human values and keeps very personal attention to diagnosis of the patient. My search was over then. Immediately with the consultation with my family I decided to get operation without any other second opinion etc. By grace of God I had gone under the successful operation without pain on dated 19-Apr-2021. Now I feel relaxed, comfortable with rays of new sphere of movement in life under the shadow of Dr. Debashish Chanda. His approach in the latest advance technology and his personal attention is strength of the patient. I pray to Goddess Maa-Durga for his sound health and prosperity as well as strongly recommend him for knee replacement/ treatment.",

I was recommended Dr. Debashish Chanda whom I found to be exceptionally good both in terms of diagnosis and treatment regime. I took Physiotherapy under the able guidance of Dr. Saed Varis and Dr. Nisha who designed specific program tailored to my needs with special focus on exercises. In just about two weeks I gained more than 80 % recovery and I am confident I will fully recover in the next few days. My special thanks to Dr. Debashish and his team. I have no hesitation to recommend Dr. Debashish and their Physiotherapy department for all Orthopaedic related complications.   ",

Earlier, one of the doctors had advised her to go straight for surgery but Dr Debashish explained us well about what stage she is at and while surgey can be beneficial, what other consequences can be, he also advised to try alternate medicinal treatment first. My Mom came back a very happy person and is now doing well with the treatment currently.",

You came for acl repair ages after your initial injury. In my detailed discussion I, had explained to you about all of the outcome due to delayed reconstruction. I don\u2019t think I, have taken any less time in explaining and convincing you about the surgery, if you want to call this Marketting I can\u2019t help. Thats a genuine good gesture from a doctor. My idea is to explain everything before any procedure, so that the patient should understand the problem and he/she should not be unnecessarily worried.\nYour surgery was completely successful and i do remember sending you the video of surgery from my phone as YOU forgot to collect it from OT before discharge. No hospital provides such surgical videos to the patient. we are the only hospital doing so, the only thing is you need to collect it in a pen drive ( as large size video). Many a times patient don\u2019t collect and hospital can\u2019t store it for long due to space crunch. We keep all details of end result of every patient so that we can remember what we did in the surgery. The same video i have given you through my phone & I clearly remember that.\nThe clicking noise your talking about is very common due to cartilage damage which is also very common after delayed acl surgery and it may stay or disappear with time. Again it is not because of the surgery we did, but depends on how meticulously and dedicatedly you follow the rehab regimen. \nAt 3 months of surgery i still remember that i was very happy with the recovery and told you about the new acl strength is exceptionally good.\nI don\u2019t remember in all 3 months i have ever tried to avoid your questions or queries. I have replied every if and buts you had.\nYou had some issues with your wife\u2019s treatment at the same hospital and the different doctor treating your wife. You tried to pull my name only to get discount and fee waver from hospital. ( what else a MNC company sales executive will do!!)\nAfter doing so much harm to my reputation without my fault, you had the audacity to come back to me. This time after a fight with your wife where you injured your operated knee. Truly saying, that day i was not at all interested in examining you, because of your wrong doing and mal aligning my honour. But as a doctor i cant refuse my duties even if we are treating enemies. \nAs far as i remember, it was the injury after 5 months which started causing problem to your knee. I don\u2019t take responsibility for that , and also someone like you who can say any bad word for others for personal gain. And thats why I, refused to treat you further. I still remember that I specifically told you to choose any doctor of your choice. As you have broken the doctor patient relationship and I don\u2019t regret it at all.\nI know only one thing those who do good for others get better in return. May God give you wisdom and peace.",

So please stop exaggerating.\nNow, regarding your first consultation- you came with ankle and forearm injury.. you forgot to mention the forearm injury in your review. And are you suggesting me how to examine an injured foot? Also, X-ray is an essential part of diagnosis, hence was advised. If your were unwilling, you were absolutely free to deny and walk out.\nRegarding the second consultation (after 4 wks of medication)- your forearm was completely normal on examination. Ankle gave you trouble on long walking which I told you was because of ligament weakness. I suggested Physiotherapy exercises for the same which would have helped strengthen it. The physiotherapist advised some home based exercises, the first session was given complimentary to you. You forgot to mention that too. The exercises are not shown at the hospital due to busy ongoing schedule of patients waiting. However, they are done with assistance at home by the physiotherapist. You had the liberty to visit any other doctor after the first visit itself if you were unhappy. \nPlease stop fake narrating on public platform, hiding and twisting actual facts just with an objective to defame doctor. Patients like you really demotivate doctors from doing their work. Lastly, it\u2019s not surprising to see such a review coming from you, someone who has only given bad reviews for every service taken and every place visited! God bless you and give you wisdom.",

Dr. your easy to understand - lay man communication with patient helps a lot to give a comfort and also creates strong bond with patient.  Nursing, Physio and house keeping team has been very proactive and thats why the post surgery treatment (3-4 days after operation ) - stay at hospital and needed recovery was possible. ",

I am very happy that you have given me the chance to explain the issue.\nYou came to me for your wife\u2019s consultation along with your child. I presume you brought your child as you had no other choice on a Saturday evening, which is fine. \nTo let you know, my Saturdays are always the busiest with scheduled morning surgeries and exhausting evening OPDs. The Saturday evening you visited was no better. When u visited me at 7pm, I was almost drained but I don\u2019t expect the patients to care about the doctor. While examining other patients scheduled before you, I had to try really hard to even listen to them because your kid was screaming outside. The moment you and your wife came inside your kid started howling and even conversation regarding the history of illness with your wife was difficult. And that's when I requested you to go outside with your child and pacify her. I\u2019m sure this makes sense. This made the consultation with the patient & explanation of illness a lot easier. I was sorry to have asked you to take your kid out for which I apologized to your wife. \nI am not in a hospitality business where I would cater to your whims ignoring my own job. For me, a good experience  is all about listening to patients and trying my best to help cure their problems. I hope you must be intelligent enough with a proper \u201cdegree\u201d to understand this and care about these little things on your next visit to doctor. Try to be a little less intolerant and more empathic. \nI wish you and your family well. \n\nRegards\nDr Debashish chanda",

Secondly, I had a detailed consultation with you regarding your condition, what is advised and what is not, and prescribed basic painkillers viz. Tab.  Dolo (paracetamol), tab. Zerodol MR and tab Pan 40 (cost of a weeks medication is around Rs. 200 combined). If u feel these are really expensive and heavy on your pocket, it\u2019s not the Doctor\u2019s fault!! Thirdly, I explained to you in details about the steroid injection in case the pain still persisted. Why on earth, u thought I was joking and how did u think it was \u201cUNACCEPTABLE\u201d I do not understand. It is a treatment modality!! And I am very well authorized, aware of when and how to administer it. You come and repeatedly ask for discount even in the consultation fees, do not want to spend on basic medicines, are not satisfied with such detailed explanation from the doctor. If these do not satisfy you, then what will!!!\nAnd please do not fabricate things, that u spent so much(even without actually spending it) just to amplify things and defame.",

And I remember every detail of your issue..\nFor last 4 years, you were suffering from back pain and for last 4 months you were not able to move properly with significant morning stiffness. Before consulting me, you had done 2months of physiotherapy but no improvement. You did all sorts of monkey exercises suggested by your acquaintances in front of me which i patiently observed knowing it was of no relevance. I dedicated my precious time and ear to your rubbish talks (apart from the significant history) and observed your antics. Whereas, diagnosis of ur problem should not take more than 2 mins with proper history taking and skilled examination which i believe i did. \nMy dear Mr.  Ravi, please get yourself checked for ankylosing spondylitis. I have adviced you tests which are very important for confirmation of diagnosis. \nEven the doctor you consulted before me suggested the same tests. Either you live in denial or get proper treatment. If you want to live in denial then plz don\u2019t waste any other doctor\u2019s time as our time is precious. I don\u2019t feel i have explained you any less. I deliberately didn\u2019t explain you about ankylosing spondylitis in details as I did not want to scare you until it was confirmed. \nThink about your duration of illness and problems. Both doctors suggested you the same tests. So I would suggest please get yourself treated on time.",

After a detailed history and clinical examination we arrive upon differential diagnosis of the problem. And to reinforce and come to a definite conclusion, various investigations are advised. In your case, I remember the consultation took around 1hr where I suggested possibility of cartilage (meniscus)damage, which is one of the commonest finding in your age group and also because of your heavy-weight. I just suggested u that loosing weight with exercises was not possible in ur case as u had a 3yrs old knee injury with 20-25 degrees of flexion deformity. I had also advised u an MRI for a better insight and evaluation of ur knee but unfortunately u never came back for review. And it\u2019s really saddening to know that you had no trust in your doctor and were so quick to judge and put allegations like that. \nU came to me with one of your relative who had shown me previously, and was satisfied, hence u came to my opd. Now you are suggesting others to avoid my consultation as i had adviced u to reduce weight which is one of the major causes of ur knee problem.\nI am neither insensitive nor a doctor who doesn\u2019t care for his patients. i usually never reply to comments but u have made me very upset.\nMy office tried contact you to inquire about you problem but u never responded to our calls.\nI am really apologetic if i hurt you in any way but i think u should keep ur feeling to u or discuss with the doctor before putting a review. I wish you a good health and hope for a better consultation with some other doctor.",

And sometimes even more difficult if patients comes with one joint pain and cause is a different joint.\nEvaluation is the thing which as a doctor I can do. I remember seeing you twice once i told you to get some xrays, and gave medications and physiotherapy to solve ur issue. \nUnfortunately there was no improvement. Which happens many a times and will lead to further evaluation. But being a patient i can just tell you this that sometimes you need to keep patience for treatment. \nI don\u2019t have any magic wand to heal everyone, its based on examination, evaluation and trial treatment we doctors treat patients. Hope you will understand. I also want your speedy recovery but not always we as doctor can deliver that. I would request please have patience for that, i can assure you that you will be better. I also keep thinking about patients who don\u2019t get improvement with treatment and will do my best to delivery better results. \nMy last request is please discuss your problem and concern when you come to visit doctor. Writing on practo platform may not help you as\u2026 I really don\u2019t know you will read it or not?\nSo if read it and you read my reply, plz visit again and will try to treat your problem if its not solved yet.!\n\nGood wishes \nDr debashish chanda",

Some patients may have complex conditions that require more time and attention, while others may have simple issues that can be addressed quickly. Additionally, unexpected emergencies or delays can arise, causing appointments to run longer than expected. It is therefore crucial to understand that one needs to be flexible and patient when scheduling appointments with a doctor. I was only busy seeing patients without a break. \nRegarding your consultation - I spent around 20\nminutes with you, took a detailed medical history, examined you, explained to you in details about \u201cnecessary\u201d medications and physiotherapy exercises that u would have required. If you feel it was quick, it\u2019s your problem not mine. \nI agree that I skipped on writing investigations like X- rays or MRI because I felt it was unnecessary with your history of 2 wks back pain due to travel and exertion. \nI would suggest you to at least follow the advice of the doctor and see if the condition improves before jumping into writing a review. Aren\u2019t you also being a \u201cquick analyst\u201d now?",

(You Should have gone to emergency directly but many patients come to save the emergency charges). I have seen you in my opd even after that and adviced you to get a pain injection and and xray. I remember I specifically adviced you to stay in emergency and i will come to see you there with your xrays. (Without any emergency charges) \nBut you seemed to be in too hurry and came back again to opd for which my coordinator explained to go back to emergency. Now if you don\u2019t follow the instructions and want to jumble between opd and emergency to skip lines, thats not right. Patient word its self has come from patience, you should have patience.\nI have explained about the need of plaster for which you have refused which i have explained is your wish. I have spent full required time with you to full fil your queries. Now treatment can\u2019t be according to your choice.\nMy request is if your problem is so small then you should visit some clinic nearby, where you can save time.",
