Every doctor I had seen had told me that my condition, Avascular Necrosis of the Foot, was incurable and that I would have to learn to live with the pain for the rest of my life.\n\nBut he refused to give up on me. He took on my case with unwavering dedication and expertise, and performed a rare and complex foot surgery that no other doctor was willing to attempt. I think this is the one of the first surgery in the country.\n\nWhat struck me most was his exceptional communication skills - he explained every detail in a simple, easy-to-understand way, making sure I was comfortable and informed throughout the process. He even called me personally to check on my condition, over the phone. His smile is so amazing and you will forget all your pain just by seeing his smile and kind nature.\n\nThanks to his tireless efforts and innovative approach, I am now pain-free after suffering for over two years. His compassion, kindness, and commitment to his patients are unparalleled. The entire staff at Sparsh Orthopedic, from the nurses to the other doctors, were supportive and kind, making my journey so much easier.\n\nDr. Ankit is more than just a doctor - he is a true healer. He saw beyond my diagnosis and saw me, a person in need of hope and healing. He took responsibility for my care when others wouldn't, and his expertise and skill have given me a second chance at life.\n\nIf you're struggling with a condition that seems impossible to treat, don't give up. Dr. Ankit and the team at Sparsh Orthopedic are a shining example of the power of medical excellence and compassion. I will be forever grateful for their care and recommend them to anyone seeking a doctor who truly cares.\n\nThank you again sir.",

I visited Dr Ankit with acute neck pain problem. Upon xray review Dr mentioned that I have some enlarged bone in neck C5 section. Since birth this happens and that this prob will keep troubling me whenever strain is put on neck. I asked if its cervical spondolytis but he denied. Already surprised at his logic of enlarged bone, I requested for guidance on further treatment. Inspite of my request to not give strong painkillers Dr gave me tab which used to make me drowsy through the day. After 3 days and no improvement I decided to consult another Dr through Practo who finally  diagnosed me with early signs of Acute Cervical pain and immediately advised me rest and other treatment. In two days I could feel the improvement through second opinion.

Probably if we visit larger hospitals, we get intimidated with the services, facilities and swanky structures, however at his hospital( Sparsh orthopaedic ) , facilities in terms of uniforms , high light corrridors , large reception ,inquiry counters , cafeteria etc are basic however you come back with a satisfied feeling. *** **** *** ******* ***** **** you pay for the doctor\u2019s intention and motivation to work rather than shelling out large amount for hospital\u2019s structural developments  and largely you dont go through several tests to know what the issue could be as he is well aware once you explain him in details. x ray and scans are suggested only when the issue is big in large context.\n\nI and my husgand have a lot respect for Dr Bhartia due to his due diligence and human friendly approach. Probably he could be the most famous doctor if he would chosen to work in the large glass and concrete hospitals, however I feel he has chosen to stay blessed.\nRegards\nKanika and Nikhil",

Following which He was never able to put weight on his operated leg and was bed ridden since 4 yrs. Doctor who operated were never ready to accept that something is wrong with operated Hip. Time passed and gradually pain increased to such an extent that even minor movement in bed was extremely painful. We consulted numerous Doctors but without any satisfactory solution.\nThen my relative who got knee replacement done by Dr. Ankit  informed us about him. We met Dr. Ankit and asked him to just relieve the pain of my father so that whole family can atleast sleep peacefully. He explained to us meticulously about the problem and the treatment. We were immediately convinced to get the procedure done as advised by Dr. Ankit. We never thought if dad would be able to walk again, and at 2 weeks time my Dad was on his feet walking with the help of walker. It was like a miracle for us. Dr. Ankit not just relieved pain of my father but also made him capable of doing his daily personal task.\nVery rarely do we meet such Genuine Doctors with such command and in-depth knowledge in the Subject. I wont forget to mention his time management skills, he is always busy still always on time. \nI will be highly indebted to him for ending my fathers pain and agony.\nMay God Bless Dr. Ankit.\n",

Yes sling is optional.\nYou asked if you can drive with very minimal gear changes - I said yes you can- even this doesn\u2019t change. \nOnly thing required was a little patience for 3 weeks and you could have saved the time for 2nd visit and also a 3rd visit for 2 more X-rays which was not required if things were so clear in 1st x-ray it-self. \nThanks \nIn Pursuit of Excellence\nTeam Sparsh",

Every doctor I had seen had told me that my condition, Avascular Necrosis of the Foot, was incurable and that I would have to learn to live with the pain for the rest of my life.\n\nBut he refused to give up on me. He took on my case with unwavering dedication and expertise, and performed a rare and complex foot surgery that no other doctor was willing to attempt. I think this is the one of the first surgery in the country.\n\nWhat struck me most was his exceptional communication skills - he explained every detail in a simple, easy-to-understand way, making sure I was comfortable and informed throughout the process. He even called me personally to check on my condition, over the phone. His smile is so amazing and you will forget all your pain just by seeing his smile and kind nature.\n\nThanks to his tireless efforts and innovative approach, I am now pain-free after suffering for over two years. His compassion, kindness, and commitment to his patients are unparalleled. The entire staff at Sparsh Orthopedic, from the nurses to the other doctors, were supportive and kind, making my journey so much easier.\n\nDr. Ankit is more than just a doctor - he is a true healer. He saw beyond my diagnosis and saw me, a person in need of hope and healing. He took responsibility for my care when others wouldn't, and his expertise and skill have given me a second chance at life.\n\nIf you're struggling with a condition that seems impossible to treat, don't give up. Dr. Ankit and the team at Sparsh Orthopedic are a shining example of the power of medical excellence and compassion. I will be forever grateful for their care and recommend them to anyone seeking a doctor who truly cares.\n\nThank you again sir.",

I visited Dr Ankit with acute neck pain problem. Upon xray review Dr mentioned that I have some enlarged bone in neck C5 section. Since birth this happens and that this prob will keep troubling me whenever strain is put on neck. I asked if its cervical spondolytis but he denied. Already surprised at his logic of enlarged bone, I requested for guidance on further treatment. Inspite of my request to not give strong painkillers Dr gave me tab which used to make me drowsy through the day. After 3 days and no improvement I decided to consult another Dr through Practo who finally  diagnosed me with early signs of Acute Cervical pain and immediately advised me rest and other treatment. In two days I could feel the improvement through second opinion. I am not convinced with Dr Ankit ** ** ***** *** ******** ** **** ************* **** ** ******** ********* *** ********* ***** ** * *** ** ***** ** *********** ** *** ********* *** ********** *******",

Probably he could be the most famous doctor if he would chosen to work in the large glass and concrete hospitals, however I feel he has chosen to stay blessed.\nRegards\nKanika and Nikhil",

Following which He was never able to put weight on his operated leg and was bed ridden since 4 yrs. Doctor who operated were never ready to accept that something is wrong with operated Hip. Time passed and gradually pain increased to such an extent that even minor movement in bed was extremely painful. We consulted numerous Doctors but without any satisfactory solution.\nThen my relative who got knee replacement done by Dr. Ankit  informed us about him. We met Dr. Ankit and asked him to just relieve the pain of my father so that whole family can atleast sleep peacefully. He explained to us meticulously about the problem and the treatment. We were immediately convinced to get the procedure done as advised by Dr. Ankit. We never thought if dad would be able to walk again, and at 2 weeks time my Dad was on his feet walking with the help of walker. It was like a miracle for us. Dr. Ankit not just relieved pain of my father but also made him capable of doing his daily personal task.\nVery rarely do we meet such Genuine Doctors with such command and in-depth knowledge in the Subject. I wont forget to mention his time management skills, he is always busy still always on time. \nI will be highly indebted to him for ending my fathers pain and agony.\nMay God Bless Dr. Ankit.\n",

Yes sling is optional.\nYou asked if you can drive with very minimal gear changes - I said yes you can- even this doesn\u2019t change. \nOnly thing required was a little patience for 3 weeks and you could have saved the time for 2nd visit and also a 3rd visit for 2 more X-rays which was not required if things were so clear in 1st x-ray it-self. \nThanks \nIn Pursuit of Excellence\nTeam Sparsh",

I was not sure of this place until I met doctor Ankit. He is an amazing doctor who gives a good amount of time to his patients and listens to all their concern plus he knows how to treat them well. It all created a very positive effect on me and my mother as it was clearly visible he is very loyal towards his work. I will highly recommend people to visit him for related issues. We are surely going to visit him again for any of ortho related concerns. Thanks :)",

Then I came to know about Dr. Ankit and that he does a new procedure called A-C Joint tight rope for this. I researched any it in all possible was and finally decided to undergo surgery by Dr. Ankit. It's 10 months now and my left shoulder is absolutely normal like the right without any weakness. I do gym and weight lifting without any problem. All thanks to Dr. Ankit for saving me from the agony of partial recovery. Thanks for making my shoulder 100% fit, as he always says, We do not want 99%, we want 100%. Would recommend him to all my family and friends who want a genuine and updated information about their problems.",

I had shown it to many doctors in Gurgaon but i was never given the correct treatment and no doctor ever had keen intrest in understanding where the problem was coming from. Dr.Ankit always listens to the problems patiently and advises most genuinely about the relationship of daily excercises with improvement. He has encouraged me to not only rely on medicines but do the excercises which made my problem decrease alot. Thankyou for your advises and great treatment Sir! We need more people like you around us. \n",

Wisdom to stick to a Doctor. Courage to go to a government hosp if money is a concern and courage to speak the truth as ur med bill was 1100/- for 2 weeks. \nFor blood tests just thank God that I got only minimal test done worth Rs. 600/-.\nI could have easily called u in 5 days time n med cost would have been 400/- but it would have led to wastage to your energy, time and money and u would go out with same med. So to save your time n money I called u in 2 weeks time as I know wrist pains are troublesome sometimes and can take time to heal.\nIt requires intelligence to think this way. And we seriously think before u start treatment just trust your Doctor and do not ruin things from your end itself. \nHappy window shopping. \nThanks \nIn Pursuit of Excellence\nTeam Sparsh",

Dr. Ankit after examining your ankle and seeing the X-Ray validated that there is no fracture and there is only ligament injury and treated you for same. You came to Sparsh to consult the super-specialist  in the field who is Dr. Ankit so it makes no sense pondering over the diagnosis given by juniors. \nWe strongly advise patient to take home only Wat is relevant and not ponder over irrelevants. You were called in a weeks time for re-assessment n start rehab, re-assessment does not mean re X-Ray. One also needs to understand correctly Wat is being conveyed.\nThis also would justify that everyone injured should get treated at Sparsh as patients will never be misguided what ever be the diagnosis given by other doctors or even our junior Doctors. \nThe diagnosis and treatment will be unbiased, spot on and leading to quick recovery. \nThanks \nIn Pursuit of Excellence \nTeam Sparsh",

Secondly the medicines are available at the inhouse pharmacy only and the pharmacist changes the medicine if not available without even informing the patient. This happened me with on 2 occassions\n\n2) you dont have to pay for doctor's visiting charges if you visit within 2 days but who has to go for a follo up meeting within 2 days. The minimum duration for which a doctor prescribes medicine is for 5 days, so that 2 days window is just to show that they have such a clause.

You were wasting my time and the time of numerous other patient who were waiting outside. You should have been with the patient during the consultation.

Have you ever seen a doctor calling up and telling you the report. Yes we do this. Did you appreciate this. No. \nThen I enquired how is your pain and you said it\u2019s perfectly fine now. This means the diagnosis and treatment was spot on. \nDid you thank me for this. No. \nDid you even read the msg of appointment. It states that appointment comes with a wait time of 30 minutes. Your appointment was scheduled for 12:20, consultation started on 12:40 and you were out of my cabin exactly at 12:53. \nThis time keeping also requires intelligence, we do not expect this precise time keeping from you, still this was just for your knowledge that we were on time. \nWe serve with a smile but with smile we do not loose seriousness and professionalism. \nWe take each and every ones problem seriously, how so ever small it may seem, we never take it lightly. And on top of it we do not leave your hand till your recovery is complete. We call up operated patients to enquire about their well being. Ever seen any one do this. Despite being very busy we do it everyday. \nThere are 2 kind of person we never want to treat\n1. Thankless people.\n2. People without sympathy and empathy. (Your tone for the reception staff- hum jaise professional log ko wo samjha rahe hai)\nWe regret having treated you. \nAll the best with Thanks and Empathy\n\nIn pursuit of excellence \nTeam Sparsh.",

Well we really insist on taking medicines from in-house pharmacy and the whole purpose of this is to decrease your hassle of roaming from pharmacy to pharmacy and getting irritated. Then calling us and asking to make the pharmacist understand the medicines. Pharmacist will not have the same medicine then asking to give a supplement. Just imagine how much time and energy is wasted in all this. Just imagine the chaos for us after seeing more than 50 patients daily and 50% patients calling up for medicines alone. All wants branded medicines we give branded only. All wants discount on medicine we give that also. After all this I could never understand why one wants to roam around with the prescription which has the tried and tested medicines to suit you best with least side effects and ending up with over the counter medicines.  \n\nThanks \nIn pursuit of excellence\nTeam Sparsh",

It\u2019s a doctors appointment and waiting time can increase significantly on occasional days. Any walk in patient coming to hospital doesn\u2019t come to enjoy a pizza. They are also in pain and they need to be  respected too. \n5:30 to 6:15 all appointments came in late and all arrived around 6:15. Just imagine the amount of time wasted and chaos created. And also think about who created it. Also if you can think about the solution to this I would love to have it. Should we send them back, or give a negative recommendation to patients coming late. \nWe did not make you wait doing something not meant to be done during OPD hours. We did not make you wait sipping a coffee and chatting with friends. We were working at highest level of professionalism taking care of every one the perfect timers, the walkins and the late comers and yes without compromising on the time and quality of consultation. \nI guess you forgot to mention about your experience with the doctor, the quality of consultation, advice and medication given? \nOr maybe the stresses of delay was so much that all the positives were forgotten.\nWhere-in every one waited with patience. \nAll that was needed was a little patience.\nAfter getting your tennis elbow fixed will surely have a game of tennis someday. \nIn Pursuit of Excellence\nTeam Sparsh",
