Then much much later, recently I contacted one of my school friend Dr. Arindam Mukherjee and he recommended Dr. D.K.

Tried to see 2 times after the first time but never got to see him anywhere near the promised time. Got a call 2+ hours after the promised time to come see him both times. It's as if only his time is valuable and we are just at his mercy in this whole wide world. Secondly, he doesn't honour the appointments booked through Practo which contributes to the problem of a high wait time. Lastly, I found him to be an arrogant, but that's a subjective matter and others might feel differently. Also, I cannot comment on the treatment provided as I haven't been able to consult with him after the first time. Need to have 1 follow up consultation atleast to review. But I highly doubt I will do that.",

Tried to see 2 times after the first time but never got to see him anywhere near the promised time. Got a call 2+ hours after the promised time to come see him both times. It's as if only his time is valuable and we are just at his mercy in this whole wide world. Secondly, he doesn't honour the appointments booked through Practo which contributes to the problem of a high wait time. Lastly, I found him to be an arrogant, but that's a subjective matter and others might feel differently. Also, I cannot comment on the treatment provided as I haven't been able to consult with him after the first time. Need to have 1 follow up consultation atleast to review. But I highly doubt I will do that.",
