He examined the joint in detail and took one for knowing the current status. He explained everything about what has gone wrong , discused about the available options. On the basis of my experienc with Dr. Raju Vaishya I can say that Doctor is very patient caring. he is a very great Listener & suggests solutions. For me he is the true God in human form. A well maintained hygenic environment throughout. His fees also were very nominal rather below the standard fees charged by others. He explains the root cause of the problem and the pros & cons of the curative & preventive measures.The doctor explained the problem appropriately and suggested necessary exercises to fasten the healing of the joint. \nMy heartfelt thanks to him for all his guidance and support. I would definitely recommend him for any orthopaedic problem. my experience with Staffs of Dr. Raju Vaishya was satisfying. ",

I think patient should be well informed about the  break of the treatment and should give option to avail it or not avail it if it is over and above of the budget. Injections charge of Rs.4,000 in addition to constantly fees of Rs. 1,200 is too much for any middle class person like me.",

A well maintained hygenic environment throughout. His fees also were very nominal rather below the standard fees charged by others. He explains the root cause of the problem and the pros & cons of the curative & preventive measures.The doctor explained the problem appropriately and suggested necessary exercises to fasten the healing of the joint. \nMy heartfelt thanks to him for all his guidance and support.

I think patient should be well informed about the  break of the treatment and should give option to avail it or not avail it if it is over and above of the budget. Injections charge of Rs.4,000 in addition to constantly fees of Rs. 1,200 is too much for any middle class person like me.",
