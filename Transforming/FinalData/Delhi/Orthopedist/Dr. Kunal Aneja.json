During my first consultation with the doctor, he explained what might be the issue behind twisting of knee even with a slight disbalance and asked me to go for an MRI. The reports confirm that the ACL was completely torn, and Dr. Kunal did an ACL reconstruction surgery at Max Hospital in Shalimar Bagh. I am writing this review almost nine months after the surgery, and I am fully recovered and more confident than before. The doctor from the first consultation until now has been very approachable and has answered and explained all my queries in detail.I will definitely recommend Dr. Kunal Aneja to anyone who wants to go for any surgery or ortho related issue.",

He helped in my case by diagnosing for scoliosis because of which there was sciatica and femoral nerve pain in my leg which couldnt let me sleep whole night. Under Dr.kunal i was referred to physio Dr.Nisar who right from day one worked so professionally well and helped me get rid of my pain that lasted for more than a month. Dr.Nisar helped me get back to normal and sleep well too by giving me the right and best line of treatment from day one by day four i was 80 percent well. I wasted one month on some unprofessional clinic but Dr.Nisar just got me well in few days. Thanks to both the doctors i am happy to be treated well under unconditionally helpful team of these doctors. Thanku",

The reports confirm that the ACL was completely torn, and Dr. Kunal did an ACL reconstruction surgery at Max Hospital in Shalimar Bagh. I am writing this review almost nine months after the surgery, and I am fully recovered and more confident than before. The doctor from the first consultation until now has been very approachable and has answered and explained all my queries in detail.I will definitely recommend Dr. Kunal Aneja to anyone who wants to go for any surgery or ortho related issue.",

Dr.Nisar helped me get back to normal and sleep well too by giving me the right and best line of treatment from day one by day four i was 80 percent well. I wasted one month on some unprofessional clinic but Dr.Nisar just got me well in few days.
