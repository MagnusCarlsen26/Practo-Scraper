Number of Doctors were consulted and they all were prescribing some pain killers and calcium supplements which always provided a temporary relief. Finally, I consulted Dr.  Mahajan at BLK Max and it was by Chance( I had no prior information about him before that). . Based on Radiology  tests,  he suggested for Arthroscopic surgery. The surgery was sucessfully conducted  in December, 2021. From last 14 months,  my mother is feeling fine and can sleep both ways.  The pain is no more there.  The best thing about Dr.  Rakesh Mahajan and his team is that they explain each and every aspect of the problem, explain the radiology reports etc.  These things help the  patient to take right decision at right time and in right manner.

One of my relatives recommended me Dr Mahajan, so I didn't do any due diligence on my part (given he's associated with a very renowned hospital in Delhi). \n\nPost my surgery I did required physiotherapy as suggested by the doctor and was of view that my ligament problem has been sorted, but barley I knew this was not the case.\n\nI played cricket almost after 1.5 years of my surgery for the first time (I work in corporate, so don't play sports that often). I fell on the ground and  felt a jerk in the same way as I used to before my ACL surgery. I got my MRI done again and it came out that my reconstructed ACL has been broken.\n\nKey takeaways: \nAfter my surgery I never got the confidence in my operated knee, I was skeptical of my ability to play sports again, even though I was able to walk and do jogging but this was not the sole purpose of undergoing ACL surgery.\n\nDr just recommended me normal physiotherapy (later I got to know from youtube that patients also join rehab centres for proper ACL  exercises which I didn't do). But I was too late for this. *** *** **** ** **** ** *** ****** **** ** ******** ***** ****** ***** *** *** ****** **** ****** ** ***** *** **********\nNow I'll be going for a second ACL surgery which has lessor chances of success than my first surgery, so if you are getting this done for the first time then it's really pivotal to choose your surgeon wisely. Please do thorough research on the doctor. There is lot of info in public domain now days.\n\nI won't recommend him *** *** ******* ** * ********* ******* **** **** *** *** **** ****** *** *** **** **** ** ******* *** *** ******* ***** *** ************** **** **** **** * ****** *** *** ******* ******* ***** ** ******* *** ********* *** *************\n\n",

When he was operated he was told that he will be able to run after 6 months. He did proper physiotherapy sessions, checked with doctor after 6 months that he can start jogging. The next day as soon as he just took his steps for jogging, he fell. He had similar pain, we immediately went to doctor to which he said  ACL broke again. Doctor said it is because he didn't take care properly which was not the case , we took all precautions which were suggested by him. We thought that might be the case as for us Doctor is GOD. We had to go for another surgery and this time he took hamstring tendon from his right leg but he didn't inform us prior to the operation. He asked my brother in operation theatre and what can he say that time apart from yes, thinking doctor might be right.\nThis time we we're little bit confused on why he did that without informing family but there was something wrong going on.After few days of operation my brother felt something in the knee and was not able to walk. We got an MRI done and found there is a screw in the knee. On consulting another doctor we found the first operation itself was wrong. The alignment of ligament was a bit above than it should be. We consulted so many doctors and nobody has seen such case before and nobody was confident on how that can be corrected. Finally we found a very good doctor who operated him and he is able to walk. He is still doing physiotherapy sessions. My utter request to everyone is please don't go to this doctor for any ligament surgery, *** ***** *** *** ** *** ***** My brother had to go in so much pain both mental and physical.His same knee is operated 4 times,**** ****** ** *** * ****** *** **** ** *** ********** Also one small request to everyone,this doctor was our family doctor so we trusted him, but if any of you have some problem please consult other doctors and the come to a decision.",
