Last year I got reference of Dr Garg . He assured my Grandmother and the rest of the family that going for a decompression surgery will improve the quality of life of my grandmother. His empathetic counselling and understanding of nuance convinced us that he is the one. My grandmother got operated and is pain free now. Dr Garg  is commendable as a spine surgeon but is an even great human who supports the patient through out the process of recovery! Highly recommended!",

We have consulted many places  where we are suggested to go for replacement . My mother is not willing for any surgery after that I consulted this doctor .\nFirst of all he is the only doctor who didn\u2019t say replacement of knees . Dr garg explained my mother everything about the osteoarthritis  and asked her to do exercises and to avoid some posture which is worsening all these things . Sir advised some medication and asked us to go for injection in knees callled as viscosuplement which Is not a steroid , we agreed to his advice , now 2 months has been gone and my mother is feeling much relieved from pain  which we didn\u2019t expect .\nSo I thank dr garg as we are not expecting this result .\nThanks a lot sir",

Dr Garg is very friendly and caring, explained everything in details and give us time to take decision.\nHighly recommended.",

I have also re-consulted Dr. Garg multiple times since then. Always a good experience since he is able to give step by step guidance on the procedure, healing process, etc. Highly recommended. ",

Within 10mins of reaching there i was attended by the doctor who after examining me for 10-15mins started my treatment that included spinal physiotherapy. Now after 10 days of physiotherapy by Dr Preeti Singh under the guidance of Dr Garg my back pain is relieved to such extent that i dont even need to take any painkillers. Its not just the hospitality of the staff but also the commitment the doctor shows to get his patient healthy that is worth appreciating. Thank you Dr Garg and Dr Preeti.",

I got the X ray done at their clinic only and showed the reports. For the other test (Dexa Scan), I had to get it done from outside. When I sent the reports to the clinic and asked them to connect me with the doctor on phone for a couple of minutes to discuss the report, they refused and told me that I will have to take physical appointment again and pay the consultation fee to discuss the report.

Dr lalit garg told us that there is no need for surgery and we can manage it very better in plaster cast . We are convinced for that and we undergone plaster cast .\nWe removed that cast in 25 days and undergo therapy for mobilisation for 15 days . Now it\u2019s has been 40 days from the date of injury and my mother wrist is absolutely fine .\nSo I suggest everybody to take second opinion before undergoing surgery as you can find very good doctors also .\n",

Prior to the treatment  as patient\u2019s family member was in great anxiety and came from south ex all the way to vasant kunj. It being Sunday evening with maximum clinics closed the doctor kindly agreed to take the patient on hearing their problem regarding the 2 yr child. Doctor agreed to do treatment and asked them to come to clinic.  X ray was done to confirm the diagnosis. The doctor quickly reduced the elbow to the best of his expertise resulting in the  child becoming painless, happy and able to move elbow comfortably. On being totally satisfied with treatment instead of being thankful for the effort put in by the doctor mother started  showing  tantrum as child is fine now and according to her doctor has done nothing .It is very sad and pitiful to see such kind of response after getting satisfactory treatment. It weakens the resolve of a doctor to keep his holiday aside and treat a patient in emergency.",

At clinic once we are in pain and doctor is giving us treatment we are only dependent upon him. Once he's done with all the stuff time to ask for payment. At that time we (patient) want doctor to be honest. But in Dr Lalit's case they charged really high fees from me. And we have to pay becuz to a doctor no one can deny. They have taken 4500 for a POP plaster that is also single sided (if y think its nt costly then that's ur thinking, but fr me that do not worth more than 1500) Xray is of 900 . I don't think bill is worth and if can show u the situation of plaster just after 6 days,",
