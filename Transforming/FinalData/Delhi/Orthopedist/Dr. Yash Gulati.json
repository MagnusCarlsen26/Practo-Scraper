I am back in Houston, Texas, enjoying pain free time with my family. As I continue to heal, I wanted your opinion on the type of sutures and the style used so that I can return to my doctor to have them removed. As mentioned, incision site has  healed and has intermittent itching on both ends due to the sutures. A brief explanation will help with the best approach for the removal. \nMy family and I wish you a nice weekend.\n\nYours faithfully\nEphantus Mbuthia.",

The hip was ankylosed associated with unilateral pelvic tilt and medial rotation of the limb. \nMy leg was lengthened  by10cm, the 3cm remaining was due to pelvic tilt. He reassured me that with time the tilted pelvis will come down. As i type now iam 12days post op and the shortening is 2.6cm. Iam greatful for the great care and treatment I received from. Doctor Gulati it is my prayer to the Lord that he may give Him more wisdom to save many lives! \nThankyou Dr for the great work once again\ud83d\ude0d\n\n#Blessings",

I am back in Houston, Texas, enjoying pain free time with my family. As I continue to heal, I wanted your opinion on the type of sutures and the style used so that I can return to my doctor to have them removed. As mentioned, incision site has  healed and has intermittent itching on both ends due to the sutures. A brief explanation will help with the best approach for the removal. \nMy family and I wish you a nice weekend.\n\nYours faithfully\nEphantus Mbuthia.",

The hip was ankylosed associated with unilateral pelvic tilt and medial rotation of the limb. \nMy leg was lengthened  by10cm, the 3cm remaining was due to pelvic tilt. He reassured me that with time the tilted pelvis will come down. As i type now iam 12days post op and the shortening is 2.6cm. Iam greatful for the great care and treatment I received from.
