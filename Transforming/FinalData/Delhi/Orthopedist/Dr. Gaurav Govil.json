When a patient goes to visit a doctor first thing the most important for a patient is that the doctor listens to his or her patient calmly n fully... Which I experienced with him. He is so humble n polite, he makes you comfortable n makes you understand the problem and the solution of the problem. A positive nature of Dr Gaurav gives you positive vibes which heals the patient for 30\u2105 there n then. Thank you doctor",
