,,0,0,YES,"I’ll keep this simple and honest.I cannot speak highly enough of Dr Raju Easwaran.Before him I had consulted around 3-4 top Orthopedic surgeons in Delhi but i can tell that his style of practice is totally different from the other doctors of his league.Rather than rushing for surgery or unnecessary invasive procedures he tries the patient condition to improve organically through correct diagnosis and treatment protocols with minimal usage of medications.It’s rare to find a doctor of such a repute and rich experience who genuinely cares for his patients unlike those misguiding gullible patients of their hard earned money.He makes me feel so safe that I’m in good hands. His professionalism and empathy truly make him stand out in his field. If you need a great top notch doctor to help you with your health and wellness do yourself a favor and meet this man.
