All the charges  are displayed in reception and these are the routine charges all across dwarka.

Normally all those patients who ask about charges are told the charges. 

Still after this experience I would ensure that the patient should pay the the charges before hand so that there is no comfusion.

You already mentioned that u were given a discount- u paid total of 3000- (700 consultation plus 600 xray and 1700 for plaster- so in plaster charges u were given a discount of  approx 60 percent) as I told u to give watever you want.

I beg to differ regarding the rushing of things.  

I clearly remember that we had a discussion about treatment. Even surgery was an option if u want to avoid any deformity in hand but as we discussed functionally plaster would suffice. And as plaster is sufficient we planned for plaster management.

All your questions were answered.

Dos and donts are mentioned in your prescription if you see.

Also I try to answer all questions of the patients.

In my prescription I have given my watsapp number which i reply usually the same day.

Regarding pain , its just 10 days , fracture healing takes time and you were asked to do follow up after 5 days  which you did not.

I am still open for any discussion regarding management.
