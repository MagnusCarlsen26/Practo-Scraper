My mother was in severe pain for last 5 years and she was not able to walk without any support. Her legs were also starting to deform. Dr Kharbanda and his team did such a fine job that my mother feels she got a new life. Surgery was totally painless and so was the recovery. My mother was able to return to normal life after a month and now she goes on 2 mile morning walks. Highly recommend Dr Kharbanda for knee replacement. **** **** *********** ******* ** ***** ****",
