You had booked an appointment via Practo for a video consultation. And we had tried to connect to you four times via the app before even your first attempt and we have screen shots for the same.  If you have had previous Practo virtual consultations, you would be aware and you should understand, that the call not getting connected may not mean that somebody is disconnecting the calls, it may be a technical issue! If it is a technical issue with PRACTO, please contact the right channel to sort it out. PRACTO does not allow doctors to share personal WhatsApp number for completing the appointments.  But seeing the issue with the app, we still shared the clinic WhatsApp number to complete the consultation. And to put the facts straight, the call that you received to accommodate via WhatsApp was our initiative to serve you better. No communication received from Practo. Further, we have never faced any issue with our previous consultation on the platform. But even if you face an issue with a product, there are platforms to raise it, but here the same was never done.
Secondly, dear Mr Khan, appointments are fixed till 11 pm and there were other in person appointments waiting after you. It is unwise that after spending 15 minutes to sort out the technical issue with the app, we delay other patients waiting after you. But still we paused appointments in between and were able to accommodate you at 8.15 pm. But you are posting false facts that the video call on app was disconnected.
Thirdly, and to the doctor’s surprise, when we connected with you, you had already made your diagnosis, plan of treatment and prognosis for your disease yourself. When it was insisted that we discuss your symptoms, you were clear that you know your diagnosis and treatment and just need pain killers. This is apparent from your post here. You, yourself, state that you “know” that the pain would subside in a week. We would have been more than happy to treat your disease as a whole, but you were not willing to have that discussion. We had tried to ask you umpteen number of times about your symptoms but there was no response. The doctor can start treatment if he is presented with symptoms, which unfortunately in this case were never presented. 
Fourthly, any medication for pain relief is not meant to give you relief of pain instantly. But rather than waiting for the period the medication has been prescribed for, your eagerness to post immediately after a single dose, shows something amiss. Your first feedback for Dr Vipul Vijay came within 10 hours of taking the first dose of your medicine and on a separate platform. And after you had posted your feedback, you were asking follow up queries on the app, which were promptly replied to.  These point to something amiss in this consultation from your end.
Another limitation on the online consultation platforms is that we are allowed to prescribe only NSAIDs, no higher analgesics can be prescribed, until it is an in person consultation and after clinical examination. But in your hurry to post, within less than 10 hours of taking the medication, we are sure you would have missed that fact. Anyways, the platform via WhatsApp and Practo were both open, but your eagerness to post shows that you’re not interested in having relief of treatment, just need vindication for your “self diagnosis”.
We do not believe in providing the highest pain killer at the first instance as we care for our patients and do not follow such irresponsible behavior, how much so the other party may force us to. You had already been prescribed the analgesics for your disease, had it been a communication through a proper channel, the restrictions in prescription of higher pain killers would have been clearly explained to you in detail (the same has already been communicated to you via the chat in the app). The practice guidelines for virtual consultation is an open document and clearly delineate the medications which can or cannot be prescribed via a virtual consult. 
You had been clearly advised to see a “clinician in person” if the pain does not subside. You were never advised to visit a new one, but “in person”, but in your haste to post you must have missed that part.
This reply is to put all your facts in perspective. But would recommend to see the doctor with an open mind and in person so that your pain can be managed and further treatment initiated. We are still happy to serve you and wish you a speedy recovery.

I am extremely pained to hear about your mother’s allergic reaction. But as would understand, that allergic reaction to any medicine is extremely difficult to predict. Until, of course, if you keep a track of all the medications that cause allergy to a person. Unfortunately, we did not have any of such records at hand in your mother’s case. 
I am happy to hear that she had recovered from the medical condition she was being treated for. As far as I see from our records available with us, she had reported excellent relief of symptoms.
She was also advised to start physiotherapy to which she showed her inability to start, and hence pain relief had to be maintained on multi-vitamins which may have caused her allergy but allergic reactions to any allergen, be that pollen, dust fomites, even air pollutants can not be predicted. 
I do wish her speedy recovery and sincerely advise you to keep a track of the medicines causing allergic reactions to the patient, so that you are able to get her allergy related issues managed better in the future.
I wish her good health and speedy recovery.

Thanks for your feedback. This is a dilemma which we are faced with everyday. 
We believe that when a patient has sought a medical opinion, the symptoms warrant further investigations. The test are needed for diagnosing your issue and managing them better. We sincerely do not believe in ordering one investigation at a time and calling you again and again for follow ups. We start the treatment once we are sure about your diagnosis and further plan. 
Unfortunately, in our societal scenario, patients are disappointed if the investigations turn out to be negative!! 
Also we neither have any blood collection facilities and nor MRI facilities at our facility and encourage patients to get their tests done at the place of their choice. 
We sincerely wish you have relief from your symptoms with no investigations and your condition is diagnosed and treated without any investigations.
Wish you a speedy recovery.",2021-07-17T11:31:09+0000,Dr. Prof. Vipul Vijay
