,"Joint Replacement Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I highly recommend Dr. Sushil Sharma to anyone who is considering joint replacement surgery. My aunt visited him for a knee replacement surgery one year ago, and she has been doing great ever since. The surgery was a success, and she has been able to return to her normal activities without any pain. My uncle also recently visited Dr. Sharma for a rotator cuff repair. The surgery was also a success, and he is already feeling much better. He was able to return to work after just a few weeks.
I was very impressed with Dr. Sharma's knowledge, skill, and bedside manner. He took the time to explain my aunt and uncle's conditions in detail and answer all of our questions. He also made sure that they were comfortable and informed throughout the entire process.
The facilities at the clinic were clean and modern. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend Dr. Sharma to anyone who is considering joint replacement surgery.",2023-07-20 10:36:41,False,True,Rahul Sharma,,,

Should not have visited the doctor.

Also, even when we had appointment, we were made to wait as he spent 30 minutes with his old patients.

He should be mindful of time of others.
