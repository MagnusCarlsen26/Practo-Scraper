Doctor Chirag is an exceptionally intelligent doctor with an encouraging and optimistic outlook. The patient becomes so confident that half of his disease is cured even before the treatment process begins. My father was worried initially but his team made it very easy. Our special thanks to Doctor Chirag Arora for guiding us on multiple fronts with his amazing credibility. Along with expertise and professionalism, these guys are also friendly and approachable.\n\nAlong with the doctors, we also found other staff decent, proactive and amazingly supportive. Assistance and instructions to the patient from the nursing staff were clear. Staff ensured that the patient was given utmost attention. Food service is extremely important for patient care in hospitals and we found this hospital to be quite good in this area as well.  maintains cleanliness throughout the day, several times to ensure that the ward/rooms remain disinfected. The patient support from the support staff was excellent. Thanks again Dr Chirag for your support and consultation.",

Our special thanks to Doctor Chirag Arora for guiding us on multiple fronts with his amazing credibility. Along with expertise and professionalism, these guys are also friendly and approachable.\n\nAlong with the doctors, we also found other staff decent, proactive and amazingly supportive. Assistance and instructions to the patient from the nursing staff were clear. Staff ensured that the patient was given utmost attention. Food service is extremely important for patient care in hospitals and we found this hospital to be quite good in this area as well.  maintains cleanliness throughout the day, several times to ensure that the ward/rooms remain disinfected. The patient support from the support staff was excellent. Thanks again Dr Chirag for your support and consultation.",
