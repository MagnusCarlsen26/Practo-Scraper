"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Spinal Surgery,",0,0,YES,"Really no words to express! Any doctor can prescribe, but only a few good ones can really heal. You are the latter.
He is like a Brother to God for us.
Then also gonna express my feeling and experience with Dr. Saurabh Rawall.
My Brother underwent Scoliosis Surgery(having a severe curve). Our first conversation with Dr. Saurabh Rawall made us so comfortable that we decided at that point to go for it. He explained each and everything so clearly we were satisfied with of all of those. Then also we were having fear in us but by the Grace of God, Surgery was successful. The moment Sir told me surgery is Successful, I thank God and Dr Saurabh Rawall who dedicately gave so much of his time with Dr Alok Gupta. Thank you for everything that you have done for us; the hospital environment has always made me nervous, but you made it bearable. Thank you for all of your services.
Dr Saurabh Rawall is not the best doctor everyone expects but hardly finds.

His Assistant Dinesh is also a nice person.
I pray to God that no one should have such disease but in any case if he or she have would really recommend Dr Saurabh Rawall undoubtedly.
Superheroes don’t wear capes, they wear aprons and save us in our hard times. So grateful for your service!
May God bless Dr Saurabh Rawall, Dr Alok Gupta and their families and have bright future.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Spinal Therapy,",0,0,YES,"Thanks, Almighty God, for enabling me to choose Dr. Saurabh Rawall for my surgery of cervical myelopathy (C5-C6, C6-C7 Spinal cord decompression surgery). Problem was started in Oct 23 from pain in arms and shoulders, after a week it slipped into paralysis of lower body with numbness/ stiffness. It was very dangerous for me as I was not able to walk, gut was involved so no motion for 2-3 days and due to this my office job and daily routine was disrupted. I searched for the best surgeons in Delhi NCR for approx. 3 months and consulted 14 -15 top spinal surgeons in Delhi NCR, underwent physiotherapy and sought homeopathic treatment, nothing worked, eventually, I met with Dr. Saurabh Rawall.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Spinal Disc Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I have been visiting Dr. Saurabh Rawall for several years now. He has always been very supportive and calm, never recommending surgery as the first option. He has always advised me to exercise and keep the posture right. I did not pay attention to my health and finally had to opt for surgery after a couple of slip-disk episodes. Again, this was not the first or only option that Dr. Saurabh advised. However, when my MRIs showed that exercising will not help, he asked me to consider surgery. I visited doctors in AIIMS and Medanta for a second opinion. Shockingly I got terrible advice from AIIMS and Medanta doctor also gave me bleak scenarios. Dr. Saurabh’s advice on what to expect during surgery and post-surgery recovery was spot-on. I was put at ease by his crew as well. My recovery has been easy. Dr. Saurabh has responded to my texts at odd hours when I needed his opinion. I would recommend Dr. Saurabh to anyone suffering from back-pain or needing spine surgery. He is an experienced and very well-qualified doctor with excellent academic credentials and surgery experience. ****** **** ******* ***** ** **** *** *** *** ******** **** * ************ ******* ",2022-06-20 09:18:58,False,True,Aparajita Mahajan,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Spinal Surgery,",0,0,YES,"Every Journey has its own story, ups and downs, struggle and destination. Sometimes we get good hand holders, well-wishers and companion, those make this very easy and smooth. This is my Health Journey.

Few months back, felt sciatica/ Numbness and severe back pain, This was not only back pain, its become kind of essence gone out of life. I tried all options suggested by friends, relatives and all well-wishers. And that highly myth and mis-conception to avoid spine surgery was there in my mind also after so many advises.

My health journey become very easy with God blessings and I found good doctor by luck. By the grace of God I met Dr. Saurabh Rawall, Apollo Hospitals Delhi, I specially loved and impressed how Dr. Saurabh really took his time to explain my conditions with me as well as my treatment options. Discussed all my worries and post operations effects, Life after surgery. And my love of badminton also again come in my queries. I had a really positive visit and the doctor's approach and such a friendly attitude really put me at ease. There only I made my mind to go for surgery under him. 

He is one of the best human being, whom I ever met. A very down to earth person with magical hands and skills as a Doctor. I took many opinions for surgery , met number of Doctors, but his true and positive feedback on my spine condition, made me comfortable for open spine surgery. He is always available for his patients , he even replied on Whatsapp on my reports and queries prior to my Apollo appointments.

Before and after operation his visits , meeting with my family members , update on my condition was really a feel of family member. After Operation when I became conscious , his smiling face with words “ How are your Rupesh” , made me very comfortable.

During my stay at Apollo, Never felt that we are in hospital, Well behaved staff, caring medical team. Doctors/ Nurses/Physiotherapist, all are dedicated and committed to patients.  

Now, Almost one month after my surgery, Feeling comfortable and get rid of my back pain, Now with confidence, I can suggest that if anyone having spine issues , meet Dr. Saurabh in early stage of problem, Will be advised best of treatment. Me and my family really thankful & grateful to Dr. Saurabh  and his team for my successful spine surgery. Hope I will start badminton after few months as he advised.
