Orthopaedic treatment not only involves medicines and exercises but also therapy in the form of ultrasonics/IFT/SWD which are given by an expert physiotherapist. 

Having gauged your problem, it would not have been wise to start the exercises right away without controlling the pain first. That is the reason you were advised to visit the physiotherapist to take a session and learn and perform the exercises under direct observation. 

A guided rehabilitation would decrease the chances of you doing them wrong and worsening the condition. 

You were also advised that once you have learnt the exercises correctly you need not come back to the hospital every day but do the exercises at home correctly.

I would also like to bring to your notice that all services are charged seperately. You may have very well visited any physiotherapist of your choice if the fees were an issue.",2020-06-09T09:49:10+0000,Dr. Reetadyuti Mukhopadhyay
