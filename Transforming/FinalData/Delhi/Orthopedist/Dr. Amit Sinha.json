After getting it removed, the pain completely subsided and I\u2019m now able to walk as much as I want to. \nDr. Amit is the friendliest doctor I have ever met. He also helps through texts and calls which is the most convenient way in today\u2019s time. I definitely recommend Dr. Amit to the people reading this. ",

Took care of my mom like her mom, even sent exercise videos to help us. Was easily approachable over phone also whenever needed.\nToday my mom started to walk with support of belt after so many years.\nWe can't thank you enough Dr Amit sinha for your constant support and guidance.\nMay god bless you always \ud83d\ude4f",
