Most importantly he seemed more worried about curing the patient rather than only focusing on money. He never suggests any costly tests or medicines until and unless it is necessary for the patient.",

I can`t say enough good things about Dr. Anil Arora and his team, who did an outstanding job . The entire staff is just great! Most of the time my uncle forget  even have knee replacements.

Then we went to his website and found him highly qualified, highly experienced so, we went to visit him at his clinic at Hargobind Enclave, East Delhi. He did the examination of my mother's Hip. With in a week Total Hip Replacement was carried out and everything goes so smoothly.\nIt has been six months now, she is doing well and walks every day 4-5 Km.\nI strongly recommend Dr. Arora, an honest, trustworthy, knowledgeable and skilled Doctor.

My uncle was afraid for the replacement surgery because of all the things he hear about when people have complications after surgery. My uncle had bi-lateral knee replacement in last March and after some hard rehab he was able to playing football match with my team in May end.! I can`t say enough good things about Dr. Anil Arora and his team, who did an outstanding job . The entire staff is just great! Most of the time my uncle forget  even have knee replacements. My advice to anyone considering knee surgery is to approach it with an open mind and great determination to recover quickly. Thank you all.",

Then we went to his website and found him highly qualified, highly experienced so, we went to visit him at his clinic at Hargobind Enclave, East Delhi. He did the examination of my mother's Hip. With in a week Total Hip Replacement was carried out and everything goes so smoothly.\nIt has been six months now, she is doing well and walks every day 4-5 Km.\nI strongly recommend Dr. Arora, an honest, trustworthy, knowledgeable and skilled Doctor. He is the best Joint Replacement Surgeon in Delhi-NCR.",
