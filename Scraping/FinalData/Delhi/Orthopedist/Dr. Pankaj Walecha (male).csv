,,0,0,YES,🙏Dr Pankaj Walecha studies the case very carefully then he decides the line of treatment.If the surgery is required then only he recommends.He gives you full space to decide.                                       I have full confidence in him. I got bilateral TKR  and THR done from him .It was like my son taking care of me and helped to overcome the pain and regain my confidence..He is always there when ever I need him.God bless him.,2020-09-17 19:42:15,False,True,Anita Arora,,,
