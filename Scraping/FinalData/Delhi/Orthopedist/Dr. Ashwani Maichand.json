He made it free inside, today even after coming back from there I have many questions, will I have to meet him again for that, will I have to pay a fee of \u20b9 1700 again for this..?  But this is not right, very few people raise objection, t**** ** * ******* **** **** ******* ******* I came to Dr. Ashwani ji after watching the video\u2026 And one more thing, I was told that 1500 appointment charge.  Isn't it \u20b9 1700, \u20b9 200, I don't know what was taken for registration which was not told on the first call, I don't know but from many people if you charge any fee then complete details about it.

Just look at one X-ray and tell them that you just do this, you will be fine, I had many documents from the latest ones like 2 MRI X-rays but the doctor did not even touch the MRI out of them, I had to undergo a test within 5 minutes.  He made it free inside, today even after coming back from there I have many questions, will I have to meet him again for that, will I have to pay a fee of \u20b9 1700 again for this..?  But this is not right, very few people raise objection, t**** ** * ******* **** **** ******* ******* I came to Dr. Ashwani ji after watching the video\u2026 And one more thing, I was told that 1500 appointment charge.  Isn't it \u20b9 1700, \u20b9 200, I don't know what was taken for registration which was not told on the first call, I don't know but from many people if you charge any fee then complete details about it.  Give these future calls to your patients... But none of my confusion went away after meeting the doctor...",
