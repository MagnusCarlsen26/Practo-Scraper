He also very graphically explained the anatomy of my condition so I could truly understand how to deal with it.\r\n\r\nHe treated me as if I was a close relative or a best friend. \r\n\r\nI also found his level of expertise to be beyond any quantified level because it became obvious to me that his professional knowledge of his field is simply without limits.\r\n\r\nLastly - I would enthusiastically recommend Dr. Manoj Padman as the one - and only one to see and consult with regarding any orthopaedic condition - especially if surgery is a consideration.

My son had a complaint of bow shaped leg .On physical examination he had confirmed that child looks normal and to confirm if everything is fine he had suggested few X-rays which we got it done right at that time and showed him the films of the X-ray on which he reconfirmed that X-rays are also normal by the time he turns two and half he should start walking normal and the bow should finish. Me and my family were happy with the positive answer and as per his suggestion we did not start any medication.  On 28th July I went to collect the written report from the  hospital in which it was mentioned suggestive of Rickets. Looking at the written report I couldn\u2019t stay calm and I started contacted the doctor on 29th July however their was no response from his side till 2nd August . After 4 days when I again called the doctor, his assistant is telling me that doctor is now saying that we need to run some test and need to see the child again and he agreed that he had overlooked the X-ray flims and now he is also suggesting that it could be rickets . I am writing this review for the other family and kids to please think 100 times before approaching this doctor *** **** ***** ** *** ******** ** **** ***** *** ** **** **** * ******** * If I would have not collected the written report of my son and would have gone through Dr Padman words ** **** ***** *** **** ***** **** **** ** ***** ***** ***** ** ***** I am attaching the reports and the prescription ***** ******* ***** *** ** ***** ********* ** *** **********\nOn 2nd of August I had reported this issue to rainbow hospital which in return had connected me to Dr. Shivani (medical director ).

My son had a complaint of bow shaped leg .On physical examination he had confirmed that child looks normal and to confirm if everything is fine he had suggested few X-rays which we got it done right at that time and showed him the films of the X-ray on which he reconfirmed that X-rays are also normal by the time he turns two and half he should start walking normal and the bow should finish. Me and my family were happy with the positive answer and as per his suggestion we did not start any medication.  On 28th July I went to collect the written report from the  hospital in which it was mentioned suggestive of Rickets. Looking at the written report I couldn\u2019t stay calm and I started contacted the doctor on 29th July however their was no response from his side till 2nd August . After 4 days when I again called the doctor, his assistant is telling me that doctor is now saying that we need to run some test and need to see the child again and he agreed that he had overlooked the X-ray flims and now he is also suggesting that it could be rickets . I am writing this review for the other family and kids to please think 100 times before approaching this doctor *** **** ***** ** *** ******** ** **** ***** *** ** **** **** * ******** * If I would have not collected the written report of my son and would have gone through Dr Padman words ** **** ***** *** **** ***** **** **** ** ***** ***** ***** ** ***** I am attaching the reports and the prescription ***** ******* ***** *** ** ***** ********* ** *** **********\nOn 2nd of August I had reported this issue to rainbow hospital which in return had connected me to Dr. Shivani (medical director ). After explaining her the entire scenario I was expecting that she would help me in taking some action against the doctor . However in return she started favouring Dr. Padman. I had put all my effort to save other parents by not putting their child in hands of this doctor but I failed because rainbow hospital instead of supporting their patients *** ********* ***** ***** ****** * Dr. Shivani on each call had only insisted me to come to hospital and meet the doctor and resolve the issue, she didn\u2019t had any other solution for my problem but to only mutually solve it by meeting the doctor. * ******* *** *** **** ** ******* ******** **** ******* ** **** ** ********* *** ******* ******** *** *** ******** *** **** ******* * * **** ***** ** ****** ****** ** ******** * ** *** ***** ***** ** ******* ******** **** *** **** ****** ********* ****** **** ***** ** ********** ******** *** ***** ** ********** ******** *** **** **** ****** ** ***** **** ** *** ***** *** ****** ***** ******** ***** ** ******** ***** \n\nSo please to all people who are reading this review do not consider taking consultation from Dr. Manoj padman .******** ** ***** ** ** ***** ****** ",
