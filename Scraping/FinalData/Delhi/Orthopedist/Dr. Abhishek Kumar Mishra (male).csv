Regarding your observation I would like to point out that unfortunately orthopaedics as a branch has many emergency consultations some of which I delegate to my juniors but some of them I need to see personally which causes the occasional delay.
Nonetheless you have rightly pointed out this delay can be troublesome for the patients and it is our constant endeavour to streamline the system in order to serve my patients in a better way

These days for meniscal tear in young patients arthroscopic meniscal repair is being done routinely World over.It is a minimally invasive surgery and hundreds of such surgery are being performed every week all over the world.
In fact ‚Äòsave the meniscus ‚Äòis the idea which is more pertinent for younger generation so whenever a young patient with a meniscal tear approaches an orthopaedic surgeon it becomes more of a duty of the surgeon to inform the patient about this treatment option.It is up to the patient to take the call whether he or she wants to undergo the knife as none can force surgery upon a patient.A doctor can just counsel the patient about the options available.

About the medication, everybody knows it is not a good idea to take painkillers for a long time and it is a common practice to use nutritional and pharmaceutical supplements for the purpose of repair and healing.As these are not painkillers they take a longer time to have their effect (what you are calling a long course )
In fact Rs.8000-Rs.10,000 is too little a price to pay for saving a knee without surgery.It is not only highly unlikely but completely impossible that anybody in my clinic would directly or obliquely suggest you to buy these medicines at my clinic pharmacy only.These medicines are widely available outside and everybody is welcome to buy it at their convenience.The pharmacy at the clinic is for convenience of patients who want all the important facilities under one roof.Medicines manufactured / marketed in the capital of a country cannot be called local and the same medicines from foreign brands and foreign manufacturers cost at least 3 to 4 times more which many people would happily buy thinking if it is manufactured outside India it will work better little knowing the fact that India is one of the largest exporter of pharmaceutical products worldwide.Similarly generics can be available at a lower price but sometimes the quality of generics can be questionable. I am really not sure about the doctors with whom these medicines were cross checked because I am pretty convinced that any busy orthopaedic surgeon worth his salt would have the luxury of having free time to advise you about just the medication prescribed by other orthopaedic colleague and considering you consulted many other Orthopaedic surgeons (Doctor‚Äôs )it is obvious the money you spent in consulting these doctors must have been way more expensive than the cost of these medicines which you are finding expensive or not reasonable.A doctor can only attempt to treat the condition With evidence-based and prevalent practises .A personal whim and a biased opinion helps neither the Doctor nor the patient.
Wishing you a speedy recovery
