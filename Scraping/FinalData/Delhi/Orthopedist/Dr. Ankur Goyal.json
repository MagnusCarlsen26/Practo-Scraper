When I visited Dr. Ankur, he attentively listened to my symptoms and the problems I was facing. The medication he prescribed was spot on! I had been taking other painkillers before, but they weren't giving me any relief. However, the ones he prescribed worked perfectly!\nHe explained everything in detail, which gave me great satisfaction. I would rate the whole treatment 10 out of 10. He is definitely one of the best orthopedic surgeons around. Thanks so much for the amazing treatment. I am really thankful and glad that I came across such an amazing doctor. Thank you for the work you do!",

I had been taking other painkillers before, but they weren't giving me any relief. However, the ones he prescribed worked perfectly!\nHe explained everything in detail, which gave me great satisfaction. I would rate the whole treatment 10 out of 10. He is definitely one of the best orthopedic surgeons around. Thanks so much for the amazing treatment. I am really thankful and glad that I came across such an amazing doctor.
