Patient was told about the finding in the X-rays  and was assured that there is nothing significant in X-rays  and we can able to treat it by giving some medication and life style modification as patient is chronic smoker used to smoke 15 cigarette a day .
Accordingly patient was advised anti inflammatory /ointment and calcium supplement and exercise protocol 
Patient was given 35 min for consultation and doctor left the clinic at 10 pm along with housekeeping .
It was correct that there is no other staff because it was 10 pm in night and all staff leave at 9 pm .
