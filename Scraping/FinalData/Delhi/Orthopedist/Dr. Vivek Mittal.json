He tooks the patients pain very seriously and suggest the best treatment to ease their life routines.My Mother in Law got the TKR (Total Knee Replacement) by him 2 weeks ago and her recovery is too good.

After dilly dallying for quite some time and discussing with quite a few doctors, I finally landed in the hands of Dr Vivek Mittal in BLK Max. It was a pleasant surprise against whatever I heard of Bilateral Total Knee Replacement, he made it sound so cakewalk. And during and after surgery, he proved himself very right. On the first day after surgery, I was made to sit cross legged, walk on Walker. On the 2nd day, I was walking with him without any Walker or walking stick at all. So far, my recovery graph seems excellent and uneventful. \nThanks to Dr Vivek Mittal, his team, the ICU workforce and the excellent nurses and ward staff. \nSettling the bills was also a walk on air ",

My knee osteoarthritis had worsened through years of neglect and I was slowly losing my mobility. After having consulted a good many joint replacement surgeons, my wife suggested I try out BLK hospital. Despite my reservations and hesitancy to go under the knife I was gradually assured by Dr Mittal in the course of  a few visits, to go in for bilateral knee transplant as it was the only option that would ensure my recovery and normal gait. \n\nTo be frank I was most impressed by Dr Mittal's detailed explanation of the procedure and his impressive description of the\nmanner in which I would only stand to benefit from it. Audio visual presentations helped me to understand every nuance of the upcoming surgery better. The entire surgery was a painless session thanks to Dr Mittal.\n\n\nIt is now nearing five months and I am beginning to see the change in my walking after intense physiotherapy sessions. I am fully satisfied with Dr Mittal and hope that I continue to recover fully. I would highly recommend Dr Mittal for anyone with orthopaedic issues.",
