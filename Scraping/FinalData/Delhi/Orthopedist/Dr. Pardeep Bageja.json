I was immediately rushed to Maharaja Agrasen Hospital Dwarka and there we met Dr. Pardeep Bageja. After initial investigations of the x-ray reports he explained that the fracture is severe and I had to undergo a surgery and some internal fixation needs to be done to make the ankle functional. The surgery was planned after two days of fracture and I was very anxious about the surgery and OT. Dr. Bageja nullified that horrifying experience by his friendly nature with his patient, More over he is very cool with the OT staff and very vigilant in the process, I could recall that he engages with all the people in the OT and keep them self motivated to learn and perform well in his procedure. \nPost surgery I use to visit him on regular intervals for routine checkups and also arranged the change of dressing at my hone. Throughout the process he ensured that the recovery should be least painful and it should be perfect in all respects so as to avoid future complications. I was very much satisfied with my complete treatment procedure and appreciate doctor's effort during my treatment. \n",

She fell and fractured her hip bone, and surgery was the only way to treat her. Once all the pre-tests were done, it was concluded that she is highly unfit for the surgery due to her heart condition as well, hence Anesthesiologist refused to proceed. However,  the Doctor was very confident that he could perform the surgery , which speaks volumes about his experience and skills in his field. This put a lot of confidence in us as well and we were ready to go ahead with the surgery , Although we had to move my grandmother to a different hospital in which the Doctor also helped us a lot.\n\nFinally the surgery was successfully done and my Grandmother is safe and back home, still recovering though. However, the Doctor is still in touch with us for all the post operation procedures.\n\nHe indeed is great and supremely skilled in his field, and the best thing I appreciate and grateful for is that he stayed in touch ever after the treatment was over and happy to help and answer any concerns we have over the phone , Highly recommended !!\n\n\n",

I was not sure if I could get rid of the pain permanently with only medicines but after 2 months of taking the medicines prescribed by Dr. Pradeep I stopped feeling pain when doing my daily activities.

I was immediately rushed to Maharaja Agrasen Hospital Dwarka and there we met Dr. Pardeep Bageja. After initial investigations of the x-ray reports he explained that the fracture is severe and I had to undergo a surgery and some internal fixation needs to be done to make the ankle functional. The surgery was planned after two days of fracture and I was very anxious about the surgery and OT. Dr. Bageja nullified that horrifying experience by his friendly nature with his patient, More over he is very cool with the OT staff and very vigilant in the process, I could recall that he engages with all the people in the OT and keep them self motivated to learn and perform well in his procedure. \nPost surgery I use to visit him on regular intervals for routine checkups and also arranged the change of dressing at my hone. Throughout the process he ensured that the recovery should be least painful and it should be perfect in all respects so as to avoid future complications. I was very much satisfied with my complete treatment procedure and appreciate doctor's effort during my treatment. \n",

She fell and fractured her hip bone, and surgery was the only way to treat her. Once all the pre-tests were done, it was concluded that she is highly unfit for the surgery due to her heart condition as well, hence Anesthesiologist refused to proceed. However,  the Doctor was very confident that he could perform the surgery , which speaks volumes about his experience and skills in his field. This put a lot of confidence in us as well and we were ready to go ahead with the surgery , Although we had to move my grandmother to a different hospital in which the Doctor also helped us a lot.\n\nFinally the surgery was successfully done and my Grandmother is safe and back home, still recovering though. However, the Doctor is still in touch with us for all the post operation procedures.\n\nHe indeed is great and supremely skilled in his field, and the best thing I appreciate and grateful for is that he stayed in touch ever after the treatment was over and happy to help and answer any concerns we have over the phone , Highly recommended !!\n\n\n",

He suggested some.pain killers and medicines along with an advice for an MRI scan after 3 or 4 days, if relief is not experienced. But fortunately it worked and I got ok and routine also became normal in one week without any pain. No MRI later also.\nThanks Dr Pradeep.",

He detects the core reason for the problem in the first visit itself. He is approachable and friendly by nature where in you can freely ask and discuss about your medical problems. Since then whenever I have any muscle or bone related pain and issues I always reach to him and he is always just a call away. Recently I visited him for my severe pain in the neck and right shoulder and like before his medication healed me pretty soon. It is rare to find such doctor where in you see the result so soon. Highly recommended!!",
