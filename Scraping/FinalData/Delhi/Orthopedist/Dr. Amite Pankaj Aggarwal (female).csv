I totally Recommend the Doctor

My Mother was having severe pain in her both knees from last 10 years and now it was very difficult for her to take 2-3 steps. We visited Dr. Amite Pankaj Ji at Fortis on 12th December, 2023 and he explained the problem in detail and suggested for Total Knee Replacement . We were very tensed related to knee replacement but Dr Amite and his team explained in a very good manner that it will be a 2-3 hours process and patient will take start recovering within 2-3 days. She was hospitalized for 5 days and now I can see smile on face of my Mother on day of discharge.
Post Surgery also Dr. Amite meet on daily basis for 4 days to my Mother and assured her that she will get perfect soon.
Ms. Vandana , team member of Dr. Amite also helped us in various ways and she was available on one call.
Mr Akshay Singhal, Physiotherapist helped my mother a lot and also motivated her that she can take steps and walk. Physiotherapist team including all girls member was very cooperative.
Ms. Geetanjali, Night Shift Nurse taken a good care of My mother.
Satisfied with Dr Amite Sir and his team.
