"Wait time,","Lower Back Pain,",0,0,NO,"Horrible experience at the clinic. I had booked an appointment and still i was made to wait for more than 45 minutes just because of the inefficiency of the staff member Rupam to manage the patients. There was no sequence being followed and even when the doctor noticed that i have raised this issue, he didn't bother to intervene or help. The receptionist replied arrogantly when i asked her about her negligence to manage patients. No complaint about the treatment and the doctor was polite and friendly. But i wish he would have paid more attention to the management of his staff instead of just focusing on the consultation fees flowing in. I will definitely not recommend anyone to visit this clinic.
