,,0,0,YES,"Hello everyone myself Mr. Bhola shankar,  I am from Bihar(India). Currently I am leaving in New Delhi. 
Today I am going to tell about Dr. Neeraj godara who is very prominent and skilled Dr. for hand & wrist related concerns.
Unfortunately when was 10 years old I met an accident 20 years ago in which my write hand wrist got deformed badly due to improper treatment. 
When I met Dr. Neeraj godara as I told about him by someone else , he suggested me to going through a surgery  and I decided to prepared myself for surgery 
Finally I go  through a long surgery of  approximately 6 hours  by Dr. Neeraj godara in the first step of bone reconstruction and flap growing.  After 6 months of this step an onother surgery of 2 hours performed for tendon repairing and thumb movement by Dr. Neeraj godara. And Now I am working properly with this hand much better than earlier. 
So I would like to suggest you all that you have any concerns with your wrist and hand you should definitely take consultancy with Dr.  Neeraj godara as he is a very prominent and skilled Dr.  Also his behavior is very down to earth, lenient, polite, soft. he is very friendly to patients. 
I am very obliged to him. üôè
