"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Paediatric care,",0,0,YES,"My little guy is 4.10 years now. He is called Taksh. 
It’s close to 5 years now and we have never ONCE thought of another neo-natal or paediatric care for our son. 
Stories :
   1. We recommended Dr Gaurav Jawa to our closest friends.  One couple was carrying twins and nursing a high risk pregnancy. They visited us in hospital when Taksha was delivered and the same night, the water broke. They called me in the hospital at around 1.10am. I spoke to the concerned and the Gynae and Dr Jawa and all else were in the hospital before the patients arrived. 45 mins and twins were delivered. She was due for January, but this was Oct 27th. 
I have watched up-close Dr Jawa handle these Pre-mature kids. His confidence, his experience, his compassion, his warmth and love has been magical. 
On day one he informed the family : 
A. They are “this weight”. They would be discharged in “xxx” days with weight “Cy” kgs.he did just that. 
B. The mother would not be away from the kids … in fact should spend time with the little ones and from time to time. 
C. I saw him have the kids fed one drop at a time. 

He did exactly what he said. Today these twins are super healthy, super vibrant. 

 2. My wife and I have been travelling all over for work. Irrespective of the distance we had to travel to see the doc, we never once doubted our decision. Absolutely NON-commercial. Completely against antibiotics unless absolutely required. Understands a child more than most moms (put together). 

3. This is the best - he will talk to your kid like you never did. Your kid hasn’t started talking yet - no problem - this Dr will hear his problems. You see Dr Jawa consult your kid, once - and you’d know why I’ve said what I have. 

4. Dr Jawa sits in south delhi. I’m now in Kerala. My kid is 4.10years. If there is one person I’d like to talk to for his health, it is Dr jawa. P.S. whether it be a video call through Practo or flying to Delhi - Id do it. 
I’ve known more than a few dozen couples who consulted Dr Jawa. Never once, not a single time have I heard a negative.",2021-09-21 14:54:48,False,True,Ankit kothiwal,,,

,,0,0,YES,"I have been seeing Dr. Jawa since my daughter's birth, and she is 2 now. I truly trust him and appreciate his calm and composed demeanor with both kids and new parents especially.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Fever,",0,0,NO,We visited him for the treatment of our 5 months old daughter who was getting fever frequently due to UTI. Doctor prescribed the medicine and advised to give 14 dose only and after those 14 dose we went to see him to be assured that UTI has been cured. ******* *** **** ** **** **** **** ***** *** you don't have to give any medicine now and because of that our daughter suffered from UTI again within a week. For which I texted him on WhatsApp but he didn't reply. Even he hasn't seen the message till today and I'm writing this review after 5 months of this incident so anyone can sense that how takes care of his responsibility.
