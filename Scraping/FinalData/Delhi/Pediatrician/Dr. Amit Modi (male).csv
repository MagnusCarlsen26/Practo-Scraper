"Treatment satisfaction,","Childhood Infections,Adolescent Followup & Vaccinations,Paediatric care,",0,0,YES,I had been going to Dr. Amit Modi for my child's vaccinations and other treatment.

"Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,",,0,0,NO,"Did the video consultation with doctor for my son.

He vomitted 5-6 times within an hour and was not able to keep even a single drop of water in his stomach.

Seeing the serious condition, I had to take my son to hospital ***** **** ********* **** ***** *** *** ********* **********Height of the unprofessionalism is that the doctor replied late night of next day........
Non-responsiveness of a doctor towards the patient's serious condition is the least expected thing we can expect from a doctor.
I would never recommend this doctor. 
",2022-12-25 05:41:17,True,False,Verified Patient,"Online Consultation has limitations, one should understand this before going for an online consultation. An emergency or serious condition can never be handled over online consultation. 
Online consultation is only for the primary management, if not improving you have to rush to your doctor or hospital physically. As medicines prescribed over online consultation is based on symptoms of the patient described by the attendant without examining the patient. 
Follow up consultation for an online consultation over practo is generally answered as per schedule of the doctor and may some time take 24 hour. 
Writing a review is fine, but abusing someone's profession and credibility is not acceptable. 
All the medicine adviced for your son was in good faith, as per the symptoms described by you. ",2022-12-27T01:15:05+0000,Dr. Amit Modi
