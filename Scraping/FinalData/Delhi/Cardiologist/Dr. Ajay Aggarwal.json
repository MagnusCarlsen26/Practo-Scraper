Answers each and every question to the point without beating around tge bush. Minimum tests prescribed with minimum medicines. Now that depends on the health issue. Highly recommended. I visited for chest pain, breathlessness and anxiety. And it was my second visit to the doctor within 2 months. Amazing doctor. Half of your problems would be solved by his soft spoken words. Good diagnosis too. Thank You Doctor. Regards Ishani",

Answers each and every question to the point without beating around tge bush. Minimum tests prescribed with minimum medicines. Now that depends on the health issue. Highly recommended. I visited for chest pain, breathlessness and anxiety. And it was my second visit to the doctor within 2 months. Amazing doctor. Half of your problems would be solved by his soft spoken words. Good diagnosis too. Thank You Doctor. Regards Ishani",
