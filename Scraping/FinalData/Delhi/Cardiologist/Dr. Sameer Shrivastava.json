That he is preeminent in his field, having served humanity for close to four decades in best hospitals in Delhi (last few years as the head of non invasive surgery) is just one small part of why he is such a good doctor. It is his approachability, patient friendly manner and genuine concern for the patient well being and interest that separates him and places him ahead in the pack of luminaries. He is quick in his diagnosis and explaining the treatment choices. Only the other day, Dr. Sameer took just a few seconds in diagnosing an underlying cardiac issue causing falls to my 74 year old friend who was previously hospitalized and being treated by an eminent neurologist for some esoteric neurological conditions!\nThough a skeptic in essence, I accept Dr. Sameer word about my disease and treatment as Gospel and actually look forward to my quarterly visits! I have known very few doctors with brilliance in academics, huge experience & international renown display such rare humility and compassion as Dr. Sameer does. Kudos Dr. Sameer...I wish and pray that you keep doing this for aeon! You are a real savior- of both body and soul! Amen!!\n",

That he is preeminent in his field, having served humanity for close to four decades in best hospitals in Delhi (last few years as the head of non invasive surgery) is just one small part of why he is such a good doctor. It is his approachability, patient friendly manner and genuine concern for the patient well being and interest that separates him and places him ahead in the pack of luminaries. He is quick in his diagnosis and explaining the treatment choices. Only the other day, Dr. Sameer took just a few seconds in diagnosing an underlying cardiac issue causing falls to my 74 year old friend who was previously hospitalized and being treated by an eminent neurologist for some esoteric neurological conditions!\nThough a skeptic in essence, I accept Dr. Sameer word about my disease and treatment as Gospel and actually look forward to my quarterly visits! I have known very few doctors with brilliance in academics, huge experience & international renown display such rare humility and compassion as Dr. Sameer does. Kudos Dr. Sameer...I wish and pray that you keep doing this for aeon! You are a real savior- of both body and soul! Amen!!\n",
