"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",,0,0,NO,Well unfortunately I have lost my Mother last month. We were consulting Dr from February but our last appointment with Dr has been delayed too much due to Corona lockdown. It was not on time. Dr prescribed us some new medications and most of them are same and one of them got removed. This prescription was for 2 months but my Mother hardly suffered 9 days as she was constantly feeling shortness in breathing and next morning she had an Heart failure. However Dr was really nice in the first 2 appointments *** *** ************ *** ******* ****** ***** *** *** **** ************ **** ** ****** ****** *****,2020-06-20 11:07:58,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
