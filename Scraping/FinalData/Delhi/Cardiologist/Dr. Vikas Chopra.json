Without relenting Dr Chopra took Echo also which confirmed that there were no problems with heart except anginal pain.He apprised that only peripheral issues were there and everything is ok. His approach is plain and no unwarranted alerts and the best part is he has ECG, ECHO and TMT and the diagnosis is very fast due to it and the rates are also very reasonable.

He was very polite and made sure i understand the reason for my pain. He gave minimal medication. Not only i am feeling much better now, i am really in awe with the simplicity and the kindness of him and the simple treatment from him. I would highly recommend him for sure.",
