"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Sarcoidosis,",0,0,YES,The doctor diagnosed my problem of the auto immune disease Sarcoidosis in 2012 and helped me handle the multiple problems through conservative treatment.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Respiratory tract infection,",0,0,NO,*** ** ******* *************** I booked appointment from meerut to visit in Delhi Max Saket. His assistant called on appointment 11.30 during my office time day to visit early  by 4.00 instead of scheduled appointment of 6.00 pm . I tried all my possibilities to reach Delhi and inform the assistant that after entering in Delhi I will be possibly reach by 4.20 . So as per his discussion the doctor refused by saying that he has a meeting. So what about a patient who is travelling from a long way for getting treatment and suggested that come to Gurgram centre tomorrow. Is it that easy for him to just cancel the appointment. Or if he would have at his personal clinic he would be visiting for an hour for getting the patient cum customers. ******* ************** *** ** ******** ******** *** ******* ** ********** ***** ******** * **** ******** **** * **** *******,2024-02-29 11:22:00,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
