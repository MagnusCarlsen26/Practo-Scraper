Someone gave you wrong information that it's manufacture in laxmi nagar, as no medicine manufactures in laxmi nagar. As no manufacturing plant can't be here.\n\nIn case if you find difficulty in buying any prescribed medication or any cost burden, you should contact treating doctor , so that, he can able to advised you the same alternative that suited best for you. \n( Instead of putting blame game on your treating doctor after a month time )\n\nAs many pharmacists gives alternative without  having proper information of composition.\n\nHope you are doing well and look forward to redressal your complaints. \n\nRegards,\n\nDirector, PHC\n\n",

We didn't get a hospital bed and he helped us treat her at home. With his treatment, advice, and help we kept her stable for 8 days, till we got an ICU bed. He was available at all times for any advice needed or when my mother's health deteriorated. In a way, complete hospital-like treatment was set at home with his guidance - IV fluids and medicines. He even helped us get a bed and contacted many hospitals in this process. Finally, we got an ICU bed and could save her. \nThanks, doctor for your help and support in those tough times.",
