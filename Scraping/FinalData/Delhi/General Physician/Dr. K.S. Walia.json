Dr Walia visited within 10-15 minutes Diagnosed & immediately started the treatment. My daughter was better the very next day with his treatment. Appreciate his dedication & commitment towards the patient. His vast experience positive & helping nature makes him one of the best Doctor around. Would definately recommend him to anyone looking for good treatment for themselves.",

He pointed out some issues with my health that should probably have been addressed sooner and I'm going to see him every one to two weeks until we get all my problems sorted out. It's great to meet a doctor that isn't just trying to get you out the door as soon as they can. I would absolutely recommend him to anyone looking for a regular family doctor. Clinic seems nice and staff was helpful too.",

But the patient wanted her emergency treatment at her residence by a doctor whom I would suggest(Itold her it is not possible) Husband of the patient got up & passed comments  that today\u2019s doctors do not treat patient by seeing pulse &eyes of the patient(Means What?) Today\u2019s doctors are only commercial, they  only treat patients after Lab Reports & other investigations and patients are referred to hospitals for treatment of emergency cases . Being doctor Iwas more concerned About the well-being of the patient rather than money . This patient was not charged even a Rupee",

Seemed to be in a hurry to get rid of us. So much so that he didn't even ask the patients name. Maybe we disturbed his sleep schedule. Also, even though it says the clinic opens at 5 in the evening, it doesn't. The help/compounder/whatever is very unhelpful as well. Please do not go if it is an emergency or you need an urgent consultation. Very unprofessional.",
