He was available at all points of time when I needed him and listened to my queries patiently.He boosted my morale so much so that he became a member of our family. The plan is cost effective as well.\nIf anyone plans to opt for a better health I would definitely suggest DrPankaj as the best person to approach due to his loving caring service. Wishing Dr all the best in future endeavours.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

Last month so many misinformation very floating  over the internet, social media. Somebody was telling me to get CT scan done, do multiple test of blood tests. One mantra he told me for Covid: not to get worried if O2 level is good  & fever is not a point of concern. In a couple of days my fever subsided under  his medication. Post 28th April 2021,  I recovered  and was under his watchful eyes post Covid treatment .** ** * **** **** ******* ****** ************** will ample loads of patience and friendliness.

I followed Dr\u2019s diet for 6 months n to my surprise all the parameters are satisfied on testing blood n urine at Amrita hospital Kochi.\nI was a bit hesitant in d beginning, but the concerted efforts of dr. to see me in a healthier condition is indeed appreciated.\nI thank my son for referring to Dr Pankaj who is a very dedicated  n sincere doctor. He was available at all points of time when I needed him and listened to my queries patiently.He boosted my morale so much so that he became a member of our family. The plan is cost effective as well.\nIf anyone plans to opt for a better health I would definitely suggest DrPankaj as the best person to approach due to his loving caring service. Wishing Dr all the best in future endeavours.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

My wife and son recovered in a week's time, but my fever was hovering around 99 to 100 degree. I was deeply concerned and slightly  worried also. Last month so many misinformation very floating  over the internet, social media. Somebody was telling me to get CT scan done, do multiple test of blood tests. One mantra he told me for Covid: not to get worried if O2 level is good  & fever is not a point of concern. In a couple of days my fever subsided under  his medication. Post 28th April 2021,  I recovered  and was under his watchful eyes post Covid treatment .** ** * **** **** ******* ****** ************** will ample loads of patience and friendliness.

The best thing about Dr. Pankaj is that he doesn\u2019t use a one size fits all template. He listens to your problem, understands your food preferences, and then provides a plan that can be implemented with minimum effort. I had travel planned for last week of June and was very skeptical about the same thinking about how to follow the plan. When I spoke to Dr. Pankaj he was kind enough to change my diet plan to meet the local food requirements. I understand that I have a long way to go in terms of weight loss but with Dr. Pankaj\u2019s vision, it can be done holistically avoiding any fancy food or crash diets.",

Then I searched for Dr Pankaj and visited his clinic He gave me ample time to understand the root cause, then suggested urine and blood culture test along with few other tests. There was problem with my urine and Dr. Pankaj suggested one injection for five days along with few tablets and one syrup, surprisingly I started feeling far better from day 2 only. He is one of the best doctors as per my personal experience . Thank you Dr. Pankaj ",
