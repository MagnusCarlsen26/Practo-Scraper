As we all know this pandemic has affected each one of us in some way. \nThank you Dr. Ramit for being so friendly and for giving healthy diet advices. The way you advised felt like you\u2019re a very honest person with outmost humanity, loving & caring. Thank you for the diet chart which you shared that\u2019s so beneficial and easy to understand which vegetables or products provide what vitamins.\nApologies for reaching late once again. But thank you so much for understanding the situation we were in. \nLastly, thank you Mr. Sanjay the most helpful person. since the time I have booked an appointment Mr. Sanjay made sure that we get to the location safely. \nI recommend everyone to book an appointment without giving a second thought as trust me it is worth it. Such generosity and humbleness isn\u2019t found these day. \nI wish you all the best and please be the person that you are always. Thank you once again. Stay safe \ud83d\udc4d",

We had heard of Dr Ramit Sambyal as he enjoyed good reputation in our society.\nDr Ramit listened to my problem very patiently and examined me in details. He immediately understood the problem and quickly administered fluids as I was loosing water in my body. Antibiotics were also infected with the fluids.He detained me in the clinic for about four hours After that I was feeling much better. During this period,Dr Ramit was very friendly and proved his medical acumen. His approach toward his patients is very professional and caring.\nI feel totally impressed by Dr Ramit and strongly recommend to patients to consult Dr Ramit for any ailment or during emergencies.\nGood luck to Dr Ramit Sambyal ",

As we all know this pandemic has affected each one of us in some way. \nThank you Dr. Ramit for being so friendly and for giving healthy diet advices. The way you advised felt like you\u2019re a very honest person with outmost humanity, loving & caring. Thank you for the diet chart which you shared that\u2019s so beneficial and easy to understand which vegetables or products provide what vitamins.\nApologies for reaching late once again. But thank you so much for understanding the situation we were in. \nLastly, thank you Mr. Sanjay the most helpful person. since the time I have booked an appointment Mr. Sanjay made sure that we get to the location safely. \nI recommend everyone to book an appointment without giving a second thought as trust me it is worth it. Such generosity and humbleness isn\u2019t found these day. \nI wish you all the best and please be the person that you are always. Thank you once again. Stay safe \ud83d\udc4d",

We had heard of Dr Ramit Sambyal as he enjoyed good reputation in our society.\nDr Ramit listened to my problem very patiently and examined me in details. He immediately understood the problem and quickly administered fluids as I was loosing water in my body. Antibiotics were also infected with the fluids.He detained me in the clinic for about four hours After that I was feeling much better. During this period,Dr Ramit was very friendly and proved his medical acumen. His approach toward his patients is very professional and caring.\nI feel totally impressed by Dr Ramit and strongly recommend to patients to consult Dr Ramit for any ailment or during emergencies.\nGood luck to Dr Ramit Sambyal ",
