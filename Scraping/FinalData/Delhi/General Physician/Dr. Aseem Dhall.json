During the treatment he suffered a heart attack and was immediately prescribed to be shifted under the cardiology department Though we were apprehensive at first to undergo heart treatment from spinal hospital due to its specialization more towards spinal related injuries, we  were made comfortable by Dr. Aseem Dhall, Head of Cardiology, who handled the situation with utmost care and professionalism.\n\nMy father was on ventilator and angiography was the immediate requirement. Dr. Dhall  patiently answered our queries relating to the procedure and we were greatly impressed by the confidence *** ********* ** *** *******\n\nAngiography was successfully done and the doctor advised that no further surgical procedure is required and medications will be the right treatment along with following an healthy lifestyle. \n\nIn addition, the overall facilities at the Saroj Cardiac Centre at Indian spinal injuries Centre are excellent and my father was discharged after a full recovery compared to the day of admission. \n\nDr. Dhall was very friendly but professional at the same time which gave us the confidence and peace of mind. \n\nGreatly appreciate and grateful to Dr. Aseem Dhall. \n\nRegards\n",
