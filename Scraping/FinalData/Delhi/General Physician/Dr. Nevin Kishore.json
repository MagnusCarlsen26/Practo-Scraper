So as per his discussion the doctor refused by saying that he has a meeting. So what about a patient who is travelling from a long way for getting treatment and suggested that come to Gurgram centre tomorrow. Is it that easy for him to just cancel the appointment. Or if he would have at his personal clinic he would be visiting for an hour for getting the patient cum customers. ******* ************** *** ** ******** ******** *** ******* ** ********** ***** ******** * **** ******** **** * **** *******",
