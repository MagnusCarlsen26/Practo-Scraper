Given the dire Covid situation in Delhi as its almost impossible to get timely help in these times, Dr Sehgal proved to be a blessing. Her oxygen was going upto 84 on lower side, when Dr Sehgal took her on. He not only helped with prescription, guidance and meds, but also kept a close watch on the patient remotely. While aunty is recovering well, he is currently helping my cousins family deal with Covid. Through all this, he was available at all hours for help. An amazing human being and a doctor.
