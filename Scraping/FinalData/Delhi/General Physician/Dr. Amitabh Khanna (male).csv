"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Diabetes Management,",0,0,YES,"I visited Dr. Khanna on 13th June'20 (ID AK 1250). Fortunately, I was the first patient there and was highly impressed with sanitization and social distancing managed at the place. (Dwarka Clinic)

Dr. Khanna listened to my case history with patience and went through the reports in detail. Due to my anxiety for good treatment, I asked him some things repeatedly to which he replied promptly.

Maybe I used some extra time for sharing and repeating the things (I am sorry for that) but he listened to them every time and prescribed the medicines accordingly.

Next, we were explained in detail about the diet regime and importance of physical activity (trust me all the things suggested by them are highly easy to do and it will not impact your lifestyle or food habits). - I can eat everything barring sugar only.

I am looking forward to improving my health and have a long-term relationship with Khanna sir.
