She didn't even let me in the room, started yelling at me out in the hallway for all other patients, nurses and doctors to see. When I asked her to let me explain my situation, she started dictating hospital policy at the top of her voice.\nI would have taken an appointment if she had politely turned me down or just turned me down, rather than creating a scene.\nAfter being shouted at by her in front of 50 or so people, I decided *** ** *** **** ** *** ***** *** respond in kind, not that I could due to my weakness, I just decided not to see her again ** * ***** **** ** ** ******* ** **** *******\nI understand that not every experience a person has with other people is nice, *** ** *** ****** ********* *** * ****** ****** I figured it deserved a shout-out!\nJust FYI, I have been diligently following her prescribed treatment for past 10 days, ** ****** **** * *****",
