She gives plenty of time to her patient and be never in hurry. I visited to Dr Srineeta Chowdhury for the intolerable pain in molar teeth of my 5 years old daughter. First I was very scared as my daughter is only 5 but she gave her treatment just like a mother. My daughter is now quite well and now she is a big fan of the doctor due to good behaviour of doctor towards her. Dr Srineeta explains each and everything in detail and never be in hurry. We are fully satisfied with Dr. Srineeta and now we have decided to consider her as our family doctor. She is really a great dentist it is very hard to find a doctor like her. I have also taken my teeth cleaning treatment through her the way of cleaning of teeth was the best no any sensation no any pain. ****** *** ******** ** *** **** ********",

The only option left was to go for treatment along with anaesthesia, which was challenging, time taking and costly. We consulted online Dr Sreenita via Practo app. Dr Sreenita understood our problem very well and she assured for best treatment. She mingled with my son very well. She spent enough time convincing him that the procedure will be painless and smoother. Finally with loads of effort doctor won son\u2019s confidence and treated him very well without anaesthesia. She addressed all painful areas, doctor brought my son\u2019s life on track. We stay abroad and we had very limited time, she treated all major issues in very short span of time. We are very thankful to Dr Sreenita for her kind help and perfect treatment.",

She gives plenty of time to her patient and be never in hurry. I visited to Dr Srineeta Chowdhury for the intolerable pain in molar teeth of my 5 years old daughter. First I was very scared as my daughter is only 5 but she gave her treatment just like a mother. My daughter is now quite well and now she is a big fan of the doctor due to good behaviour of doctor towards her. Dr Srineeta explains each and everything in detail and never be in hurry. We are fully satisfied with Dr. Srineeta and now we have decided to consider her as our family doctor. She is really a great dentist it is very hard to find a doctor like her. I have also taken my teeth cleaning treatment through her the way of cleaning of teeth was the best no any sensation no any pain. ****** *** ******** ** *** **** ********",

The only option left was to go for treatment along with anaesthesia, which was challenging, time taking and costly. We consulted online Dr Sreenita via Practo app. Dr Sreenita understood our problem very well and she assured for best treatment. She mingled with my son very well. She spent enough time convincing him that the procedure will be painless and smoother. Finally with loads of effort doctor won son\u2019s confidence and treated him very well without anaesthesia. She addressed all painful areas, doctor brought my son\u2019s life on track. We stay abroad and we had very limited time, she treated all major issues in very short span of time. We are very thankful to Dr Sreenita for her kind help and perfect treatment.",
