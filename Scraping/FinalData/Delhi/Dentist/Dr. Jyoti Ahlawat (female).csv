Hello
We always aim to provide top quality dental experience to each of our patients and take each and every feedback in a constructive light to improve our services. The digital radiograph has been emailed at the mail id mentioned by you in your patient registration form. We tried reaching you on the phone number that you provided via practo portal while booking appointment and at time of registration process with our staff, however despite numerous attempts at our end, the number stayed switched off /unavailable. We would also like to mention that despite multiple requests by our staff to wear shoe cover inside operatory area for disinfection & hygiene purposes, u chose to ignore that and walked in the surgical operatory with your slippers on a rainy day. We understand it can be challenging for a patient due to past dental experiences over a decade ago to understand the scientific difference between an IOPA X-ray where you are provided the x ray film and a digital format of imaging like RVG, however you insisted on a physical copy of X-ray while arguing and shouting at our front desk staff and at the attending doctor in front of other patients. This happens to be a significant event that we take very seriously since it compromises the dental environment for patients who are awaiting their treatment after you. We hope you give us a chance to improve your experience next time. Have a good day.",2024-07-03T06:09:11+0000,Dr. Jyoti Ahlawat
