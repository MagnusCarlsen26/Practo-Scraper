I was so impressed with the result and the staffs that I continued with my tooth capping, extraction, etc. from here only.\n\nDoctors and Staffs: Dr. Naina and Dr. Ashish are very kind and cooperative. They both helped me understand what the problems were and personally curated solutions, best for me, were offered to me to choose from. The assistants Rakhi and others too are very friendly, but very respectful at the same time, which finally enhanced the experience of the treatment.\n\nEquipment and Clinic: The equipments are clean and sanitised after each patient\u2019s treatment. They have created a good ambience of the clinic also where soft piano music from \u2018River Flows In You\u2019 by Yiruma to \u2018Scientist\u2019 by Coldplay are played in background, making the patient calm during the treatment.\n\nWay Forward: Pretty sure my future dentist appointments are also going to be with them only as long as I\u2019m in Delhi.\n\nThank you Dr Naina, Dr Ashish and Team.",

For rcts and cavities filling, I was very comfortable almost all the time with  few moments of pain which were also bearable.\nSo for your rcts and cavities filling or to fix your smile I can confidently vouch for Chopra dental clinic, you can go to the clinic without any doubts in mind, just have some patience  and rest all they will take care of.\nWill update my review after my further treatment is done.\nThank you",

The assistants Rakhi and others too are very friendly, but very respectful at the same time, which finally enhanced the experience of the treatment.\n\nEquipment and Clinic: The equipments are clean and sanitised after each patient\u2019s treatment. They have created a good ambience of the clinic also where soft piano music from \u2018River Flows In You\u2019 by Yiruma to \u2018Scientist\u2019 by Coldplay are played in background, making the patient calm during the treatment.\n\nWay Forward: Pretty sure my future dentist appointments are also going to be with them only as long as I\u2019m in Delhi.\n\nThank you Dr Naina, Dr Ashish and Team.",
