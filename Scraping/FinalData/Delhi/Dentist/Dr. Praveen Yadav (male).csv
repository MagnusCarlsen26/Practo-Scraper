,"Dental Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I have visited Dr. Praveen for dental surgery.  The extraction was bit complex and I was afraid as well because it was my first ever dental visit for any reason. Doctor has explained the problem very clearly and he made me feel confident & comfortable with this procedure. He assured that it will be 30 mins procedure with assurance of pain free. The same happened. The surgery was pain less. And it's been 3 days now, I am not facing any issue. Also doctor gave his number to connect any time if any issue happens.
I truly appreciate his way of treatment and friendliness with patients. Recomend the doctor. Easy to reach and available on weekends as well.
Doctor is highly recommended for dental issues.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Cosmetic/ Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"I visited this clinic today because I was concerned about my premolar extraction for braces. On quora and YouTube comments on the topic of 'extraction retraction regret' filled with negative reviews and people are saying that many problems come with premolar extraction like flat face, TMJ pain, Airways problem little space in mouth for tongue and sunken face etc. I'm 25 years now and I'm getting my braces treatment from somewhere else because I didn't know about Dr Praveen yadav earlier. My orthodontics suggested to extract two upper premolar because I've Crowded teeth. 
After reading all these negative reviews I was nervous for my facial change and problems bcz I've already extracted 1 premolar and was about to extract next 1.
So I discussed all these issue with Dr Praveen yadav and he said not to worry not even a single problem comes with extraction of premolar. 
Finally I'm going to continue my journey of braces",2024-01-14 11:24:41,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
