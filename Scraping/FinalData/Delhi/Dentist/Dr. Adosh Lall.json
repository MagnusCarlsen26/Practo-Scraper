I was suffering from multiple issues with my teeth. \n\nBefore sharing  the feedback, one word to say, what a TREMENDOUS PERSONALITY DR ADOSH.  I just forgot everything by hearing his voice and polite way of talking.\n\nNext day when I visited the hospital, he welcome with a grand happiness and elaborated each issues bit by bit without any hurry leaving huge smile on my face.  I was feeling like cureness has already begun without starting the treatment.\n\nI salute his utmost level of treatment......his commitment and assurance regarding the action plan, i.e completely awesome. \n\nI had connected with him around 40 minutes,  he was continuously trying to encouraging me and  building the trust. He was too friendly.\nHe is a great human being  gifted by smile and always sharing the same to all.\n\nTreatment point of view, ** ** *** **** *** ************ Once meet him and bring your smile back....\n\nThank You\nNutan Jha\n\n",

I was suffering from multiple issues with my teeth. \n\nBefore sharing  the feedback, one word to say, what a TREMENDOUS PERSONALITY DR ADOSH.  I just forgot everything by hearing his voice and polite way of talking.\n\nNext day when I visited the hospital, he welcome with a grand happiness and elaborated each issues bit by bit without any hurry leaving huge smile on my face.  I was feeling like cureness has already begun without starting the treatment.\n\nI salute his utmost level of treatment......his commitment and assurance regarding the action plan, i.e completely awesome. \n\nI had connected with him around 40 minutes,  he was continuously trying to encouraging me and  building the trust. He was too friendly.\nHe is a great human being  gifted by smile and always sharing the same to all.\n\nTreatment point of view, ** ** *** **** *** ************ Once meet him and bring your smile back....\n\nThank You\nNutan Jha\n\n",

We will look forward to treating you and correcting any omissions.  \nRegards, \nDr Adosh lall ",
