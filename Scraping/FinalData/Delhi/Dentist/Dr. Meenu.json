My entire treatment journey has been painless and very effective. I was described each and every process in detail and the methods here are very systematic to give an effective outcome. \nI got root canal treatments done where I lost the hope of saving the teeth but Dr meenu's efforts have helped my regain my confidence and saved natural teeth. \n\nFor me she has been a saviour. \nI recommend her strongly to all those who are looking forward for a systematic approach and outcome based treatment options.  She is your final stop. \n\nThanks Dr meenu for making me smile again.",

From the moment I entered the clinic, I felt welcomed and at ease.\n\nDr. Meenu Dhiman is undoubtedly one of the best dentists I have come across. Her expertise and skill in providing dental treatments are truly commendable. I had to undergo a root canal treatment, and she made sure it was a painless experience for me. Her gentle approach and precision in handling the procedure were remarkable. I didn't experience any discomfort throughout the process, which is a testament to her expertise.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of House of Dentistry is the affordability they offer without compromising on the quality of the treatment. The pricing is fair and reasonable, which is quite refreshing in today's healthcare landscape. I appreciate that they prioritise providing affordable dental care without compromising on the excellence of their services.\n\nMoreover, the best thing that I liked about House of Dentistry was their strict adherence to sterilization protocols. Dr. Meenu Dhiman ensures that all instruments are sterilized and maintained hygienically. This attention to detail regarding sterilization practises provides a sense of security and safety for patients.",

My entire treatment journey has been painless and very effective.

She is your final stop. \n\nThanks Dr meenu for making me smile again.",

From the moment I entered the clinic, I felt welcomed and at ease.\n\nDr. Meenu Dhiman is undoubtedly one of the best dentists I have come across. Her expertise and skill in providing dental treatments are truly commendable. I had to undergo a root canal treatment, and she made sure it was a painless experience for me. Her gentle approach and precision in handling the procedure were remarkable. I didn't experience any discomfort throughout the process, which is a testament to her expertise.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of House of Dentistry is the affordability they offer without compromising on the quality of the treatment. The pricing is fair and reasonable, which is quite refreshing in today's healthcare landscape. I appreciate that they prioritise providing affordable dental care without compromising on the excellence of their services.\n\nMoreover, the best thing that I liked about House of Dentistry was their strict adherence to sterilization protocols. Dr. Meenu Dhiman ensures that all instruments are sterilized and maintained hygienically. This attention to detail regarding sterilization practises provides a sense of security and safety for patients.",

I had been suffering from tooth ache since long and had been controlling my problem with antibiotics and painkillers. I visited this clinic and doctor explained my problem in detail and also discussed the whole treatment plan with me. I felt comfortable after talking to Dr Meenu and immediately sat for treatment after knowing the I'll effects of consuming unnecessary antibiotics. To my surprise even after the treatment I was not prescribed any antibiotics but only mild painkillers. My problem is perfectly cured and the side that I had not been using since one and a half years to chew now I can eat from that side also.\nI highly recommend this clinic in Dwarka Sec 9 for any dental problems.",
