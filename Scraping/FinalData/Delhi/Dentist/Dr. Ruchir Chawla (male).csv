The tooth was completely decayed and broken and had all roots carious and damaged which was examined by x ray investigation.  The only option for such badly decayed is removal or extraction.  The tooth had sepis and pus discharge and keeping such tooth is also hazardous for adjacent teeth.  We can save tooth by performing root canal treatment but for that the roots need to be in healthy condition and not rotten with some crown structure to support fillings and crowns which was not there in your case.  We only perform legitimate procedures keeping in mind treatment should be successful in future and not few day affair. As relationship between patients and our clinic is long lasting and based on trust, which is the pillar of our practice and motto. Keeping prognosis of procedure as prime is basis of successful treatment and a must.  Hope you understand and if you would have visited clinic few years back and not let it rot for so many years we could have saved the same.  That is why the only option extraction was suggested.
