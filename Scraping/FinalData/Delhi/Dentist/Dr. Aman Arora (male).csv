"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Ceramic Veneers / Crowns ,Sensitive Teeth,Traumatic injuries Dental,Dental Cleaning,Braces Adjustment,",0,0,YES,"It all started in October 2019 with lots of sensitivity in my teeth and also a headache. But it was Dr Dimple and Dr Aman who were so commendable  in detecting the root issue and I am glad that I followed their advice and got my self braces even at the age of 30; I was hesitant  for a while in deciding though, but I am glad I did. It not only had an aesthetic but also cured all my sensitivity  and headache problem and can't appreciate much for their thorough professional work with a very friendly and assuring touch of theirs. Honestly speaking they are actually and only the one dentist specialist on whom I can blindly trust on. I really do not know that whether it is actually correct to say that or not actually but where all the other dentists just keep their original focus not on treatment, there they and their humbleness in treating me actually like their own little daughter is really commendable. A large thank you to themThey have solved all my teeth problems so seamlessly so now it is that I feel that people do not keep praising them just like that.An ideal dentist for me for the method with which they actually cured my tooth issues so early as well as so perfectly, without a single root canal, I feel others may not be able to do the same.Thankfulness is all I want to express to you my dentist.¬†Regards Laxmi",2021-01-30 06:55:29,False,True,Laxmi Joshi,Thank you Laxmi for your so kind words.
