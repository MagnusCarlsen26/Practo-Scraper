I still remember sir telling me then that this is the best cap and does not have metal in it. I got treatment done under the DGEHS panel and that time I was working. I had been informed then that this will not be covered under the panel and I chose to go with this cap and paid the amount. I am happy to be associated with sir and now I have come after so many years for my third molar RCT. I was told to take the tooth out and it can't be saved. But I had confidence and came here and my decision was correct.. Really happy. God bless u sir and keep on doing good work",

I still remember sir telling me then that this is the best cap and does not have metal in it. I got treatment done under the DGEHS panel and that time I was working. I had been informed then that this will not be covered under the panel and I chose to go with this cap and paid the amount. I am happy to be associated with sir and now I have come after so many years for my third molar RCT. I was told to take the tooth out and it can't be saved. But I had confidence and came here and my decision was correct.. Really happy. God bless u sir and keep on doing good work",

Special shout to Dr Divya who was my endodontist for RCT did a wonderful job but also ensured the treatment was painless and pleasant.\n\nOn top Rohit gave me sufficient information along the way which help me understanding the cause , the treatment and also how I should be looking after my teeth going forward, which was great.\n\nFinally I would like to thank Dr Rohit Malik and his entire team for looking after me so well. \n\nI will highly recommend Dr Rohit Malik and Delhi Dental Hub for any dental treatment.

Dr Rohit himself is friendly and puts you to ease asa you meet him. Followed all covid protocols.\nAll the staff was highly professional and gave me mental satisfaction too overall.\nI went for scaling , while got done filling too, it was a seamless experience. They are equipped with updated dental tools- for me it was important because of my sensitive teeth, scaling has never been so easy and painless for me. Came out with a happy face and satisfaction. They shall be my go-to dental centre for sure :)",

The post surgery instructions were Crystal, and the pain after my surgery was minimal. The doctor answered and expounded upon every single one of the questions I asked him, and I ask a lot of questions. An excellent experience, apart from the fact that I had to get my tooth removed, but that's nothing on the dentist.",
