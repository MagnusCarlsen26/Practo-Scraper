Helpful and friendly staff.\nWhile it took several sittings to complete the procedures, I am quite happy with the end result.

Doctor gave ample time to listen all questions and answered them patiently.A lady doctor shared diagnosis of x-ray and also talked about different implants options available along with their pros and cons.

I guess they want to keep prices of implant unofficial but not sharing diagnosis and consultation detail on plain white with no clinic reference is quite unusual \u2013 perhaps first in my recent memory.Despite asking twice for pain relieving medicines, **** ****** ****** ********* *** ********* ** *** *** ******* ** ***** ** ***** ******* ********I called clinic from pharmacy after realizing that \u201cplain consultation paper\u201d has only details of implants and its costs but no medicines, I was then asked to wait for few minutes so they can send medicine names on WhatsApp.After waiting for another 15 minutes, I again called clinic and then someone from clinic sent me medicine names.\u00a0I got the impression that Doctors were more interested in implant procedure than helping me in severe root pain which was my first reason to visit Dr. Setia clinic.",

After the first consultation he started insisting on implants and when i totally refused, his attitude changed, he reluctantly agreed for bridge. On the day of extraction, i filled a form where i stated that i was allergic to penicillin. I also specifically told the doctor that i wanted only extraction that day and the rest to be completed on another day, after extraction which was pretty painful he convinced me to sit for there next hour for tooth cutting for bridges.i was exhausted and went home in a bad condition and took the antibiotics prescribed by them. Next day I had an allergic reaction. My lips had swollen triple their size, i immediately called him to check if i should stop the antibiotic and sent him a photo. A junior doctor from his office called and said that it was not an allergic reaction and i should continue the medication. 3rd day he called me for the fitting of a temporary bridge where i showed him that my  upper palette had severe ulceration and pain due to allergy, he still disregarded and told me to continue taking medication and fitted my teeth with an ill fitting temp crown. 4th day my allergy was so severe, i rushed to a nearby doctor where  he confirmed that i was suffering a severe allergic reaction, told me to stop medication immediately and change my dentist. i had to make an emergency appointment with dheeraj setia as i was unable to eat and the crown was adding to the discomfort of the allergy, the consulting doctors at his own clinic confirmed my allergy but dheeraj came and said that this was a nervous reaction, and ive been to other dentists many times before never has anyone said this or have i had any allergic reaction. i could not eat anything for the next 10 days and the day my sutures were to be removed, he told me that he wanted to take the impression again, give more anesthesia for more cutting and i refused as i wanted to be sure of what caused my allergy. i told him that i would get the rest of the work done in my country after getting an allergy test, which is totally reasonable as I am concerned about my health. he saw that now the entire amount would have to be refunded which is 72000 minus extraction and cutting work, he started speaking rudely to my mother and me and didnt tell us how much he will return. after 10 days we got a msg from his clinic saying that they will charge 50000 for extraction and cutting work. we thought this was unreasonable. so my husband spoke to dheeraj setia and as a recorded call i have proof of him saying he will return 67000. after 10 days only 47000 was refunded with no explanation. ****** ****** ** **** **********   ",

Explained the details about my condition...answered all my questions and addressed all my concerns.\n3. Excellent Clinic...well laid out, spacious and very well designed.\n4. Helpful and friendly staff.\nWhile it took several sittings to complete the procedures, I am quite happy with the end result. And the extra sittings did not cost a paisa beyond what Dr. Dheeraj had originally given me an estimate of.\nWould highly reccomend Dr. Dheeraj of Dental Roots any time.\n\n",

Doctor gave ample time to listen all questions and answered them patiently.A lady doctor shared diagnosis of x-ray and also talked about different implants options available along with their pros and cons. She answered all the queries in length.I requested lady Doc for pain reliever medicine for my severe pain and also conveyed my wish to take second opinion before going for extraction   implant procedure.\u00a0****** ***** **** ***** **************Lady doctor shared photo copy of consultation on plain paper, with no clinic reference whatsoever. I guess they want to keep prices of implant unofficial but not sharing diagnosis and consultation detail on plain white with no clinic reference is quite unusual \u2013 perhaps first in my recent memory.Despite asking twice for pain relieving medicines, **** ****** ****** ********* *** ********* ** *** *** ******* ** ***** ** ***** ******* ********I called clinic from pharmacy after realizing that \u201cplain consultation paper\u201d has only details of implants and its costs but no medicines, I was then asked to wait for few minutes so they can send medicine names on WhatsApp.After waiting for another 15 minutes, I again called clinic and then someone from clinic sent me medicine names.\u00a0I got the impression that Doctors were more interested in implant procedure than helping me in severe root pain which was my first reason to visit Dr. Setia clinic.",

After the first consultation he started insisting on implants and when i totally refused, his attitude changed, he reluctantly agreed for bridge. On the day of extraction, i filled a form where i stated that i was allergic to penicillin. I also specifically told the doctor that i wanted only extraction that day and the rest to be completed on another day, after extraction which was pretty painful he convinced me to sit for there next hour for tooth cutting for bridges.i was exhausted and went home in a bad condition and took the antibiotics prescribed by them. Next day I had an allergic reaction. My lips had swollen triple their size, i immediately called him to check if i should stop the antibiotic and sent him a photo. A junior doctor from his office called and said that it was not an allergic reaction and i should continue the medication. 3rd day he called me for the fitting of a temporary bridge where i showed him that my  upper palette had severe ulceration and pain due to allergy, he still disregarded and told me to continue taking medication and fitted my teeth with an ill fitting temp crown. 4th day my allergy was so severe, i rushed to a nearby doctor where  he confirmed that i was suffering a severe allergic reaction, told me to stop medication immediately and change my dentist. i had to make an emergency appointment with dheeraj setia as i was unable to eat and the crown was adding to the discomfort of the allergy, the consulting doctors at his own clinic confirmed my allergy but dheeraj came and said that this was a nervous reaction, and ive been to other dentists many times before never has anyone said this or have i had any allergic reaction. i could not eat anything for the next 10 days and the day my sutures were to be removed, he told me that he wanted to take the impression again, give more anesthesia for more cutting and i refused as i wanted to be sure of what caused my allergy. i told him that i would get the rest of the work done in my country after getting an allergy test, which is totally reasonable as I am concerned about my health. he saw that now the entire amount would have to be refunded which is 72000 minus extraction and cutting work, he started speaking rudely to my mother and me and didnt tell us how much he will return. after 10 days we got a msg from his clinic saying that they will charge 50000 for extraction and cutting work. we thought this was unreasonable. so my husband spoke to dheeraj setia and as a recorded call i have proof of him saying he will return 67000. after 10 days only 47000 was refunded with no explanation. ****** ****** ** **** **********   ",
