He not only gave me correct advice, but also helped me understand the problem well and designed a future roadmap/action plan by which I can have excellent dental health. I flew down to Dwarka, New Delhi especially to get treated by him. I would strongly recommend JR Dental clinic, Dr. Avantika and Dr. Pranshu.. for patient not only in india, however outside india and living in abroad. Prices are very economical and treatment is very trustworthy. Thank you Doctor for having me here. ",

He not only gave me correct advice, but also helped me understand the problem well and designed a future roadmap/action plan by which I can have excellent dental health. I flew down to Dwarka, New Delhi especially to get treated by him. I would strongly recommend JR Dental clinic, Dr. Avantika and Dr. Pranshu.. for patient not only in india, however outside india and living in abroad. Prices are very economical and treatment is very trustworthy. Thank you Doctor for having me here. ",
