"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Hello everyone, 
I would definitely like to share with you all my experience. I had visited this clinic recently and met Dr.Naveen Bansal for my capping trestment ,where I got to learn that my root canal wasn't treated well earlier . It was only partially done in 1 canal out of 3. So I undertook a re-root canal treatment with doc which was quite time taking and strenuous. It seemed all went well . Now the measurement has been taken for capping and I expect just one more visit is required for capping process.  Earlier I didn't know that capping is so important.  I learned its importance by dr Naveen that if it is not used ,our tooth might break or get a crack later sometime in future so its safer to get it capped for long run.
I would like to thank and recommend Smile and care dental clinic to everyone .
