,,0,0,YES,Dr.Manreet and Dr.Prabhjot are hands down one of the most experienced dentists in town. Literally the best decision ever to choose them for all my dental work. I required braces and Dr.Manreet is looking after my Invisalign treatment and I have to say she is literally the most patient and professional dentist I've ever come across. She's always ready to clear out any doubts that I have. She planned the whole treatment according to my comfort and has so far given the best possible advice for it aswell. The staff is very professional yet sweet. They keep on checking up on you after extractions etc and its the most hygienic clinic.

,,0,0,YES,"Dr. Manreet is amazing! She’s very passionate about her work, very kind, professional, and friendly. I had braces for years (from a different doctor) and my teeth still didn’t go in, but Dr Manreet gave me confidence that I could have the perfect smile and she could fix it. My previous doctors told me it couldn’t be done, but Dr Manreet’s Invisalign treatment completely fixed my smile and I’ve never felt more confident! Going to her and getting Invisalign has been the best decision I’ve made. Her clinic is clean, very well decorated, the colors and design make you feel warm and comfortable and her staff is very nice.
