"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Ceramic Braces,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Aman Sachdev provided me with exceptional ceramic braces treatment to straighten my misaligned teeth. From the moment I began my treatment in June last year until its recent completion, the experience was nothing short of amazing.

Firstly, I was pleasantly surprised by the painless and smooth nature of the entire treatment process. Dr. Aman's expertise and skill in performing the braces procedure were truly remarkable. I felt completely at ease throughout the journey, knowing that I was in capable hands. His in-depth knowledge and understanding of dentistry were evident in every interaction with him. He patiently explained every step of the treatment plan and the logic behind it, addressing all my concerns and questions. Secondly, as per my request, he made it possible to straighten my teeth without tooth extraction. I now have a perfect smile with all my teeth intact.

Beyond his exceptional professional abilities, Dr. Aman's kindness and cooperative nature were truly commendable. He genuinely cared about my comfort and well-being throughout the treatment. His friendly demeanor and approachable personality created a warm and welcoming environment. He was always just one text or call away for any assistance. He always gave me appointments according to my preferences and set up my visits to his clinic on his own which very few doctors do. I never had to approach him for appointments or run after him to keep my treatment going which I have heard is a major problem that many people face with their dentists.

Most importantly, the end results of my ceramic braces treatment exceeded my expectations. His attention to detail and commitment are what make him an exceptional dentist. My teeth are now beautifully straight, and I couldn't be happier with the transformation.

I highly recommend Dr. Aman Sachdeva to anyone seeking orthodontic treatment or dental care. I am grateful for his exceptional work and the positive impact he has had on my smile and overall dental health. ",2023-07-10 18:16:49,False,True,Hira Naaz,,,
