After 24 years of my life, you have restored my smile😊. For these 24 years, I concealed my teeth, refraining from smiling openly in public due to the impact of a disastrous accident in 1999 that altered my teeth structure.

Commencing my treatment in February 2021 presented numerous challenges, including the hurdles of the pandemic, my battle with depression, and the continuous travel from Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam to New Delhi for treatment. 

Crucially, Dr. Srishti Bhatia addressed every single one of my concerns. Today, on November 16, 2023, I am pleased to share that my treatment has concluded successfully, and *I am entirely satisfied with the results.*👌👌

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to you for your unwavering effort and energy.
