Not only was my experience extremely positive, but I was also pleasantly surprised by the remarkable results of the teeth cleaning and whitening treatment they recommended. I wholeheartedly recommend their services to anyone in need of top-notch dental care.\n\nThe entire experience was pleasant from get go, the staff was well trained and followed up timely. The waiting area was clean and well-maintained, reflecting the overall professionalism and attention to detail of the practice.\n\nThe tooth filling procedure was conducted with utmost precision. Maj Dr. Vipin took the time to explain the process, ensuring that I understood each step and alleviating any concerns I had. Their expertise was evident, and I felt confident that I was in capable hands.\n\nI had a minor issue with the filling and the doctor made time to immediately attend to me and did not charge anything extra for it too.  The location is easily accessible. \n\nWould highly recommend ",

As per our records you have missed a few appointments as you said you are having a family problem and were given further appointments as soon as it was possible and a few were delayed because you didn\u2019t undergo extraction of tooth advised by treating Orthodontist Dr Nishant. The treatment has been delayed because of the unforeseen circumstances lockdown imposed due to COVID -19 Pandemic in 2020 and 2021 by the government.\nWe had discussed prior to starting your treatment that any treatment procedures besides the orthodontic treatment viz, extractions, oral prophylaxis, restorations etc during or after orthodontic treatment would be charged separately, which you had also agreed upon and given in your treatment estimate that has been received and signed copy is with a clinic for records.\nYour bills receipts were given to you whenever you asked for the same received copy signed by you is available with the clinic.& your treatment cost was also not 40k. you yourself dropped the treatment. \nas you are talking about 2.5% charges that I am not charging as it is charged by the bank when we make a card payment. as we did your treatment at a very low discounted price so initially only we told you about payment methods also which you agreed also.",

They have stalled my treatment for the past 1.5 years. They only put braces of the upper teeth and did not start the treatment for the lower teeth and when I requested them again and again to start the treatment, they simply refused saying that I didn't know better. The tooth extractions which are a crucial part of the treatment were not included in this treatment and I had to pay 2000 rupees extra every time the doctor asked me for a tooth extraction. I got two tooth extraction done and they charged me 4000 rs extra apart from my treatment which was outrageous but I still went for it because I wanted my treatment to be smooth. Also, The doctor always accepts all payments in cash and makes excuses if you ask for an online payment or even a bank transfer. He asks you to pay 2.5 percent charges upon the payment if you want to pay with the debit card which is although more inconvenient for us and convenient for the doctor since there are no records of the money that you have paid. I had to make extra efforts to withdraw all the money in cash as he never accepted any payments via credit debit cards.Up untill now I have paid more approx 40000 for the whole treatment and my treatment is not even halfway completed.\nAlso, when I asked the doctor for bills for the amount that I had already paid, He simply refused and said that I should trust him with my money. After alot of discussion and me pushing him,  he finally handed the bills after 3 months of treatment. Also, the appointments are always fixed according to the availability of the other doctor that Dr.vipin hired. They will never consider your requests for appointments. Once they have taken the money from you, you will have no say. Please do not visit for braces. I had a horrible experience before I finally decided to end my nightmare and drop him. Now I am being handled by a qualified doctor. Also I didn't get money back after I dropped them so I am out of 40K and 1.5 years have passed and my treatment is no where. ** *** *** ******* *** ************ **** * *** ** **** **** ** **** ******",

The waiting area was clean and well-maintained, reflecting the overall professionalism and attention to detail of the practice.\n\nThe tooth filling procedure was conducted with utmost precision. Maj Dr. Vipin took the time to explain the process, ensuring that I understood each step and alleviating any concerns I had. Their expertise was evident, and I felt confident that I was in capable hands.\n\nI had a minor issue with the filling and the doctor made time to immediately attend to me and did not charge anything extra for it too.  The location is easily accessible. \n\nWould highly recommend ",

As per our records you have missed a few appointments as you said you are having a family problem and were given further appointments as soon as it was possible and a few were delayed because you didn\u2019t undergo extraction of tooth advised by treating Orthodontist Dr Nishant. The treatment has been delayed because of the unforeseen circumstances lockdown imposed due to COVID -19 Pandemic in 2020 and 2021 by the government.\nWe had discussed prior to starting your treatment that any treatment procedures besides the orthodontic treatment viz, extractions, oral prophylaxis, restorations etc during or after orthodontic treatment would be charged separately, which you had also agreed upon and given in your treatment estimate that has been received and signed copy is with a clinic for records.\nYour bills receipts were given to you whenever you asked for the same received copy signed by you is available with the clinic.& your treatment cost was also not 40k. you yourself dropped the treatment. \nas you are talking about 2.5% charges that I am not charging as it is charged by the bank when we make a card payment. as we did your treatment at a very low discounted price so initially only we told you about payment methods also which you agreed also.",

They have stalled my treatment for the past 1.5 years. They only put braces of the upper teeth and did not start the treatment for the lower teeth and when I requested them again and again to start the treatment, they simply refused saying that I didn't know better. The tooth extractions which are a crucial part of the treatment were not included in this treatment and I had to pay 2000 rupees extra every time the doctor asked me for a tooth extraction. I got two tooth extraction done and they charged me 4000 rs extra apart from my treatment which was outrageous but I still went for it because I wanted my treatment to be smooth. Also, The doctor always accepts all payments in cash and makes excuses if you ask for an online payment or even a bank transfer. He asks you to pay 2.5 percent charges upon the payment if you want to pay with the debit card which is although more inconvenient for us and convenient for the doctor since there are no records of the money that you have paid. I had to make extra efforts to withdraw all the money in cash as he never accepted any payments via credit debit cards.Up untill now I have paid more approx 40000 for the whole treatment and my treatment is not even halfway completed.\nAlso, when I asked the doctor for bills for the amount that I had already paid, He simply refused and said that I should trust him with my money. After alot of discussion and me pushing him,  he finally handed the bills after 3 months of treatment. Also, the appointments are always fixed according to the availability of the other doctor that Dr.vipin hired. They will never consider your requests for appointments. Once they have taken the money from you, you will have no say. Please do not visit for braces. I had a horrible experience before I finally decided to end my nightmare and drop him. Now I am being handled by a qualified doctor. Also I didn't get money back after I dropped them so I am out of 40K and 1.5 years have passed and my treatment is no where. ** *** *** ******* *** ************ **** * *** ** **** **** ** **** ******",
