I searched for dentists nearby my residence & I am really thankful that I came across Dr. Renu Sharma ma'm. She patiently listened to my problem over phone & keeping my suffering into her account, even in this situation of pandemic she agreed to open her clinic & called me for treatment the very next day. It is only actually because of her very treatment that I so very soon recovered from my pain and was actually able to eat properly which I was unable to do previously due to the pain in my teeth. Bighearted thanks to you ma'm, thank you for bringing back my smile\ud83d\ude4f",
