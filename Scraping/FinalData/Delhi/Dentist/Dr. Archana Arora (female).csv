",2020-08-30 05:24:01,False,False,Verified Patient,"Definitely sir...I regard your opinion...you have every right to feel overcharged...
Firstly it's was a four unit case
Secondly..the bottles of 3M company cost way more than just 1000 bugs as quoted by you.
Thirdly, definitely I have not done your case at first place .. ideally it's your dentist's duty to fix it for you till number of years she has given you the guarantee for... normally we advice the patient to visit his/her own dentist at first place
I was helping you out during covid times as your doctor was not available.
So for me you are a new patient and so OPD has to be charged . because these days we cannot do a patient without proper PPE kit(for your safety) which has additional charges..
I'm extremely sorry if you felt that way...but I cudnt help you out in that.
