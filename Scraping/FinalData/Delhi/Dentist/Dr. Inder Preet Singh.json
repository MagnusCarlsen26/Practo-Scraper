While I was in college one of my tooth ached and I went to see an dentist in our area. She was an amateur and did a check up on my other teeth mentioning actually what was a coffee stain on my teeth as five cavities. I am an avid tea drinker. While I was scared to learn this I explored more dentists in our area and came across Inder when I heard from a couple of friends about his practice. And he explained to me about oral hygiene and what I should do to reduce cavities and coffee tea stains on my teeth. Without his help I may have actually got all the fillings done. ** ** *** **** ** ***** I have shifted out of Delhi but I visit him when there is an issue and for regular check ups.
