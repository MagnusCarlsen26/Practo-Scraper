Officer of NCT Delhi) on 19 may for denture since I had fed up with one dentist nearby my residence  (he could not deliver the right denture even after ten weeks and returned my money) a lot of harassment and pain suffered with his hit and trial method. Visited again on 24 may. \nMeanwhile I suffered severe  pain in one of my teeth. I consulted learned Dr on 25 may and subsequently visited clinic at mayur vihar on 26 may Dr did not attend me personally instead one junior did. Till date I have been suffering for the same after a long gap of more than  two \nweeks.out of five sittings Dr himself has taken three whereas two by juniors. I have been told that teeth severely infected same time anti bio.  course taken. \nI am 63 year plus and undergone many RCT but this time much longer time. The cause/reason best known to Dr. \nHow much more time required I can't see. \nRest is fine high end machines installed for quick *** ******** ********** Great and warm regards\n",

I visited almost 10 to 12 times for RCT for couple of tooths but it's still not fixed properly. I also face trouble getting proper original bills and after many follow ups for days, we get the final bill that too of amount lesser than what we actually spent in their clinic!! The most important thing half of my treatment was done by some other doctor as i was in lot of pain and doctor was not available, still so many visited at Dr. Budhiraja clinic.",

Visited again on 24 may. \nMeanwhile I suffered severe  pain in one of my teeth. I consulted learned Dr on 25 may and subsequently visited clinic at mayur vihar on 26 may Dr did not attend me personally instead one junior did. Till date I have been suffering for the same after a long gap of more than  two \nweeks.out of five sittings Dr himself has taken three whereas two by juniors. I have been told that teeth severely infected same time anti bio.  course taken. \nI am 63 year plus and undergone many RCT but this time much longer time. The cause/reason best known to Dr. \nHow much more time required I can't see. \nRest is fine high end machines installed for quick *** ******** ********** Great and warm regards\n",
