"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Dental Fillings,",0,0,NO,First time in my life I have seen such a doctor with very bad attitude. From the very first interaction she behaved very rude. We thought it may be a difficult day for her.

 patient took new appointment for 9th october 12:00pm and reported 15 min late and without old prescription which they were already told to bring back in next appointment.., now how m i supposed to remember wat was discussed n prescribed 1 month back! 
now if according to you i behved rude in first interaction itself then why did you visited my clinic 3rd time.. if i had a bad attitude then why did you bring your child to my clinic... why did you take appointment for 9th october.. why dint your child cried during treatment.. why did your child took those reward smiley

actually the main issue was that one of the tooth needed RCT which you were not willing to get it done from first day itself.. so patient told me according to google my treatment plan is not right.. so i told them i cant do treatment according to google advice.. we make diagnosis according to clinical scenario and follow treatment plan. When parent were asked to look for some other doctor as we cant work according to google their ego got hurt and father started shouting in our reception area that his queries should be answered.. we can answer a human queries not  google queries.. he started threatening that he will give a negative review.., thats what he has done a false reweiw for attending a rude patient 3rd time amd not giving treatment according to his google advice
V are not robots like u IT people.. U came with your own google diagnosis wanted me to work according to your treatment plan‚Ä¶ M sorry m a doctor not a Robot or computer who works according to commands of IT sector ..
