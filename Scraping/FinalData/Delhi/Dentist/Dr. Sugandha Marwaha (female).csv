,,0,0,YES,"**** ** *** **** ********* ******* ******** *** ***** Dr. Henna and Dr. Sughandha both are so patient with my kid. The staff is welcoming and nice, most importantly they help my kid relax and have a good experience at the dentist. The clinic is so kid friendly and that makes our visits be fun. I feel like they provided a lot useful information in every one of our visits. Dr. Henna never rushes us, but always explains what is going on with our kid and what‚Äôs her recommendations are. Highly recommend this practice, specially if you have little ones who are nervous about seeing the dentist.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Paedodontics,",0,0,NO,"I visited Dr. Sugandha's AIMIL clinic to get my daughter's tooth cavity treated in August 2023. We attended four of the five visits planned by her and didn't like her attitude *** **** ****** as she neither conveyed the cost of the treatment before the treatment nor the justification of it after the treatment. I want to stress that,  she only explains the details of the treatment but not the cost- I am stressing this point because I saw many reviews where it was written that she explains very well. Being a healthcare provider I understand the importance of conveying cost of the treatment to the patient.
