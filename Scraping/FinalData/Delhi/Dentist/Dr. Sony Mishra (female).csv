You talk about our prices when you only visited us for a Consultation. Before your visit, you had already had a long and detailed conversation with us and we helped you as much as we could without charging you a penny for that. You even wanted a precise treatment plan on the phone which we said could only be possible after we examined a few things. You already knew about your Consultation Fees (which is the only payment you ever made to us). If you thought even our Consultation Fees was high, you could have chosen to not visit us. 
And the clinic cleanliness bit of course appears like an afterthought. No one in all these years of our practice has ever had anything adverse to say on that account. We only hope you are fair and honest in your assessment. God Bless and Stay Healthy!",2020-09-15T17:49:58+0000,Dr. Sony Mishra
