I know doctor I was a hard patient to treat on but trust me back home my dentist in California used to just avoid treating me thereby making me further suffer and I was all through paranoid with dentists. Thanks for making the difference.\nI mean it really worked so well here that I can't thank you so easily. At one time in my life I thought I would die of dental problems as I was on medicines heavily and never use to be able to cooperate with my dentist. \n\nBeing a frequent traveller I can say I have been to more dentists than restaurants in my life. Out of list of 27 dentists(according to list with my secretary from 15 countries )All used to blame me as a bad patient.\nI was reffered to your clinic by concierge of Hotel ITC Maurya (probably well known hotel in new delhi). The person at help desk was so sure about you that he said that's one of the best thing he can offer me in New Delhi.\nMy wife specially flew from The United States once she came to know that my treatment is going on with you people as it was unbelievable thing for her. She supported me in making it worth and Shaped it to suit me. \nIn the end I would surely like to thanks your wife Dr Poonam Nagpal as most competent lady dentist I came across. Never in hurry but always makes thing according to patient on chair. I still remember I took good long hours just to take my first anaesthesia from her but that changed me totally and turned me cooperative. \nHonestly your dental office is at par with standards(what I was able to see) of clinic in States, just the difference is that dentists out there act very pricey and you people behave very humble which is important  and is probably your best quality. \nI promise to do best of arrangements for you if you plan to visit us in Beverly Hills anytime.

For these obvious reasons I thought that I can couple my family trip with opportunity to get my Dental problems fixed. Indeed I ended up selecting Dr Sourabh for my treatment and in long run today i feel it was a beautiful decision. \r\n* Very good and updated clinic.\r\n*Dentist was able to converse with my routine dentist in states and was infact able to convince him for his decision for treatment. Though my family dentist is far more older than Dr Nagpal, but he acknowledged that I am in safe hands as work once evaluated after completion was flawless.\r\n* During my treatment appointment I came across patients of various nationalities, atleast 14-16 who were utterly satsified on previous occasions and were regular patients at Matrix clinic. This further gave me confidence,as for me Dr Sourabh was very young.\r\n*My motive was to get good friendly treatment as overtime I felt that my dentist in Chicago was over charging unnecessarily and was still not giving sufficient time and attention too,probably bcoz of over occupancy. But I wasn't in any crisis situation while being on Dr Nagpal's dental office. Infact I was more comfortable than ever.\r\n*Brands of implants and materials were used as per my satisfaction and I opted for best availables.\r\n*Punctuality in completing and committing appointments was very impressive as even after some bottle necks doc was able to complete my treatment in time frame as was committed.\r\n*Cost structuring was quite transparent as same was discussed in email too and was on website clearly displayed.\r\n*All in total I was able to get best and according to my satisfaction. \r\n*My recommendation for Dr Sourabh Nagpal  is based on my personal experience, follow up of months and a complete check up by my specialist back home. So that's make me feel that my views can be of help to other patients of Dr Nagpal. \r\nRegards\r\nPaul M.",

I must say he is artist scientifically designing smiles. I atleast saw around 10-12 patients walking out with a all together new smile. Initially I was reluctant but when I met so many happy females of my age group I somehow got convinced but was scared till last appointment but more or less it was as if something was destined and Dr NAGPAL was well aware of what results can be attained. So it was his skill which made all this possible. You will hardly find anybody who got such a treatment done but it was nice that I got good smile that too without braces and best thing I liked was that doc gave me smile exactly resembling the pic that I showed him from a magazine. All in all I am delighted and excited and all credits and salutes to this marvelous dentist couple Dr Sourabh Nagpal and Dr Poonam Nagpal. To get such a thing before your wedding photography is a dream for every gal like me but doc made it true and easy for me. #SmileDesign at its best I would quote.",

Now you will ask how much you will have to dish out for that and he will display a chart that says an X amount. And you will think that's how much I am spending for it. But wait, that's only the token amount. He will keep bringing additional charges for various stages of the root canal process. For instance after 3 visits, he will say something like\" now i will have to insert a fiber support to strengthen your teeth. That will cost an additional 6K or something\". If that was a part of the root canal process that should already have been included in the bill amount.\n\nAnyways, now is the time for crowning. Either you opt for a metallic crown or a ceramic. I opted for the ceramic one with a 5 years warranty. But when it was time for me to get the crown fitted, he said \"the 5 year cover has recently become invalid so I have made the 10 year plan for you. This will cost you 3K extra\". I didn't make much of a fuss about it back then because it was already at the back of my mind to go for the years plan. But still I felt like he should have at least given me a prior update and taken my consent before going ahead with the new plan. What if I wasn't willing to dish away the additional charges? \n\nNow after almost 3 months I still feel although very minimal but still some kind of a sensitivity in my crowning area. I also opted for deep cleaning. Even here he chose to give a miss to those areas where it's not visible. And now as I got a reminder from Matrix Dental Clinic via Practo for a routine/follow up check I decided to review the place and inform that I don't know about others but \"I am finding another dentist for my future visits\". \n\nI am still giving it a 2 rather than 1 star because the receptionist was a \ncooperative and sensible lady.\n",

Surely I can stand in front of your Clinic for a month to tell everyone that this is most worthy dentist in Delhi. \r\nEarlier I thought you are young and must be less experienced \"but sir your abilities can give you success in any work atleast in dentistry, believe me I rate you better than any specialist I met in my life . \r\nRoot canaling, crowning and what all you touched is now a master piece. \r\nI conceptualised and you did it, that's what I can say. \r\n# I searched you through my online search and got you through Practo and it was ritely guided. \r\n##Your Clinic and staff and doctors all are very good.\r\nProbably this is the reason why your all patients praise a lot.

Trust us as in our Swiss Embassy staff we get trusted doctors list and your name is unanimously opted as single dentist who helped many of us through services from your Matrix Clinic. Recently many staff members shifted back home but new one poured in to be equally comfortable with you and your wife Dr Nagpal Poonam. Clean and hygienic Clinic like you made was preference for us and more importantly good treatment. Your website also helped us with cost estimates and everything done suited everyone of us. We thanks you from core of our heart. Frankly it was very difficult when I sat first on your chair, but that day and today I am a big fan of your Clinic. My reason for being scared on day one was my visit at a new dentist all together in a new country and what not, but you prooved me wrong and handled everything professionaly. Big thanks.",

It has definitely changed the way I look,speak, eat and smile. I was suffering from tooth problem since my childhood and by the age of 40 I was in bad shape. Though such a condition is common in Riyadh but I wanted better life and searched on net about different places in world to get good dental treatment. Places shortlisted included Dr Nagpal's place also in New Delhi India. After my enquiry one translator was arranged to interact with me from a good university who served great. I came to India twice for first stage and second stage at a gap of around 5 months. \nTreatment I opted was All on Four Dental Implants \n\nIn my first visit all teeth were removed and replaced with implants and temporary teeth over it. Surgery went comfortably and gave me ease of eating though appearance was just ok.\nIn my second visit temporary teeth were replaced with permanent Zirconia teeth. Helped me in getting my dream Hollywood Smile.\n\nAll my treatment is ok and satisfactory. Dr Nagpal is not only good implanologist but also very understanding and caring. I wish all doctors treat there patients like Dr Sourabh Nagpal.\n\nRegards \n\nKhaled IbrahimG",

Doctor gave us a healing time of 15 days and that was a blessing. No bleeding nothing .After 15 days he placed the temporary prosthesis and we're all good for next 4 months till our permanent prosthesis will be placed. \nAll in all i recommend this clinic and specially Dr. Saurabh.

I know doctor I was a hard patient to treat on but trust me back home my dentist in California used to just avoid treating me thereby making me further suffer and I was all through paranoid with dentists. Thanks for making the difference.\nI mean it really worked so well here that I can't thank you so easily. At one time in my life I thought I would die of dental problems as I was on medicines heavily and never use to be able to cooperate with my dentist. \n\nBeing a frequent traveller I can say I have been to more dentists than restaurants in my life. Out of list of 27 dentists(according to list with my secretary from 15 countries )All used to blame me as a bad patient.\nI was reffered to your clinic by concierge of Hotel ITC Maurya (probably well known hotel in new delhi). The person at help desk was so sure about you that he said that's one of the best thing he can offer me in New Delhi.\nMy wife specially flew from The United States once she came to know that my treatment is going on with you people as it was unbelievable thing for her. She supported me in making it worth and Shaped it to suit me. \nIn the end I would surely like to thanks your wife Dr Poonam Nagpal as most competent lady dentist I came across. Never in hurry but always makes thing according to patient on chair. I still remember I took good long hours just to take my first anaesthesia from her but that changed me totally and turned me cooperative. \nHonestly your dental office is at par with standards(what I was able to see) of clinic in States, just the difference is that dentists out there act very pricey and you people behave very humble which is important  and is probably your best quality. \nI promise to do best of arrangements for you if you plan to visit us in Beverly Hills anytime.

For these obvious reasons I thought that I can couple my family trip with opportunity to get my Dental problems fixed. Indeed I ended up selecting Dr Sourabh for my treatment and in long run today i feel it was a beautiful decision. \r\n* Very good and updated clinic.\r\n*Dentist was able to converse with my routine dentist in states and was infact able to convince him for his decision for treatment. Though my family dentist is far more older than Dr Nagpal, but he acknowledged that I am in safe hands as work once evaluated after completion was flawless.\r\n* During my treatment appointment I came across patients of various nationalities, atleast 14-16 who were utterly satsified on previous occasions and were regular patients at Matrix clinic. This further gave me confidence,as for me Dr Sourabh was very young.\r\n*My motive was to get good friendly treatment as overtime I felt that my dentist in Chicago was over charging unnecessarily and was still not giving sufficient time and attention too,probably bcoz of over occupancy. But I wasn't in any crisis situation while being on Dr Nagpal's dental office. Infact I was more comfortable than ever.\r\n*Brands of implants and materials were used as per my satisfaction and I opted for best availables.\r\n*Punctuality in completing and committing appointments was very impressive as even after some bottle necks doc was able to complete my treatment in time frame as was committed.\r\n*Cost structuring was quite transparent as same was discussed in email too and was on website clearly displayed.\r\n*All in total I was able to get best and according to my satisfaction. \r\n*My recommendation for Dr Sourabh Nagpal  is based on my personal experience, follow up of months and a complete check up by my specialist back home. So that's make me feel that my views can be of help to other patients of Dr Nagpal. \r\nRegards\r\nPaul M.",

I must say he is artist scientifically designing smiles. I atleast saw around 10-12 patients walking out with a all together new smile. Initially I was reluctant but when I met so many happy females of my age group I somehow got convinced but was scared till last appointment but more or less it was as if something was destined and Dr NAGPAL was well aware of what results can be attained. So it was his skill which made all this possible. You will hardly find anybody who got such a treatment done but it was nice that I got good smile that too without braces and best thing I liked was that doc gave me smile exactly resembling the pic that I showed him from a magazine. All in all I am delighted and excited and all credits and salutes to this marvelous dentist couple Dr Sourabh Nagpal and Dr Poonam Nagpal. To get such a thing before your wedding photography is a dream for every gal like me but doc made it true and easy for me. #SmileDesign at its best I would quote.",

Now you will ask how much you will have to dish out for that and he will display a chart that says an X amount. And you will think that's how much I am spending for it. But wait, that's only the token amount. He will keep bringing additional charges for various stages of the root canal process. For instance after 3 visits, he will say something like\" now i will have to insert a fiber support to strengthen your teeth. That will cost an additional 6K or something\". If that was a part of the root canal process that should already have been included in the bill amount.\n\nAnyways, now is the time for crowning. Either you opt for a metallic crown or a ceramic. I opted for the ceramic one with a 5 years warranty. But when it was time for me to get the crown fitted, he said \"the 5 year cover has recently become invalid so I have made the 10 year plan for you. This will cost you 3K extra\". I didn't make much of a fuss about it back then because it was already at the back of my mind to go for the years plan. But still I felt like he should have at least given me a prior update and taken my consent before going ahead with the new plan. What if I wasn't willing to dish away the additional charges? \n\nNow after almost 3 months I still feel although very minimal but still some kind of a sensitivity in my crowning area. I also opted for deep cleaning. Even here he chose to give a miss to those areas where it's not visible. And now as I got a reminder from Matrix Dental Clinic via Practo for a routine/follow up check I decided to review the place and inform that I don't know about others but \"I am finding another dentist for my future visits\". \n\nI am still giving it a 2 rather than 1 star because the receptionist was a \ncooperative and sensible lady.\n",

Trust us as in our Swiss Embassy staff we get trusted doctors list and your name is unanimously opted as single dentist who helped many of us through services from your Matrix Clinic. Recently many staff members shifted back home but new one poured in to be equally comfortable with you and your wife Dr Nagpal Poonam. Clean and hygienic Clinic like you made was preference for us and more importantly good treatment. Your website also helped us with cost estimates and everything done suited everyone of us. We thanks you from core of our heart. Frankly it was very difficult when I sat first on your chair, but that day and today I am a big fan of your Clinic. My reason for being scared on day one was my visit at a new dentist all together in a new country and what not, but you prooved me wrong and handled everything professionaly. Big thanks.",

It has definitely changed the way I look,speak, eat and smile. I was suffering from tooth problem since my childhood and by the age of 40 I was in bad shape. Though such a condition is common in Riyadh but I wanted better life and searched on net about different places in world to get good dental treatment. Places shortlisted included Dr Nagpal's place also in New Delhi India. After my enquiry one translator was arranged to interact with me from a good university who served great. I came to India twice for first stage and second stage at a gap of around 5 months. \nTreatment I opted was All on Four Dental Implants \n\nIn my first visit all teeth were removed and replaced with implants and temporary teeth over it. Surgery went comfortably and gave me ease of eating though appearance was just ok.\nIn my second visit temporary teeth were replaced with permanent Zirconia teeth. Helped me in getting my dream Hollywood Smile.\n\nAll my treatment is ok and satisfactory. Dr Nagpal is not only good implanologist but also very understanding and caring. I wish all doctors treat there patients like Dr Sourabh Nagpal.\n\nRegards \n\nKhaled IbrahimG",

He told us to go for All-On-4. The tooth extraction and dental implant placement went very very smoothly. There was no major pain / complications as such. Doctor gave us a healing time of 15 days and that was a blessing. No bleeding nothing .After 15 days he placed the temporary prosthesis and we're all good for next 4 months till our permanent prosthesis will be placed. \nAll in all i recommend this clinic and specially Dr. Saurabh. The most helpful,calm,down-to-earth,patient and well communicating doctor.",

But his energy revealed it all and in a short time my front tooth gap problem was all solved to best of what I can not ever imagine in my life. Veneers were too perfect and gave life like appearance.\n\nAll through the process both doctors Dr Sourabh and Dr Poonam were conversing and explaining me the process as made it look simpler and easier.\nAll my worries were answered properly and thanks Practo for suggesting me such a nice dentist.\n",

She committed to call me about appointment with their visiting doctor who would have done the extraction for me but she never followed up or bothered mailing me. she was unable to comprehend my situation even. I have no idea what is she doing there?!! I never got a chance to experience their services but Dr Priyanka is certainly bad for their 'business'.  ",

I mean I wonder why I wasn't suggested such treatment earlier. It was at 11 hour only we went on to go with this treatment and my biggest worry was my gaps in smile that would come in wedding pics. Now I won't be conscious at all. Three cheers and hats off to Nagpal's Clinic for such wonderful result and work done with perfection.",

After the procedure, the team explained to me post-care and medication in detail. They even sent me post-care instructions on whatsapp which is pretty neat. Overall, a great facility with very professional staff and a great doctor. Definitely and highly recommended. ",

Dr Nagpal is very nice and helpful and has patient centred approach which I really appreciated. Also my wife is now getting dental treatment as a response to my treatment experience. As far as dental clinic is concerned, I can comment its most beautiful clinic ever visited by me in my life and that's a big compliment as I am a frequent traveller and visited places and clinics worldwide. Praise for Dr Sourabh won't end if don't mention his personal support he extended to take my calls even in the middle of night while I was travelling overseas and had a dental emergency, thankfully I was advised medicines and I was able to complete my project without any problem. As for a traveller to get dental treatment urgently in London is a big big trouble.",

Since then I've been getting all my dental treatment too from Dr. Nagpal. Although I live in a different city in India, I travel to Delhi specifically to see Dr. Nagpal to get all dental treatment as his treatment is reliably good. He takes the time to explain the details of what he plans to do and why he is doing it. He also ensures the comfort of his patients at all times and is genuinely concerned about his patients. Last time I had come for a wisdom tooth extraction and it was done with absolutely zero pain (both during and after the procedure). Therefore, this time when I had to get my wisdom teeth removed on the other side, Dr. Nagpal's clinic was the obvious choice. This time I had to get two wisdom teeth removed and one was very close to the nerve. But the procedure was done without a hitch in about 45 minutes. Dr, Nagpal gave excellent and detailed advice on what to do during the recovery period. It has been 3 weeks since the procedure. I felt no pain in the whole recovery period and I am very happy with the results. If I have any dental problems there is no place I'd rather go than Dr. Nagpal's clinic and I would strongly recommend him to friends and family. ",

My all appointments started well in time. Initially in my first few appointments  i was a little bit confused and tensed obviously as i always used to avoid dentists and now i was helplessly confronting them for my own good and also for my carelesness i was in pain and suffering, but Dr Sourabh nagpal and Dr Poonam nagpal made me really comfortable everytime . Both doctors were engaging me in talks and discussions throughout the procedure with a smiling face. Doc never showed any hurry for other patients which i feel was most pleasing part. I went through RCT(as people call it) process of so called root canals and dental implant surgery and crowns and smile correction but frankly none was difficult.I must say that all my confidence was result of good handling and nice convincing from nagpal couple and resultantly i am the benefeciary. Thanks to all of you. I can SMILE, EAT, PLAY and PRAY HAPPILY. \n",

Let me tell you I searched a lot of dentists and showed my teeth to at least five here in India, but you are the only one whom I felt is to go ahead with. Your approach was very positive unlike other dentists in south delhi area who were scaring me for my problem so as to make me panic. I suppose in such a young age you got the magic/healing conversation therapy. Today after my treatment is over, I am beyond expectations and truly devoted to you to become dentist for rest of my life, no matter where I am in world. Thanks a million times.",

We are your fan for what you are as a human being and as our dentist. My parents put up in Mumbai and I being in Delhi, but they always turn up here to ensure that you only treat them for dental worries.

When i entered his clinic I thought doc would be a busy person and will hardly give me time and that anyways wasn't my issue I just wanted good treatment from a thorough professional hand so that I don't have to repent and repay for my treatment in future and obviously minimal pain in all this. But Sourabh Nagpal is in real sense is none less than a entrepreneur with lots of energy to talk and work and educated me more and more about my problem. Till date I never felt that a dentist can be of this type and nature also. My previous dental Doctor used to just start work and I used to keep thinking how long and what all. But story was totally different here. And this behaviour changed my outlook towards getting treatment done rather than to run away. \r\nMy final words to quote that I took Practo as Pandora Box and in that I was able to shortlist and found Dr Sourabh Nagpal an extremely proficient personality whom I will refer to lots of family and frenz and whosoever in need of dentist.\r\n",

I had come here for Dental implants. I imagined that dental implant is a painful procedure. But Dr Praful Bali did all the implants in such a great and painless way. All the other most important treatments were done by the best Dr Saurabh Nagpal. Dr Nagpal is really the best and most experienced in his field. So amiable, so frank and so motivating he is. I was feeling as if my own friend is doing my treatment. Now I have regained my dental health back. I would recommend everyone to get your dental treatment done here. You will never be upset.\nLastly one thing I would rhyme -\nLooking for best treatment in dental ?\nThen go to Dr Saurabh Nagpal.",

If I compare my cost of treatment with only good available hospital in vasant kunj which I don't want to name then I surely saved half of my money by getting treatment done at Matrix Clinic and not even a single complaint from my side to point at. Whether it be dentist or their cost or reception people or hygiene. I strongly advice people reading this review that if you are searching a dentist in delhi or not satisfied with previous one, then you must meet Dr Nagpal for your problem.",

Infact while writing this review you crossed limits and that\u2019s why it is partially removed by Practo. Some patients come to review a dentist and some come for treatment.

I never feel much pain during complete treatment, my last experience when I visit any other dental care.  where I feel much pain and overall their treatment and equipment also not modernized, then I go through Google where i search best dentist detail meant where I get many options but i go through rating & previous feed back after then i visit best dentist MATRIX DENTAL & SKIN LOUNGE in Delhi. It was really great experience with Doctor & staff. And complete treatment cost is not much more if we look around and how they treat well then we will found then amount is not enough. So I defiantly recommended all my family, friends and colleagues, only visit MATRIX DENTAL no any where. Lastly I am thankful of Doctors and also staff they treat me very well.\\n                                                                  JAI HIND!\\n                                                                   Tanzin Gafelp",

So Dr Sourabh is our SOS and while my treatment was on he proved to be more than efficient. To praise for the staff members I would thank them for last minute calls for reminders of appointment. Both Dr Poonam and Dr Sourabh are nice humans first and then doctors. I was allowed to pay my fee later as my card was not working. I can say its a clinic with personnel touch and care which is clearly visible with standards of hygiene and up gradations that I saw in Matrix dental which surely is a priority for at least students like us. #MatrixDental deserves five stars and a pat on back.",
