Only about 2- 3 years\u2019 ago did I first consult Dr. Ojha at the White Willow dental clinic in Saket; which clinic I had first visited solely in view of the fact that the same is literally right next to where I live. Ever since, I have been going to Dr. Ojha for most of my dental treatment; which is attributable to the following reasons:- \n\nFirstly, Dr. Ojha is that he takes the trouble to explain the issue at hand to his patient in detail; and thereafter, suggests a line of dental treatment only after giving his reasons for the same. \n\nSecondly, at no stage did Dr. Ojha ever refuse to answer, or even give half-hearted answers, to any of my queries re the proposed dental treatment. \n\nThirdly, Dr. Ojha does not hesitate to recommend all dental treatment which he may deem necessary; so that the issue is not only suitably dealt with, but also does not re-occur (even if that entails RCT and capping). \n\nFourthly, Dr. Ojha is well-qualified; in as much as he is an alumnus of Manipal in Karnataka. \n\nFifthly and lastly, Dr. Ojha\u2019s clinic is extremely clean; and has been that way even prior to the outbreak of \u2018COVID- 19\u2019. \n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend Dr. Ojha; and wish him all the best.

Each and every time that I have walked into this office I am met with a friendly and smiling face.\nFor as long as I can remember I have had anxiety when going to dental appointments, from the first time I stepped foot into white willow Dental I could tell that their atmosphere was different.  Dr.Prashant Ojha was gentle and discussed with me what products I should and shouldn't be using. From there he walked me through the treatment plan needed in order to get my teeth back to their former glory. My three appointments with Dr. Ojha to complete my treatment have all been painless and effective.\nYou are presented with the treatment plan and costs well in advance to your next appointment so there are never any surprises. I would recommend  white willow dental to anyone in the Delhi and near by area that is looking for a dentist.",

Only about 2- 3 years\u2019 ago did I first consult Dr. Ojha at the White Willow dental clinic in Saket; which clinic I had first visited solely in view of the fact that the same is literally right next to where I live. Ever since, I have been going to Dr. Ojha for most of my dental treatment; which is attributable to the following reasons:- \n\nFirstly, Dr. Ojha is that he takes the trouble to explain the issue at hand to his patient in detail; and thereafter, suggests a line of dental treatment only after giving his reasons for the same. \n\nSecondly, at no stage did Dr. Ojha ever refuse to answer, or even give half-hearted answers, to any of my queries re the proposed dental treatment. \n\nThirdly, Dr. Ojha does not hesitate to recommend all dental treatment which he may deem necessary; so that the issue is not only suitably dealt with, but also does not re-occur (even if that entails RCT and capping). \n\nFourthly, Dr. Ojha is well-qualified; in as much as he is an alumnus of Manipal in Karnataka. \n\nFifthly and lastly, Dr. Ojha\u2019s clinic is extremely clean; and has been that way even prior to the outbreak of \u2018COVID- 19\u2019. \n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend Dr. Ojha; and wish him all the best.

Each and every time that I have walked into this office I am met with a friendly and smiling face.\nFor as long as I can remember I have had anxiety when going to dental appointments, from the first time I stepped foot into white willow Dental I could tell that their atmosphere was different.  Dr.Prashant Ojha was gentle and discussed with me what products I should and shouldn't be using. From there he walked me through the treatment plan needed in order to get my teeth back to their former glory. My three appointments with Dr. Ojha to complete my treatment have all been painless and effective.\nYou are presented with the treatment plan and costs well in advance to your next appointment so there are never any surprises. I would recommend  white willow dental to anyone in the Delhi and near by area that is looking for a dentist.",

I said okay go ahead. After the process which didn't last long, maybe 10-15 minutes, he made a bill of 4700. I am a student and was extremely surprised. I guess I figured that if something is that expensive, he would tell me before he starts the procedure (it isn't really a huge clinic or hospital, so you don't expect extravagant costs). Well, till here I guess the mistake is on both my side and his. I should've asked the cost and he(knowing that I'm just a student) should've told. Coming on to the worse part, the treatment didn't really work. It's been like 8 months and I still feel sensitivity in those teeth only, the ones he fixed. And it's not like the problem reemerged, it never went away. It's just that I am extremely busy and stressed with exams, career, etc that I am ignoring it. Being an adult who still relies on her parents' money because I'm studying, I feel really bad for the 4700 Rs. I spent on it with no return at all. After months of procrastination and the discomfort in my teeth after eating an ice cream, I am writing my experience with this clinic.",

The other doctor informed that RCT was not performed but actually just the teeth is opened, cleaned and filled. He had also given reports along with x-rays. When my friend had gone back to Prashant Ojha's clinic, he accepted that RCT is not performed and asked my friend if she is intended to do the RCT now. My friend lost trust on this doctor and his procedure, she is still suffering from teeth related problems and consulting another doctor to cure herself.",
