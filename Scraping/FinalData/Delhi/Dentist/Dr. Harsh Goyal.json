I don't have words to commend their incredible great services, including their office attendants. Both docs take out their invaluable time to patiently explain the proposed procedure, Pros and cons of different procedures, Timeline including milestones thus aiding customer to propel toward right decision making. Their interpersonal & communication skills are astounding and most critical you will hear Gurbani in the background, which not only soothes the patient, while getting procedure done, but also conveys their character that they are God fearing and doing their kirt kamayi, adhering to simran, sangat, seva & shukrana. I strongly recommend their dental services to all. All the best",

The procedure itself was painless and efficient, and we couldn't be happier with the results.

                "review_text": "I visited Dr. Harsh Goyal while I was having severe pain in my molar. I have been visiting clove before but they told me that my condition is very complex and need to remove 4 molar tooth, including the wisdom tooth. My pain was in molar 6 and clove have a extra small molar 7. Since I didn\u2019t understand the logic of removing so many tooth, I visited another dentist which adviced the same. But later I visited Dr. Goyal who carefully examined the problem and realised my one tooth cracked because of some hard object and explained the most detailed tree diagram options.\nI was amazed to see the clarity and precision he was able to plot all possible options over a diagram.\nI was extremely clear in my mind and went ahead with the treatment.\nThankful to Dr Goyal, he saved my natural tooth and it required only wisdom tooth extraction which too he suggested as optional.\nDr. Goyal more than his experience, is a extreme great human being and is always so reachable during my whole process.",

But during our first meeting itself I liked the way he listened to our problems  one by one and answered all our queries \n confidently and satisfactorily. So, we decided to give a try and I'm happy that we did so. \nDoctor Harsh is a nice and friendly personality, always explains what kind of treatment he is going to perform and why, how it's going to feel and what we can expect. He always discusses various available options and how we should follow up at home and makes sure we are happy with the approach. \nI would definitely recommend people to visit Mr Goyal's clinic to get quality dental treatment.",

Then i visited some other Dentist and same thing happened again. After giving  anesthesia also i was in lot of pain when dr. Puts needle in my teeth. Then we went to dr. Goyals dental clinic and treatment was done by dr.  Harsh goyal. I can't even explain how smoothly my treatment went with dr. Harsh goyal.  He always gave  proper attention and time and listen carefully and calmly.\nI am highly impressed with the way the do the treatment.",

I am happy to see next generation doctors like harsh Goyal has joined his father (lots of respect to him). Like father son is also very talented , I think it comes in genes. I will always visit them. Best part is their honesty and true opinion , if something can be done then they will say yes otherwise they will say no. Once I took a German client to the clinic, even she was happy with the quality. Remember, Germans are known for quality\n\nRegards\nSujit",
