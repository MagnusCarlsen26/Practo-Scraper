                "review_text": "Let me just start by saying that I wouldn't travel for 45 kilometres if it weren't for Dr Aggarwal as my dentist. I wouldn't let anyone else remove my teeth (4 of them). \nI usually don't get convinced easily but when I met Dr Aggarwal, I knew I had to get my braces from him and him only. Oh how he explained the process, the science behind the treatment, answers to my doubts and anything and everything. \nI started with my treatment in Jan 2016 and to date I never had a problem with timings, appointment reschedules or the treatment itself. Well, except this one time because of a confusing text when Dr Aggarwal thought it was rude of me to say that I had to manage a lot of things to come to Delhi on a Sunday which the original appointment was for, unfortunately the receptionist didn't realise that she gave me an appointment on a Sunday. Genuine mistake, of course. But then we cleared the air nicely soon on my next visit.\n\nRegarding the treatment, in a nutshell I am super happy after I have gotten the braces off. My teeth are very well adjusted and I have no pain or discomfort whatsoever. I still wear my retainers. \n\nI went for 3M transparent braces. Treatment was super expensive, given the cost of braces, retainers and 2 teeth crowns. Again I went for the top quality ones (with everything). My treatment did cost a lot (around 80,000 Rs) but I do have to say this \"it was worth every penny.\" \n\nGetting braces will hurt like hell, sleepless nights, sickening health because of not being able to eat most of the times, difficulties in talking and other unwanted associated problems that you get with this package. However, despite a long battle of 1.5 years it will always be worth your efforts to get healthy teeth and gums. I tend to think that it's okay to be uncomfortable for all this time than regretting it later in life that we should have gotten it done when we could. Getting your teeth adjusted is much better than getting them pulled out of your mouth. Originals are the best (I hope everyone would agree).\n\nI do recommend (sorry STRONGLY recommend, can't emphasise this enough) Dr Aggarwal if you need a dental treatment. AND...If you want to understand the treatment well, would like to go to a well-equipped, hygienic clinic, looking for a dentist who would NOT simply treat you for anything to make some money, want your dentist to be polite and supportive, and of all importance...for ***** results possible, go to Delhi Dental Cosmetics. And hey, it's walking distance from GTB Nagar Metro Station...is it great or what?!\n\nI respect Dr Aggarwal as a dentist. Not just for MY treatment. \n\nPS: No one paid me or gave me any discount to write all this. ;) I am a writer (of sorts), sorry you had to deal with this (reading a long text), yet I hope this addresses (articulates rather) all possible things you needed to know about the clinic and of course, Dr Animesh Aggarwal. I thank you for your time.",

Even though I was sure I wanted to get my dental braces for fixing my teeth at the age of 24, I still had some doubts if this was the right age to get it done and if this really was the right choice to make. \n\nAfter meeting the doctor, all my concerns and queries were resolved and he ensured me that getting the braces even at this age was the right call. He explained the treatment to me in a really nice way and he made me feel really comfortable about the whole experience. \n\nI had time constraints and I wanted to get done with the treatment as soon as possible. In any normal case, the treatment he suggested would have taken 12-15 months for the completion but I only had 6 months in Delhi to spare and I needed the results in a very short time period. He did a full diagnosis to figure out if he could get this whole process done in this short period of time and after going through the full diagnosis he assured me that he would fix my teeth within 6 months. \n\nThe treatment started the very next day and Dr Neha was given the charge of taking care of my dental treatment. She kept my comfort as a priority during the whole treatment and made sure I do not go through any discomfort during the process. She is highly experienced in the field of Orthodontics and I would recommend her any day for anyone looking forward to getting their teeth fixed.  \n\nAfter a brief period of 6 months, my braces were off and I was able to take a look at my well-alligned teeth. I am highly impressed by the end results and would like to thank Dr Animesh and Dr Neha for their astonishing work. \n\n",

So he suggested me not to get re-RCT done and just go with implantation of tooth.\n\nI visited 3-4 doctors more to have their opinion on the same and I got mixed reviews where some of them told that my tooth will not be able to survive and i should go with implantation procedure while the others suggested me me go with re-RCT.\n\nMeanwhile, someone suggested to me visit Dr Animesh\u2019s clinic as well..I went to his clinic and met him.. First impression say much and working in a clean environment is essential for every medical staff...The clinic is very neat and clean everytime i have visited the clinic for my treatment.\n\nHe checked my tooth thoroughly and at first instance he told me your tooth will survive and there\u2019s no need for implantation. He checked my tooth with OPG report and showed me the infected area and explained me everything in detail..I felt extremely satisfied with his advice at each step he gave and started treatment with him. \nNow i have got my re RCT done and my swelling has gone and tooth is fine.\n\nAll thanks to Dr Animesh for his sincere efforts and cost effective treatment.",

My teeth were a total mess, a criss-cross jungle inside my mouth had made me super self conscious. I was 11 years old, in 2007 when I had got my first set of braces in Nagpur, an attempt which went horribly bad. I had again gotten braces, in 2009, this time from a reputed clinic in Bhopal, my subsequent base change to Delhi in 2011 due to which there could not be a proper closure to my treatment, and my insincerity in wearing my retainers had led to a huge gap formation in between my two front teeth by 2014, I got new retainers made by Medanta, Gurgaon but overall the teeth never went back to being straight, nice and gap-less. I had started feeling bad about the way my teeth had started looking, tilted to the sides with wide gaps! I was frantically looking for good Orthodontists in Delhi in July 2017, that I came across Dr. Animesh Agarwal, I read a few reviews and quickly booked an appointment. The office was good in coordinating and the next day I was in his clinic. Alongside being cordial and humble, he is excellent in what he does. \nI remember explaining my case history to him, he was all ears and made me really comfortable. An X-ray later, he was quick to explain my parents what had gone wrong and how can it be rectified.\nI remember getting braces that day itself (for the third time in my life). Time has passed by quickly and my teeth are almost straight now (again, and hopefully will always remain so!). I'll be getting my braces off soon. ****** ******* ******* ** *********** *** ** *** **** ******** ** *** ******** considering that he was also the official dentist of the President of India, Mr Pranab Mukherjee. I am absolutely grateful that I got an opportunity to get my treatment done by him. Thank you! ",

I wouldn't let anyone else remove my teeth (4 of them). \nI usually don't get convinced easily but when I met Dr Aggarwal, I knew I had to get my braces from him and him only. Oh how he explained the process, the science behind the treatment, answers to my doubts and anything and everything. \nI started with my treatment in Jan 2016 and to date I never had a problem with timings, appointment reschedules or the treatment itself. Well, except this one time because of a confusing text when Dr Aggarwal thought it was rude of me to say that I had to manage a lot of things to come to Delhi on a Sunday which the original appointment was for, unfortunately the receptionist didn't realise that she gave me an appointment on a Sunday. Genuine mistake, of course. But then we cleared the air nicely soon on my next visit.\n\nRegarding the treatment, in a nutshell I am super happy after I have gotten the braces off. My teeth are very well adjusted and I have no pain or discomfort whatsoever. I still wear my retainers. \n\nI went for 3M transparent braces. Treatment was super expensive, given the cost of braces, retainers and 2 teeth crowns. Again I went for the top quality ones (with everything). My treatment did cost a lot (around 80,000 Rs) but I do have to say this \"it was worth every penny.\" \n\nGetting braces will hurt like hell, sleepless nights, sickening health because of not being able to eat most of the times, difficulties in talking and other unwanted associated problems that you get with this package. However, despite a long battle of 1.5 years it will always be worth your efforts to get healthy teeth and gums. I tend to think that it's okay to be uncomfortable for all this time than regretting it later in life that we should have gotten it done when we could. Getting your teeth adjusted is much better than getting them pulled out of your mouth. Originals are the best (I hope everyone would agree).\n\nI do recommend (sorry STRONGLY recommend, can't emphasise this enough) Dr Aggarwal if you need a dental treatment. AND...If you want to understand the treatment well, would like to go to a well-equipped, hygienic clinic, looking for a dentist who would NOT simply treat you for anything to make some money, want your dentist to be polite and supportive, and of all importance...for ***** results possible, go to Delhi Dental Cosmetics. And hey, it's walking distance from GTB Nagar Metro Station...is it great or what?!\n\nI respect Dr Aggarwal as a dentist. Not just for MY treatment. \n\nPS: No one paid me or gave me any discount to write all this. ;) I am a writer (of sorts), sorry you had to deal with this (reading a long text), yet I hope this addresses (articulates rather) all possible things you needed to know about the clinic and of course, Dr Animesh Aggarwal. I thank you for your time.",

Even though I was sure I wanted to get my dental braces for fixing my teeth at the age of 24, I still had some doubts if this was the right age to get it done and if this really was the right choice to make. \n\nAfter meeting the doctor, all my concerns and queries were resolved and he ensured me that getting the braces even at this age was the right call. He explained the treatment to me in a really nice way and he made me feel really comfortable about the whole experience. \n\nI had time constraints and I wanted to get done with the treatment as soon as possible. In any normal case, the treatment he suggested would have taken 12-15 months for the completion but I only had 6 months in Delhi to spare and I needed the results in a very short time period. He did a full diagnosis to figure out if he could get this whole process done in this short period of time and after going through the full diagnosis he assured me that he would fix my teeth within 6 months. \n\nThe treatment started the very next day and Dr Neha was given the charge of taking care of my dental treatment. She kept my comfort as a priority during the whole treatment and made sure I do not go through any discomfort during the process. She is highly experienced in the field of Orthodontics and I would recommend her any day for anyone looking forward to getting their teeth fixed.  \n\nAfter a brief period of 6 months, my braces were off and I was able to take a look at my well-alligned teeth. I am highly impressed by the end results and would like to thank Dr Animesh and Dr Neha for their astonishing work. \n\n",

So he suggested me not to get re-RCT done and just go with implantation of tooth.\n\nI visited 3-4 doctors more to have their opinion on the same and I got mixed reviews where some of them told that my tooth will not be able to survive and i should go with implantation procedure while the others suggested me me go with re-RCT.\n\nMeanwhile, someone suggested to me visit Dr Animesh\u2019s clinic as well..I went to his clinic and met him.. First impression say much and working in a clean environment is essential for every medical staff...The clinic is very neat and clean everytime i have visited the clinic for my treatment.\n\nHe checked my tooth thoroughly and at first instance he told me your tooth will survive and there\u2019s no need for implantation. He checked my tooth with OPG report and showed me the infected area and explained me everything in detail..I felt extremely satisfied with his advice at each step he gave and started treatment with him. \nNow i have got my re RCT done and my swelling has gone and tooth is fine.\n\nAll thanks to Dr Animesh for his sincere efforts and cost effective treatment.",

My teeth were a total mess, a criss-cross jungle inside my mouth had made me super self conscious. I was 11 years old, in 2007 when I had got my first set of braces in Nagpur, an attempt which went horribly bad. I had again gotten braces, in 2009, this time from a reputed clinic in Bhopal, my subsequent base change to Delhi in 2011 due to which there could not be a proper closure to my treatment, and my insincerity in wearing my retainers had led to a huge gap formation in between my two front teeth by 2014, I got new retainers made by Medanta, Gurgaon but overall the teeth never went back to being straight, nice and gap-less. I had started feeling bad about the way my teeth had started looking, tilted to the sides with wide gaps! I was frantically looking for good Orthodontists in Delhi in July 2017, that I came across Dr. Animesh Agarwal, I read a few reviews and quickly booked an appointment. The office was good in coordinating and the next day I was in his clinic. Alongside being cordial and humble, he is excellent in what he does. \nI remember explaining my case history to him, he was all ears and made me really comfortable. An X-ray later, he was quick to explain my parents what had gone wrong and how can it be rectified.\nI remember getting braces that day itself (for the third time in my life). Time has passed by quickly and my teeth are almost straight now (again, and hopefully will always remain so!). I'll be getting my braces off soon. ****** ******* ******* ** *********** *** ** *** **** ******** ** *** ******** considering that he was also the official dentist of the President of India, Mr Pranab Mukherjee. I am absolutely grateful that I got an opportunity to get my treatment done by him. Thank you! ",

Came here last September with my problems as I would shy away from camera and wouldn\u2019t smile in front of people as I was always insecure about the way my teeth looked. After listening to my problems and examining the situation I was recommended invisalign and they changed my life. Being a college student, I wasn\u2019t very confident with the idea of braces, but invisalign are a type of aligners that works like braces but are invisible. After my invisalign treatment was complete, I still didn\u2019t like the shape of my teeth and colour and I was recommended veneers and I have never been happier. Veneers changed my life and I love the way my teeth look now. Never been this confident about the teeth and my smile. I would highly recommend anyone and everyone to come to Delhi dental cosmetics was all queries are resolved with the same day if not Ina minutes. *** ******* ******* ** *** **** ******* *** *** **** ** ****** ",

After treating that, he suggested I get orthodontic braces as my teeth needed some alignment. Dr. Animesh explained the various options for the treatment and after some thought I decided to go ahead with it. Since then I have been visiting every month and the service I have received is excellent. Appointments are given as per my convenience and I have never had to wait for a long time to be attended. Dr. Animesh is very professional and explained the treatment course thoroughly. Most importantly he has an excellent chairside manner and is very polite & friendly. So, even though it takes me over an hour to reach the clinic, it doesn't feel like a hassle and I am always at ease visiting the clinic. He is very approachable over the phone also in case of any issue regarding the treatment.\nThe braces part of the treatment is complete now and I'm very happy with the result.\nA lot of my family members visit Dr. Animesh for their teeth issues and I would recommend him to anyone looking for any kind of dental treatment.",

When I visited the clinic , I was greeted by the receptionist very well and had to hardly wait for my turn as the clinic was very professional and my consultation started as per the appointment. After the Oral Xray , I was informed that RCT needs to be done. Initially I was very apprehensive , However the Doctor clarified all my doubts about the treatment and assured that it will be a painless treatment and due to the latest technology , it will be done in one sitting. \nThe treatment was exactly what they had promised , and was done in one sitting. After procedure care , was explained in detail and was advised the Do's and Don'ts for the next 24hours. I followed exactly what the doctor had prescribed and After 2-3 days my Cap was fitted on my RCT Tooth. The Hygienic standard in the clinic is very good.\nIt has been a painless treatment and I thank the Doctors team at the clinic *** *** ********* ********* ***** *** ***** ** ***** ******* ***** *\n",

I must say he is an artist scientifically.\nWhen i entered his clinic, I just wanted good treatment from a professional hand so that I don't have to repent and repay for my treatment in future and obviously minimal pain in all this. But Animesh Agarwal is in real sense is none less than an artist with lots of energy to talk and work and educated me more and more about my problem. Till date I never felt that a dentist can be of this type and nature also.\nHis empathetic nature makes it so easy for a patient to feel comfortable and at ease in his capable hands. He is confident, ************* *** ******** and I believe it was truly due to these factors that I felt virtually no pain during or after my root canal treatment & tooth extraction. I had to get a wisdom tooth extracted surgically since the tooth was lodged under the jaw bone.  I had stitches inside my mouth and I could not believe that I didn\u2019t require taking any pain killer for not more than 2 days to deal with the pain (although he had recommended pain killers to ease the pain and discomfort).\nI strongly recommand him for dental problems.\nthank you so much doctor and wish you a good luck for your future.",

The best part of the treatment was that we became friends for ever,age differences  not withstanding.Undoubtedly the treatment was highly expensive as I opted for the best one.But it was worth that.I am sure we had one of the best Doctors-Patients relationship as I completely trusted them and religiously followed their sane instructions while they attentively listened to my obvious problems.One may have the resources to go for costly treatments,but that will not guarantee less pain unless trust deficit is bridged.I enjoyed my long treatment as I trusted my doctors and now I am enjoying all sorts of foods as much as I was enjoying when I had teeth problem, I am conditioned that way to enjoy life both in pain and pleasure.My best wishes for Dr.Animesh and his team.

For most of my life I had associated dental visits with anxiety, as well as the potential of pain if dental work was needed. From the first visit Dr. Animesh  and his staff were very compassionate, patient *** ************** It was the first time I was visually educated about my dental health through my X-rays and detailed photos of my teeth, as well as informed of the causes of my recurrent problems.\n\u201cI had many old fillings that needed to be replaced with crowns . The experience was pain-free, the staff exceptional and I was extremely pleased with the outcome. The next year I had some cosmetic work done on some of my front teeth with veneers. I was quite anxious at first about changing how I looked; however, I have been exceptionally pleased with my results! Not only did the veneers improve my smile, they helped me to smile with confidence..\n\u201cI learned that dental health is linked to your overall health. It was enlightening for me and I have passed on this knowledge to all of my patients. \n \u201cDr.Animesh  helped me take very good care of my teeth, as I didn\u2019t want them to deteriorate to the point where I needed more advanced and uncomfortable treatment. He encouraged me to get sealants for prevention of cavities, as well as veneers, which handled a chip on one of my front teeth from a childhood accident, and gave me a uniform and beautiful smile.\n\u201cThere is a family atmosphere at the practice; the staff is very professional and friendly, and always remembers you. I love the fact that they are always learning new techniques and that they stay up-to-date on the latest technology. It is a pleasure being a patient of Dr. Animesh Agarwal.\n \u201cThe end results of my visit were a great smile and the opportunity to enjoy all foods I love, once again. I highly recommend this practice to anyone *** ***** *** **** ** ****** ******\n",

I thank myself for choosing Dr. Animesh as my dentist who have just given me the desired comfort of speaking and eating and within a treatment period of 11 weeks and a few follow-ups.  I was a patient requiring complete denture after extraction of more than a dozen of remaining and paining teeth. The job was done excellently even being challenging since it also required alveoplasty surgery and further healing of gums. The credit goes only  to the team led by Dr. Animesh of Delhi Dental Cosmetics at Hudson Lane, Delhi. The services and cooperations which I experienced there are definitely recommendable. The charges of different procedures may be felt to be a little bit higher but the satisfaction which one can get there is more valuable in life than prices.\n\nThanks to Dr. Animesh, Dr. Manish and Dr. Shailendra and all staff of Delhi Dental Cosmetics.",

Very warm, comforting and compassionate in dealing with patients. Properly explained the entire treatment procedure to me and made sure that he understood my concerns. I felt it necessary and went ahead with the treatment. I recommend eating soft foods and drinking warm beverages after getting the braces. Traveling 150 Kms, waiting a whole year and spending money for beautiful teeth were worth it. My teeth are very well adjusted and I feel no discomfort. I wear my retainers still. I smile with confidence and I am very much happy with my smile now.\n\nThanks, Dr. Animesh for treating me as your own patient. I strongly recommend you to family and friends.",

I wanted to get braces as an adult and that is why I was extra cautious about the procedure and about the timeline of the treatment. The first visit to Dr.Animesh made me feel real confident about my decision and I was now ensured that my treatment was in the right hands. He listened to all my queries and then explained me the whole procedure in a very detailed manner while demonstrating the samples using the real case pictures. Dr. Animesh is really warm and is always ready to help with a big smile on his face. My braces were put on by Dr. Neha and she proceeded with my treatment with comfort as a priority. She is well versed in her field and she keeps you calm throughout the process. My experience with Dr. Neha was tremendous and I would love to recommend her to my friends and family for their dental treatments.  Dr. Animesh and Dr. Neha always were just a call away whenever I had any query or least amount of discomfort. I really am more than satisfied with the end result of the treatment and I cannot thank them enough for my new found smile.",

I was attended well on my appointment time .though not many patients were there at the time of my appointment but proper social distancing posters and other education posters pasted on the walls for education of patient . They themselves check all the parameters and explain everything to the patient .\n    Root canal completed in single sitting only and with proper use of rubber technology ( as explained to me by Dr animesh). \n   Procedure took total around 1 hour and I really appreciate the way everything was handled properly. Also the charges for root canal was genuine and not excessive priced taking in consideration the precautions. M glad my pain is gone now .\nI surely recommend everyone to visit DELHI DENTAL COSMETICS if you have any problems. ",

He took the time to thoroughly review the case background and properly examine my wife\u2019s teeth to understand our issues and concerns. Furthermore, he patiently answered any of our questions and explained all the treatment options available to us. As our appointment progressed, it became pretty clear that Dr. Agarwal and his colleagues are an outstanding team of expert dentists and orthodontist who put in tremendous effort to stay abreast with all latest technologies to offer you nothing but the best dental care in New Delhi. Once we decided to proceed, Dr. Agarwal promptly agreed to treat my wife himself to considerately save us another trip to the clinic even as he had what seemed like a pretty packed calendar that day. In summary, we are glad to report that Dr. Agarwal seems to have a solid grip over working with the patients both in and out of his dental chair. Thus, both of us would strongly recommend Delhi Dental Cosmetics to our family and friends in a heartbeat. Finally, all the best in your journey to achieve that perfect simile.",

Dr.Animesh was really patient and solved each of my query and thoroughly explained me the procedure so I finally decided to get my treatment done. I really like that they have a discussion with you,to explain why and how a procedure is done and not leave you in the dark. I also had to get 4 of my tooth extracted and I am really really scared of injections but the entire process of tooth extraction was so smooth that I did not feel any pain during or after the process. He made me feel really comfortable during the entire procedure.I am more than satisfied with the end result. My experience was really wonderful and I am really grateful to Dr.Animesh for his sincere effort.I strongly recommend this place to anyone with a dental problem.",

I found everyone so friendly and helpful that I have stayed ever since. I have been referring all my friends to this office and they all love it too.\n\n\u201cI had some bad experiences with previous dentists who were rough or heavy-handed. But ideally, you want to feel as comfortable as possible and Dr Animesh Agarwal always makes me feel comfortable with his calming and sweet manner.  I have a busy schedule, but that isn\u2019t a problem. The staff fit me in, work around my schedule and are flexible, which I appreciate.\n\n\u201cRecently I thought I needed to pull a molar, but was told I could save the tooth and got a porcelain cap in just 1 day . They make the whole setting so relaxed and not at all frightening. They numb you first before injecting and you never realize it happened. Even people who I sent in who had fear of needles said they didn\u2019t feel anything. They also keep you informed of the procedures and give you options, without any pressure. I live an hour away, but once you get that type of service you know it is worth the trip.\u201d",

I have had old experiences with doctors who used to scare that if I don't get a treatment done then and there, il suffer. But here, I was able to take time, think and experiment with an alternative. He does not push one towards removal or surgery etc. if it could be managed otherwise. I hope my feedback is helpful and also that everyone has a similar experience. Good day :)",

He always listens to the patient and takes time to explain every procedure that is required for the treatment. When I got my teeth treated for close bite, Dr. Animesh was very supportive and through while explaining the process. I always feel comfortable both by the pleasant environment of Delhi Dental Cosmetic and friendly behavior of the staffs.

I was actually taken care like a kid, because I was behaving like one not letting him start the initial treatment peacefully.

Two implants been done and than ceramic crowns been givin to me and am glad that they look exactly like natural teeth.thanks to dr agarwal and amazing cad cam technology that is available now a days .\nI am now not afraid of eating and chewing normally and it has been worth the wait and money to look normal again.

Since having dental implants I am able to smile properly  which is all thanks to Dr Animesh for his ***** *** dedication.  I have become more confident since having implants and only have one major regret which is that I should have done this years ago.\\u201d I am writing this to thank you so much for the very professional job done in fitting my dental implant. I expected to experience some pain and discomfort but was pleasantly surprised. Following the loss of a tooth near the front of my mouth and subsequently wearing a denture which I could not get on with, I feel like I have my life back again since having the dental implant and crown fitted. It is very comfortable and feels like one of my own teeth. I would thoroughly recommend this procedure to anyone.\\",

Obviously i was also scared , but you will be completely numb and you won't feel anything painful, just sounds and pressure. My after experience was perfect, I have no complaints. The numbing wore off and I felt absolutely fine like nothing had even been done. I am so relieved I did it and can guarantee it is better than having the whole tooth out. I encourage you to get it done as I now have absolutely no pain.also i got zirconia crowns done after that and it looks so natural.i am really thankful to Dr Animesh and his team for making me so comfortable and giving me courage to get this done.also clinic ambience is very nice and doctors are patient to listen to patient problems and not in hurry.will definitely  recommend him",

One thing about Dr. Aggarwal sir which makes me feel comfortable is that he listens to one's problem very patiently and silently and responds in the most appropriate way through his dental toolkits. His clinic is worth visiting, atleast once, for everyone who has any dental issues, whatsever.\nLots of good smiles:)",
