Dr Akansha is a very humble person and ensured that child is comfortable with her. As this was his first dentist visit / treatment I was lil skeptical initially. But the moment I met her, she explained about the problem and advised treatment accordingly. She ensured that she explains the problem in detail and answers all queries. She gave remarkable results for my son way before the speculates time. Her clinic follow up is way beyond your expectations. I am extremely happy with the results and would highly recommend Dr Akansha for any pediatric treatment.",
