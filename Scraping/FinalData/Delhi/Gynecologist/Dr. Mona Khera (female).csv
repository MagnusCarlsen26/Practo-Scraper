"Doctor friendliness,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,NO,"We visited Dr Mona Khera for my wife's gynae consultations, after my mother's wish as she was also operated by by Dr Mona 30 years back.
Though we read a negative review about her behaviour on practo but ignored it as we trusted her.
But unfortunately, all our expectations were shattered. As we reached her clinic in Inderpuri, first of all there was no space to park a bike, only I know how I parked my car.
As secondly, we took prior appointment but to our horror the review we read on practo was true. Even the clinic was empty but she kept us waiting for about 30 minutes.
Soon we got so furious, we stood up and left the place.
A doctor who cannot respect her patient is an insult to this noble profession.

Also, once I consulted for my wife's infection during COVID, at that time as well she was really rude.
Nevertheless, beware guys!!
