"Explanation of the health issue,",,0,0,YES,"Hello 
I need to share something 
I have paid online for my both of my appointments but for my last appointment which was on 22.4.2022 I by mistake booked video consultation instead of clinic consultation and I was completely unaware about that. When I reached clinic doctor told me that you are booked for video consultation I checked and she was right. So, I asked her what is the solution Mam, She said I will cancel this appointment from my end and I am writing that patient asked to cancel and you will get your money back from Practo and you need to pay here at my clinic. I said fine. She said that she cancelled it by mentioning that patient asked to cancel and as discussed I paid 700 at her clinic. But I never got my money back from Practo aslo the app is adoring for my feedback for video consultation.
Highly disappointed.
Please look into the matter and give my money back as son as possible.
Thank you
