And without any second thought I would recommend my family and friends to reach out to her incase they are in need.\n\nSecondly I would like to little verify the statement of one of reviews given by Ms. Prachi Tyagi who has written a feedback for Doctor -allow me to provide you small clarification here. I am the person you are referring in your review \u201cas friends\u201d- I am her patient and on 19 April , even though you were sitting there but I am sure you are not aware that I was already undergoing the procedure and went out for some time bound activity and I have very minimal time to action on the procedure and hence she allowed me inside her cabin- she was not entertaining us- it was the need of the hour and I appreciate your patience there. However I very clearly remember that she did speak to in the other cabin of her Clinic while I had some procedure requirement to rest . So let us be humble, understand doctor methodology of operating. I hope you are feeling better now. Take care and cheers \n\nThanks Dr Shalini for you being amazing Doctor and moreover amazing human being \n\nKeep growing in your career all the best",

One of our test did not come out as expected, and she was the only one pointing out that we should repeat the test, while no other Gynae questioned the test. The second test came out to be fine and finally we were relieved. The other doctor was only pushing us to go for a very expensive test.",

Once i consulted her, i was sure to continue as she heard me patiently and explained me everything in detail.\n\nThroughout my 9 months, she nvr called me ti her clinic unnecessarily. She was always calm and was available in emergency as well. No extra med or tests and thus it was very economical for us. \n\nEvn though she was stuck out of town during covid lockdown, she made sure shes available on call evrytime. Her moral support and virtual assistance helped me so much.\n\nBlessed with a baby boy Ruhaan at aakash hospital . Normal delivery. Thank you doctor. We stayed in delhi n didnt go to our hometown just because of our trust on you. N all of it was worth :)",

And then I pay for the urine and culture test, I was supposed to get the reports by today but have got nothing. The number is not reachable. I live in Gurgaon so I can't go back,I think they might have taken my 500 and they might never mail or WhatsApp me the reports which was pre decided. I feel like I have wasted money and I am scared that I won't ever get the reports. I hope they read this and help me out. ",

But none of the time we felt that she is hiding or missing something to understand our baby progress.\nThanks to our decision to go with Dr Shalini as she is very polite, friendly, helpful, experienced  and always think in favour of her patient.\nDuring the whole pregnancy check up she guided us  in such a manner that make it sense as she never told us to come in her clinic only.\nShe was ready to give my wife delivery at any hospital which suits us and save our money.\nShe is very transparent and flexible at her paitient request.\nCertainly, her guidance is value for money in terms of better result without any hesitation.\nOnce again a big thank to Dr Shalini by standing our side always and 5 star rating from my side.\nIf you have still some confusion then you may contact me on 9599820065 for more clarification.",
