                "review_text": "I was suffering from uncontrolled bp at the time of my pregnancy. My few friends suggested me to visit Dr mamta Goel for routine checkup. When I met her for the first time I made my mind to get admitted under her for my delivery. She forced me to go for normal delivery as I was really scared of the pain for labor pain. But all thanks to her efforts i had a normal delivery, a healthy baby boy. I can recommend this doctor to everyone. Thanks Dr mamta n team",
