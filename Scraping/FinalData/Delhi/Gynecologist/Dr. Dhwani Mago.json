However, my journey took a positive turn when my husband and I met Dr. Dhwani Mago. Her exceptional kindness, responsiveness, and empathy, coupled with her ability to calm the patient made the entire experience from day 1 to delivery incredibly comfortable. Despite facing some challenges in the first trimester, Dr. Dhwani Mago's expert handling and guidance, marked by a judicious use of tests and scans, contributed significantly to my overall satisfaction. I am genuinely delighted with the support and treatment received and wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Dhwani Mago.",

Doctor dhwani is an amazing doctor, she explains the situation nicely and patiently listens to problems. She elaborately explains positive and negative outcome of a disease.\nI visited her for my mother\u2019s post menopausal bleeding after visiting Apollo multiple times. she looked all the previous reports carefully and suggested us to go for biopsy. *** ****** ********* *** *********** ***** After biopsy, we were able to get the root cause of problem. My mom was diagnosed with endometrial cancer stage 1A and she along with oncologist surgeon did her radical hysterectomy.  Luckily we were able to identify it at early stage which is highly curable. \nShe stays available even on whatsapp and treats every patient with empathy. Must visit her if you have any gynaecology related issue. She will point you in the right direction and will save you a lot of trouble.",

I had took my wife there to visit Doc Dwani first time, and Honestly, we were very sacred of consulting a new doctor for a such a big problem my wife had.  we were not sure about how well this case will be taken care off. Because we had already met with some of the docs in past but they all were an average, in term of h\u00e0ndling first time patient and explaining issues with them. But I must tell you that we were so happy to see the way she (Doc) has explained everything to us, handled and treated my wife's case. It was so caring and affectionate. Even after post surgery Doc Dwani is so kind and helpful that, on 1 call or message, she is available to look after and consult with us. The surgey took place under her guidance was so good and my patient was taken so well cared off. Now my wife has that faith and confidence in Doc Dwani, that she has decided to take treatment from Dr Dwani  only for anything and everything in future.

I looked up on Internet and searched for best gynaecologist in Delhi NCR and Dr. Dhwani was one among the top. I read all the reviews carefully and to my shock I couldn\u2019t find a single negative review and now i know why. I hurriedly called and booked appointment on the same day. Doctor dhwani is an amazing doctor, she explains the situation nicely and patiently listens to problems. She elaborately explains positive and negative outcome of a disease.\nI visited her for my mother\u2019s post menopausal bleeding after visiting Apollo multiple times. she looked all the previous reports carefully and suggested us to go for biopsy. *** ****** ********* *** *********** ***** After biopsy, we were able to get the root cause of problem. My mom was diagnosed with endometrial cancer stage 1A and she along with oncologist surgeon did her radical hysterectomy.  Luckily we were able to identify it at early stage which is highly curable. \nShe stays available even on whatsapp and treats every patient with empathy. Must visit her if you have any gynaecology related issue. She will point you in the right direction and will save you a lot of trouble.",

I had took my wife there to visit Doc Dwani first time, and Honestly, we were very sacred of consulting a new doctor for a such a big problem my wife had.  we were not sure about how well this case will be taken care off. Because we had already met with some of the docs in past but they all were an average, in term of h\u00e0ndling first time patient and explaining issues with them. But I must tell you that we were so happy to see the way she (Doc) has explained everything to us, handled and treated my wife's case. It was so caring and affectionate. Even after post surgery Doc Dwani is so kind and helpful that, on 1 call or message, she is available to look after and consult with us. The surgey took place under her guidance was so good and my patient was taken so well cared off. Now my wife has that faith and confidence in Doc Dwani, that she has decided to take treatment from Dr Dwani  only for anything and everything in future.  Once Again Thanks a ton to Doctor Dwani Moga. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude42 \n\nSanjay Chaturvedi\nH/O Shivani Chaturvedi ******************************************",

She made me comfortable from day 1 of my appointment, her patience, guidance and tolerance towards her patients is a remarkable quality in her. I remember troubling her even at odd hours with the smallest doubts to which she promptly responded, she never objected on asking my smallest doubts and always made me comfortable. In fact I was so comfortable with her that I wanted only her to deliver my baby as I could only rest my faith and confidence in her as my doctor. She never misguides her patients and is always very honest and upfront to her patients.\n\nShe is by far the best Gynecologist I have come across and I say that by experience !!!\n\nJaya Aggarwal",

Gives maximum time to hear patient views..I have not yet met any other Doctor like her who takes so much personal care of the patientsShe is caring, empathetic and most importantly you get to establish a connection with the Doctor; which I feel is seldom today. One of the best doctors I have met.It\u2019s a great honour even to write about you, most importantly, keeping in touch with your patients is so heart touching.I strongly believe doctor is not someone who just cure illness of the patient but also boosts the morale of the patient so that they can feel much better than ever. it was there in your treatment for sure.what else can one ask for from a doctor. To put simple about how to express my gratitude \u2013 No one wants to see a doctor being a patient,  but it\u2019s worth to keep in contact with someone like you who is a well established overall person.Its so good to see my wife come back to normal , thanks for your treatment with personal care",

When my wife was taken to the labour room, there also Dhwani Mam gave a lot of courage to my wife and finally the normal delivery was done.  I am very grateful for the dhwani mam.\n\nShe is a very friendly, polite and experienced doctor.. She does her work with full dedication which you can experience once you meet her. \nNow whenever I or someone in my family planned for a baby, we will definitely visit Dr. Dhwani Mam and I highly recommend Dr Dhwani to all moms also",
