I did not give him any ultrasound and any other reports but after few months I did show on my ultrasound that I have this problem. I decided to go for the surgery and I wanted to do it only through him as he was the only doctor could tell me the actual problem and none other could do in so many years. I did go to so many doctors but all they could say is it\u2019s hormonal problem and some women get pain. I was so frustrated all these years for not knowing what\u2019s wrong and why do I need to go through such a severe pain. He did my surgery and it\u2019s been 3 days I\u2019m am recovering. *** * *** *** ** **** ** ** * ********* *************** I am sure I will be feeling much better from now.",
