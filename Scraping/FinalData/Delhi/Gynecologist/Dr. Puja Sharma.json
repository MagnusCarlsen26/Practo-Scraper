Majorly, I would like to highlight that during the pregnancy of 9 month my wife didn\u2019t get any maternity related complications, very minor issues came up but the resolution was one call away. My first baby is just 1 year 3 month old, my second baby conceived unwillingly  too early, we were very tensed at that moment and unable to fix any decision then we consulted to mam and with the guidance of Dr. Puja Sharma, we decided to deliver the baby and started medication. My wife  haemoglobin level was little low at last week, since she was not having the proper diet and my first baby also used to have mother feed, it was around 8.2 which was not sufficient for delivery then any how mam managed and started some medication and then at the time of delivery that reaches somewhere around 10.5 which was sufficient for delivery now. We always wanted delivery with normal delivery and requested mam for the same, mam always assured us that she will try her level best for normal delivery rest situation will decide what it is going to be at the time of delivery. We prayed for god for happing god and finally my both baby delivered first baby and second baby as normal delivery, now my new born and my wife both are absolutely perfect and healthy, my wife recovered within a week. To be very honest, I would say we never even no one has seen god but literally i felt she is just like god for us where as in Covid situation she was stood for us,  few of the moment\u2019s my wife gave up at the time of delivery but mam had encouraged her and forced her to think good and positive resulted we have sweet family now. Thanks a ton mam for all your guidance and support.",

The condition was well explained, and further advice was also given to my husband and I. I was also assisted by her during WhatsApp late at night, she also got back to me on my ultrasound report explaining my condition, future road map, and also was open to discuss my case with my dermatologist (as my skin recently started to break out). \n\nDr. Puja was friendly, I could speak very openly about everything - something that is extremely important.\n\nThank you for your kind assistance and patience to hear my skin journey, my pregnancy plans and my health story.",

She prescribed as a doctor, encouraged me like a mentor and treated me like a sister. Dr. Pooja and all members of her team is very co-operative and helpful. I Would definitely recommend to friends and relatives. Thank you so much.",

Majorly, I would like to highlight that during the pregnancy of 9 month my wife didn\u2019t get any maternity related complications, very minor issues came up but the resolution was one call away. My first baby is just 1 year 3 month old, my second baby conceived unwillingly  too early, we were very tensed at that moment and unable to fix any decision then we consulted to mam and with the guidance of Dr. Puja Sharma, we decided to deliver the baby and started medication. My wife  haemoglobin level was little low at last week, since she was not having the proper diet and my first baby also used to have mother feed, it was around 8.2 which was not sufficient for delivery then any how mam managed and started some medication and then at the time of delivery that reaches somewhere around 10.5 which was sufficient for delivery now. We always wanted delivery with normal delivery and requested mam for the same, mam always assured us that she will try her level best for normal delivery rest situation will decide what it is going to be at the time of delivery. We prayed for god for happing god and finally my both baby delivered first baby and second baby as normal delivery, now my new born and my wife both are absolutely perfect and healthy, my wife recovered within a week. To be very honest, I would say we never even no one has seen god but literally i felt she is just like god for us where as in Covid situation she was stood for us,  few of the moment\u2019s my wife gave up at the time of delivery but mam had encouraged her and forced her to think good and positive resulted we have sweet family now. Thanks a ton mam for all your guidance and support.",

I was also assisted by her during WhatsApp late at night, she also got back to me on my ultrasound report explaining my condition, future road map, and also was open to discuss my case with my dermatologist (as my skin recently started to break out). \n\nDr. Puja was friendly, I could speak very openly about everything - something that is extremely important.\n\nThank you for your kind assistance and patience to hear my skin journey, my pregnancy plans and my health story.",

If you were sitting for 30 minutes you could have scanned qr code beforehand as it is clearly mentioned in booking instructions. Regarding 3000/-counseling was properly done regarding the indication of the test.  Sorry, that we forgot to mention the test price before but you were never forced to pay the same.

I had been suffering from lichen sclerosus for 1.5 years and none of my previous physicians were able to correctly diagnose the disease. I had to leave my job since my disease was being misdiagnosed as UTI due to which the prescribed medications were ineffective which was difficult to handle along with an 10-11 hour job. But due to Dr. Puja's patient nature I was able to explain all my symptoms and at once she could tell that the disease is not an infection but might be a skin disease. It has been 2 months now since I'm getting treated under Dr. Puja due to this I'm finally fit enough to join back my organization.",
