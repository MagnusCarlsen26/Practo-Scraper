We brain stormed for a day at Rosewalk on which gynecologist we should choose as there List is endless.

Previously, we had a very bad experience with a senior gynecologist at a reputed hospital in Delhi (don't want to Name any), hence this time we did not want to take any risk in choosing the right gynecologist. 

I can assure you that Dr Helai is the best gynecologist in Delhi. With Dr Helai, the entire pregancy was a smooth ride. She was always available on whatsapp, phone or any mode of communication. She was never in a rush during appointments and listened to us carefully if we had any doubts. She had a solution to all our problems and she always went in length to explain everything with patience.

My wife had a normal delivery under the guidance of Dr Helai which I guess is unheard of nowadays. The doctor has high work ethics *** *** ***** *** ******* *** *********** ***** ** ********* ****** *******

I was infected with Covid-19 during my pregnancy where my gynecologist refused to treat me stating that I should consult a physician. The physician too refused to treat stating that I should consult my gynae. Then I contacted Dr Helai Gupta she treated me during that time without charging me anything and answered my every little query. She always gave prompt responses to my calls & messages. She was extremely caring, supportive and kind and helped me sail through these difficult safely.
My delivery at Spring Meadows Hospital, East of Kailash, New Delhi was an enjoyable experience. This place has the best team of staff. They all were extremely courteous, helpful, compassionate, empathetic and sincere which has exceeded my expectations.
I would very much recommend her & Spring Meadows Hospital to all my friends and family.
