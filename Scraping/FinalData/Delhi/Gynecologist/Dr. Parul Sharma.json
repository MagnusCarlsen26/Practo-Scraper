Talking to her felt like talking to a dear friend who genuinely cared about my well-being. She addressed all my worries about my unwanted pregnancy with patience and compassion, making me feel valued and supported throughout the process. I couldn't have asked for a better gynecologist to help me through a difficult situation.I highly recommend her to anyone in need of compassionate and competent care.",
