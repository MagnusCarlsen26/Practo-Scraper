Earlier we did visited other doctors but in vain\u2026She was so friendly to us and patiently  listened to my wife queries and replied suitably with a smile, she is very knowledgeable, sensible & informative  indeed and she did replied to many queries during these last 3-4 months periods, it was a wonderful experience even though sometimes  I feel that our queries may hear weird, but she patiently replied &  guided us in every possible way, despite being busy in her hectic every day schedule. Dr Stuti is an Angel to us and she is incredible in performing the very critical surgery & taken great care to my wife health, by the Grace of God  my wife is fine now, she is lovely to speak at every appointment and every time in her call ( her immediate response & ability to connect is awesome  )  she put encouraging words to my wife and our strength is Dr Ma\u2019am to whom we are very much dependent, and I highly recommend her anyone looking for a specialist..We Pray to The God and Wish her and her Family  a long life with good health!!! Thanks a lot Ma\u2019am !! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

She have always consulted my wife as her own child , be it physical consultation or on calls or WhatsApp. \nWe visited her for child planning and irregular menstrual issues with wife which was suspected as pcod/pcos. Later wife has mentioned that she feels bloated all day and consumes very less food and also that she is suffering from nausea, loss of appetite, headache etc. On this Dr. Stuti immediately recommended the best Ultrasound doctor in Dwarka, Dr. Vershey. Also she did recommend top bariatric surgeon if abdominal mass is confirmed post ultrasound. Wife actually had more than 4.5 inch of mass in her left side of stomach. She got treated by top doctor, thanks to Dr. Stuti , she came as an angel in our life and saved my wife just in time and recommended right doctors for the process ahead. She also did helped us for smooth transition at top hospital in Dwarka and is continuously following up till date. \nGod bless wealth of good health to the Angel, the mother, the beautiful soul. Thank you Doctor for everything. Shall visit soon for child planning soon. God Bless. \nHighly Highly RECOMMENDED Guys\u2026..You will not return unsatisfied. \n ",

Earlier we did visited other doctors but in vain\u2026She was so friendly to us and patiently  listened to my wife queries and replied suitably with a smile, she is very knowledgeable, sensible & informative  indeed and she did replied to many queries during these last 3-4 months periods, it was a wonderful experience even though sometimes  I feel that our queries may hear weird, but she patiently replied &  guided us in every possible way, despite being busy in her hectic every day schedule. Dr Stuti is an Angel to us and she is incredible in performing the very critical surgery & taken great care to my wife health, by the Grace of God  my wife is fine now, she is lovely to speak at every appointment and every time in her call ( her immediate response & ability to connect is awesome  )  she put encouraging words to my wife and our strength is Dr Ma\u2019am to whom we are very much dependent, and I highly recommend her anyone looking for a specialist..We Pray to The God and Wish her and her Family  a long life with good health!!! Thanks a lot Ma\u2019am !! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",
