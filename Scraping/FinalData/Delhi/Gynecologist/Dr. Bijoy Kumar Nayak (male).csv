,,0,0,YES,"Dr Bijoy Kumar Nayak has to be one the best of his field. Me and my wife were very tensed due to huge ovarian cysts in both her ovaries, she also had fibroid in her uterus . But after meeting Bijoy sir we felt really confident. He correctly diagnosed it as endometriosis and performed laparoscopic surgery. Everything went really  smooth and my wife has recovered quite well. I would recommend him to everyone *** ****** ***** * **** ************* ",2020-12-10 15:15:24,False,True,Amit Kumar,,,
