We did a thorough search on best gynaecologist and we are glad to say that we made the best choice. Highly recommended for pre and post pregnancy. We had some complications but Dr Anubha really worked it out like a charm. Every question and queries we had were carefully listened and resolved by Doc. There was never a single time she didn\u2019t answer her call regardless of time we call. Extremely satisfied and happy with her treatment.",

She gave her 200% for NVD.) \n3. \u2060Dr Anubha jain is easily approachable and very very polite to all the patients inspite of being such a top ranked and renowned Doctor in Delhi and outside. \n4 Dr Anubha jain never prescribed me a bundle of medicines rather she believes in minimum medicines and home made items. \nThere is lot to say about her but briefly I recommend her as she is the best Doctor I have ever experienced in my life.***  ***** ***** **** ** ******* ***** *** ** **** **** ****** **** ****** **** ** ***** ****** **** *** ***** **** **** ********* ***** ****** ******** ***** ******* ********  *** **** *************",

She gave her 200% for NVD.) \n3. \u2060Dr Anubha jain is easily approachable and very very polite to all the patients inspite of being such a top ranked and renowned Doctor in Delhi and outside. \n4 Dr Anubha jain never prescribed me a bundle of medicines rather she believes in minimum medicines and home made items. \nThere is lot to say about her but briefly I recommend her as she is the best Doctor I have ever experienced in my life.***  ***** ***** **** ** ******* ***** *** ** **** **** ****** **** ****** **** ** ***** ****** **** *** ***** **** **** ********* ***** ****** ******** ***** ******* ********  *** **** *************",

Trust me, you ll get many doctors who ll treat you quite well but not all support you emotionally just like she did.

As pregnancy is that part of life where we have questions on everything and every moment here comes the best part as She is really calm and her explanation to every question will make you calm. We met her at Medha hospital pitampura, i should say she should change her hospital as the services at hospital is very poor. That hospital is running by the name of former Dr Anita Rajurkar who passed away last year.\nIn the late 7th month of pregnancy we were introduced to Dr Anubha not by choice but like it was last trimester and Dr Anita passed away so we had to continue our treatment with Dr Anubha but by god grace we never felt that we are not in safe hands. She is kind, soft and her smile will always give you comfort that you can relax in these days as well.\nLastly when everything was fine with a big thumps up for Dr Anubha jain only a small negative marking on big nails of Dr as my wife was little scared looking that.\nI strongly refer Dr Anubha Jain.",
