,"Pregnancy care and management,",0,0,YES,***** *** ** *** **** * **** **** ** never felt like a doctor patient relationship but like someone we had known since forever. As a doctor she had the most keen eye for detail and prescribed me the right medicines during my pregnancy. No matter at what time I messaged her whenever she would see the msg she would reply promptly and being my first pregnancy I was always anxious but she always had a soothing reply. She never advised unnecessary check ups or meetings. She ensured I had a normal delivery even though I was so close to giving up. Thank you so much Ma’m you’re an angel. Doctors like you are very few. ,2022-05-12 07:50:09,False,True,Radhika Sikka,,,
