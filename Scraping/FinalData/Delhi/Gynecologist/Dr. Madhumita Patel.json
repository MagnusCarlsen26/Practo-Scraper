She is very patient, answers all the basic questions, and is highly knowledgeable, especially in high-risk pregnancies. Her approach to the problems is very unique and practical. With Ma'am's support, we are blessed with a baby girl through normal delivery. Right from month 1 till delivery, she has been supporting and there for us, providing the right direction. Thank you, ma'am, for all your support, guidance, and being there for us in every single step. We are highly obliged to have you in our lives.",

Initially we were worried and scared too (due to huge fibroids my wife has). Dr Madhumita was very patient and helpful , and explained all possible steps we could take further.  Dr Madhumita treated my wife during 1st trimester and ensured we do not have any miscarriage (since it was a high-risk pregnancy). \nWe are grateful to Dr Madhumita for her expert treatment and diagnosis during our initial phase of pregnancy. My wife delivered a baby girl in Oct, 2023 (early Preterm) and she is keeping well now.

She explains everything very nicely. At that time I was facing a financial crunch and I was amazed to find her fees to be so minimal only Rs. 600/- She made my things so easy like I dint have to go physically for blood test. She provided me a number, they came and took the blood sample from home. I didn't have to visit the hospital for documents submission before the admission. She has links with four hospital and she has her own staff , she just provided me a number, I contacted the person and my work was done sitting at home. I opted for normal delivery but due to some complications I had to go for c sec so that means it was a planned c sec. I chose my date and my timings that was the most amazing part of the whole journey. My baby was born on an auspicious day and within auspicious timings. In my previous delivery which was done under a different doctor which was c sec ,a forceful c sec. It could have been a normal delivery easily but she went for a c sec only. And there I could not tell my doctor that I want this day and this time. She was just after me to do my c sec she didn't even try for a normal delivery. And here with Dr. Madhumita Patel she atleast tried for it but it could not happen that's a different thing. Here if I face any sort of problem regarding health or any other thing related to hospital I used to call her or drop a msg and my problem gets resolved. Like my elder daughter who is 2.9 years old wanted to meet me after delivery and children below 14 years are not allowed in the hospital. I simply called her she made it done and I was so happy \ud83d\ude0a. I simply love the doctor. Her behaviour is mind blowing and so down to earth that you would like to talk to her again and again. She came for visit the next day and she took snaps with me and my family that was so nice of her where would you find such a doctor? atleast I would not find any.",

                "review_text": "Ok , So My name is Shobhit Singh, My Wife( Babita Singh ) was few weeks pregnant so I visited a doctor nearby before I met Dr. Madhumita Patel but was not satisfied from the previous doctor's services . So I was looking for someone who can answer my queries and handle this case professionally, I was searching for good doctors on Google , and luckily I found Dr. Madhumita Patel's details there, The Reviews out there were too good to be true so I was a bit concerned whether the reviews are genuine or not , but the way those reviews were written I knew somewhere in my heart , that those reviews were genuine.. So we decided that we should go to her clinic , after going to her clinic and after our session was finished ,I knew why people were saying that she is the best, then n there I knew that we are not going elsewhere and she will be the one who will deliver our baby. She has many qualities like she is very soft spoken, she is very humble, she has a lot of patience, She will talk to you with a smile on her face , She won't  charge you unnecessarily , She will always answer your call and the list goes on n on but the best part about her personality is that she is very honest. If You can find a doctor whom you can trust blindly, you have found a Jackpot. So Here we are after few months , i was blessed with a Baby girl on 21-12-21 through C-section  as my wife's condition was not very suitable for normal delivery , Dr. Madhumita still tried very hard that if there is something that can be done about it, but my wife's body didn't respond accordingly so we decided that we should not take any more chance and go for the C-section delivery. Luckily there was not a lot of blood loss and because of Dr. Madhumita's experience and accuracy everything went smoothly.. I would like to thank you doctor on my wife's behalf as well because You always motivated her throughout the journey and In the end I can't thank you enough for the efforts you have done for us , Your hard work has finally paid off and Thank You for giving my baby girl in my arms successfully as I was looking forward for a baby girl and my wish was granted by God and you were chosen to do it . Thank You from the bottom of my heart.Regards,Babita & ShobhitP.s.- You can trust Dr. Madhumita Patel without any doubt because you might not find a lot of doctors these days who are so honest with you. So Don't Worry about anything and just Go by her words . ",

No unnecessary testing and reports.\nDuring the pregnancy, everything was going well til 8th month but i was worried coz my wife have beta thalassemia, a Genetic disorder. and was in regular touch with Dr. We reported each and every symptoms during pregnancy and she cleared them very well.\nIn last month,my wife developed some symptoms which were not good for baby. She advised us to terminate pregnancy during 37th week and planed for early delivery. We were very tensed at the time she told us that but she gave us her full support and confidance for this.\nWife admitted to hospital at Madhukar rainbow on 21st Dec. First she tried for normal delivery for almost 20 Hr but findings were not good so we decided for C section after that i was blessed with a cute baby girl\ud83d\ude0d.\nDelivery was fine, since wife had lower hemoglobin, we Booked one unit of Blood but that was not required because operation was so fine that much bleeding was not there.\nToday after 12 days, wife recover almost fully.\n\nI definitely recommed all the expecting moms to plan delivery under Ma'am guidance.\n\nBlessed to find her during our pregnancy journey \nIt's very hard these time to find a dr like she is.\n",

I don't have words to express how much I appreciate her willingness to listen to my concerns and spend ample time with me at each appointment. She made me feel like my concerns were valid and reasonable. She explained each topic in ways I can understand and the information  provided by her was extremely helpful. I would like to thank her from the bottom of my heart for all the help, wisdom, kindness and care. Most doctors try to shuffle you in and out as quickly as possible and I never felt rushed by her. I left feeling better after each visit.i had been facing complications from the 5th month of pregnancy but today me and my baby are safely sitting at home only because of her.i had a c section delivery I was very scared at d tym of surgery but she and her team made me calm, they were very supportive, caring nd helpful.

She is very patient, answers all the basic questions, and is highly knowledgeable, especially in high-risk pregnancies. Her approach to the problems is very unique and practical.

We could not continue with her since we are very far from her however, whenever we visited my wife's place, we ensured that we get in touch with her in the clinic. Initially we were worried and scared too (due to huge fibroids my wife has). Dr Madhumita was very patient and helpful , and explained all possible steps we could take further.  Dr Madhumita treated my wife during 1st trimester and ensured we do not have any miscarriage (since it was a high-risk pregnancy). \nWe are grateful to Dr Madhumita for her expert treatment and diagnosis during our initial phase of pregnancy. My wife delivered a baby girl in Oct, 2023 (early Preterm) and she is keeping well now.

She always tries to give best possible advise. I would highly highly recommend her to every mom-to-be for best advice and smooth pregnancy journey.

She explains everything very nicely. At that time I was facing a financial crunch and I was amazed to find her fees to be so minimal only Rs. 600/- She made my things so easy like I dint have to go physically for blood test. She provided me a number, they came and took the blood sample from home. I didn't have to visit the hospital for documents submission before the admission. She has links with four hospital and she has her own staff , she just provided me a number, I contacted the person and my work was done sitting at home. I opted for normal delivery but due to some complications I had to go for c sec so that means it was a planned c sec. I chose my date and my timings that was the most amazing part of the whole journey. My baby was born on an auspicious day and within auspicious timings. In my previous delivery which was done under a different doctor which was c sec ,a forceful c sec. It could have been a normal delivery easily but she went for a c sec only. And there I could not tell my doctor that I want this day and this time. She was just after me to do my c sec she didn't even try for a normal delivery. And here with Dr. Madhumita Patel she atleast tried for it but it could not happen that's a different thing. Here if I face any sort of problem regarding health or any other thing related to hospital I used to call her or drop a msg and my problem gets resolved. Like my elder daughter who is 2.9 years old wanted to meet me after delivery and children below 14 years are not allowed in the hospital. I simply called her she made it done and I was so happy \ud83d\ude0a. I simply love the doctor. Her behaviour is mind blowing and so down to earth that you would like to talk to her again and again. She came for visit the next day and she took snaps with me and my family that was so nice of her where would you find such a doctor? atleast I would not find any.",

So I was looking for someone who can answer my queries and handle this case professionally, I was searching for good doctors on Google , and luckily I found Dr. Madhumita Patel's details there, The Reviews out there were too good to be true so I was a bit concerned whether the reviews are genuine or not , but the way those reviews were written I knew somewhere in my heart , that those reviews were genuine.. So we decided that we should go to her clinic , after going to her clinic and after our session was finished ,I knew why people were saying that she is the best, then n there I knew that we are not going elsewhere and she will be the one who will deliver our baby. She has many qualities like she is very soft spoken, she is very humble, she has a lot of patience, She will talk to you with a smile on her face , She won't  charge you unnecessarily , She will always answer your call and the list goes on n on but the best part about her personality is that she is very honest. If You can find a doctor whom you can trust blindly, you have found a Jackpot. So Here we are after few months , i was blessed with a Baby girl on 21-12-21 through C-section  as my wife's condition was not very suitable for normal delivery , Dr. Madhumita still tried very hard that if there is something that can be done about it, but my wife's body didn't respond accordingly so we decided that we should not take any more chance and go for the C-section delivery. Luckily there was not a lot of blood loss and because of Dr. Madhumita's experience and accuracy everything went smoothly.. I would like to thank you doctor on my wife's behalf as well because You always motivated her throughout the journey and In the end I can't thank you enough for the efforts you have done for us , Your hard work has finally paid off and Thank You for giving my baby girl in my arms successfully as I was looking forward for a baby girl and my wish was granted by God and you were chosen to do it . Thank You from the bottom of my heart.Regards,Babita & ShobhitP.s.- You can trust Dr. Madhumita Patel without any doubt because you might not find a lot of doctors these days who are so honest with you. So Don't Worry about anything and just Go by her words . ",

                "review_text": "First of all thanks to Dr. Madhumita ji for making our first baby delivery very smooth even after complications during 36 weeks for pregnancy.\nInitially we visited her in the month of June for the first consultation & we got full confidence over her for our complete pregnancy term.\nWe never thought of second opinion during the consultation.\nMa'am is very polite, give proper time for consultation and clear all the doubts until you feel confident. No unnecessary testing and reports.\nDuring the pregnancy, everything was going well til 8th month but i was worried coz my wife have beta thalassemia, a Genetic disorder. and was in regular touch with Dr. We reported each and every symptoms during pregnancy and she cleared them very well.\nIn last month,my wife developed some symptoms which were not good for baby. She advised us to terminate pregnancy during 37th week and planed for early delivery. We were very tensed at the time she told us that but she gave us her full support and confidance for this.\nWife admitted to hospital at Madhukar rainbow on 21st Dec. First she tried for normal delivery for almost 20 Hr but findings were not good so we decided for C section after that i was blessed with a cute baby girl\ud83d\ude0d.\nDelivery was fine, since wife had lower hemoglobin, we Booked one unit of Blood but that was not required because operation was so fine that much bleeding was not there.\nToday after 12 days, wife recover almost fully.\n\nI definitely recommed all the expecting moms to plan delivery under Ma'am guidance.\n\nBlessed to find her during our pregnancy journey \nIt's very hard these time to find a dr like she is.\n",

The genuine concern and care she showed truly helped me in ways I cannot express. I don't have words to express how much I appreciate her willingness to listen to my concerns and spend ample time with me at each appointment. She made me feel like my concerns were valid and reasonable. She explained each topic in ways I can understand and the information  provided by her was extremely helpful. I would like to thank her from the bottom of my heart for all the help, wisdom, kindness and care. Most doctors try to shuffle you in and out as quickly as possible and I never felt rushed by her. I left feeling better after each visit.i had been facing complications from the 5th month of pregnancy but today me and my baby are safely sitting at home only because of her.i had a c section delivery I was very scared at d tym of surgery but she and her team made me calm, they were very supportive, caring nd helpful. She is an amazing person *** *** **** ************ ** ****** ***** ********* *** ******* ***** *** .I would definitely recommend her.",

Lots of takeaways from Ma'am in regards to Good health recovery always being positive for any of the health issues reported.Long story short My wife had two surgeries within 8 months and removed left overy and Fallopian tube and one appendicitis. Dr. Madhumita went out-of-the-box not only in my wife's first surgery but also in the second surgery as well of my wife. At the time of my wife's second surgery she helped us with finalizing the best hospital, doctors for the surgery and end to end coordination. During my wife's high risk pregnancy (previous surgeries and Gestational diabetes) journey i received all the support and guidance from Ma'am anything anytime I asked her on call and WhatsApp I always received response and guidance.I never imagined that my wife could give NVD without her moral support and guidance. Ma'am has an excellent team of supportive staff. She made us feel like home whenever we visited her and gave her time to listen to all the problems.A few months back for us getting pregnant and having a child was a distant dream but with Dr Madhumita ma'am we are living our dream as reality.",

But after experiencing Dr. Madhumita Patel's treatment and handling of pre & post-pregnancy treatment, I must recommend her to all.  She is a superwoman & I am saying this because whenever we need her, Dr. Madhumita Patel was there whether day or night to look after me.\n\nDr. Madhumita Patel handles every situation in a very easy way & removes all my stress during my pregnancy.  Dr. Madhumita Patel makes me comfortable during pre & post-pregnancy treatment.  She is the right one because she makes every consultation easier for me.  Dr. Madhumita Patel feels you like your best friend and for this reason, you will not miss consulting any problems.\n\nI have a lot of respect for Dr. Madhumita Patel in my heart & I thank her for all the efforts she has done to fulfill my dream.\n\nGOD BLESS HER.",

Madhumita guided me really well throughout the journey and made sure we always have the right information with us.I am blessed with baby boy on 15th Oct and it was all thanks to her support, patience and guidance that my delivery was normal.She is one of the warmest persons I have met. Mam understands and always suggests the best possible solution. I trusted her blindly and inspite of having so many people around during delivery, it was only her words which gave me strength to bear the labour pain.Also, opposite to the normal notion of doctors preferring csec or any other malpractice- you will see Madhumita as a rare gem and actually passing any such unwanted need considering the situation.She deserves all the success, love and recognition for the way she is keeping up the excellent quality of professional work. Thank you again mam for everything!Suniti ",

She hears you out patiently and gives you sufficient time, while carefully answering all your queries. Her gentle and passionate way of interacting with her patients made us become very faithful in her approach. She is a thorough counselor as we discussed other issues too facing during our first journey to Parenthood. \n\nI will always be grateful for the excellent care provided by Dr. Madhumita to my wife. \n\nShe is a perfect person for the nature of her work. Great admiration and Respect for her!\n\nGod bless you abundantly.\n\nThank you for making this experience a memorable one that we will cherish all our life! \n\nHighly recommended!!!",

I even dont have words to express my thank to Dr. Patel in lieu of her kind support in my wife' pre natal check-up (PNC) and delivery. We have had a wonderful experience with the doctor. \n\nWe had visited four (4) Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for PNC but were not satisfied unless we met Dr. Patel. She gave the best possible solution for PNC and delivery. She listened to us carefully and put us at ease. She is a soft spoken, good listner, patient and kind hearted lady. Apart from these humanitarian virtues, she is a highly intelligent and qualified doctor **** **** ********* ** *** **** who does not believe in excessive medication. We are really happy and satisfied with Dr. Madhumita Patel's support and treatment and do strongly recommend to visit the doctor once. Trust me you will not be disappointed. Again thanx to Dr. Madhumita.\n\nAnjana Garg \nNarendra Garg \nMoti Bagh-1, New Delhi",

I am really lucky that Madhumita Mam was my choice by God's grace. I have seen doctors doing C-Sec delivery after trying for few hours if the patient gives up but Dr Madhumita is just the opposite. She will encourage you for normal delivery till the end and will keep you motivated so that you don't loose strength and hope. Mine was a high risk pregnancy and we faced various medical conditions right from 1st trimester to 3rd trimester but thanks to Madhumita Mam she handled my case so well.\nUnlike other doctors who are least bothered about patients concerns and doubts, Dr Madhumita Patel always listens to her patients and clears each and every doubt. Despite of her busy schedule she is never in a hurry instead gives enough time to her each and every patient. She takes effort to explain the issue to patients, encourages them to read and research about the issue and then gives medical advice. She explains every vaccination and medicine before offering. The best part is that she is always available on WhatsApp and phone for any urgent issue. \nI have found such a nice connection with her now, I feel so friendly and homely by meeting her and talking to her. She is really a gem of a person. More than a doctor she has also helped me with my post natal concerns and problems which shows her generosity towards her patients. She not only guided me on how to take care of myself and my baby but also guided my family to understand  my concerns and help me with this tough phase when me and my baby both are adjusting in this new environment and new phase of life. Being a new mom sometimes it's very difficult to handle this change but if you have a doctor and a generous person like Madhumita Mam, it all becomes very easy. Thank you mam for such a beautiful and unforgettable journey.\nTotally recommend her to anyone looking to start their motherhood journey.",

She kept motivating me in the labor room and had trust in my abilities.\nVisiting her used to be like a therapy for me as she would clear all my doubts and calm me down if I used to overthink about anything. \nShe also encouraged me to stay active throughout the pregnancy for normal delivery.\nWe were blessed to have her as our doctor and trusted her blindly.\nI highly recommend her for healthy pregnancy.",

My life has been made better by Dr. Madhumita's support, direction, care, and sensitivity. She is an angel. I would absolutely recommend her to all of my family members and friends. We always felt more positive and had more energy after seeing \"Dr. Madhumita\" every time. There were periods early on in my wife's pregnancy when she felt quite anxious and depressed, and I will give \"Dr. Madhumita\" full credit for providing her strength, optimism, and the best possible treatment. She is empathetic towards everyone. Thank you.",

She listens to all your queries and lets you speak, without jumping into the next appointment. My pregnancy was very smooth. There was a cord wrapped around my baby's neck, but she was there throughout emitting positivity and confidence. She didn't let me panic. Unlike other doctors, she never sold unnecessary ultrasounds/ tests or medicines. \nAfter my delivery, my condition withered due to high BP, but she was there for me till I recovered. She\u2019ll treat you like her family. I am so thankful that I met her and elated that she delivered my baby.  *** ** *** **** ************* ** ***** Thank you so much Dr Madhumita.\n\nMuch Love\nSwati, Ashish and Caleb \ud83d\ude00",

She is truly dedicated, sincere, expert and perfect gynaecologist. Whenever an expecting parent needs to find a gynaecologist, they get on with one who works hard to serve the parent in a humanitarian way and handles her patients with care. The compassion with which she treats the patients is more effective than any medication. My wife's was a c-section case with Twin pregnency. It was little bit complicated where more care, continuous observation and expertness was required as compare to other cases and I must thank her for all the support, guidance and care. She had always been in continuous touch with us through out the pregnancy period and Most important that she  always replied all our queries, doubts over whatsapp as well. So grateful for your services ma'am. \nThanks & Regards ,\nVivek & Shikha",

I was doing google search for a good gynec, so based on the reviews I decided to visit at Dr. Madhumita's clinic. After visiting many of my questions were answered and I was feeling much better. Then I decided to continue with ma'am. There were many ups and downs during the whole pregnancy but ma'am always gave proper advice at the right time as a result of this today we got a baby boy. Ma'am nature is so kind and caring. I've always feels positivity around her. She is the best gynecologist with nominal charges which I've ever seen. \nI strongly recommend to everyone who's looking for a gynecologist kindly visit once to Dr. Madhumita Patel. \nHeartfelt Thanks to Dr.Madhumita ma'am from~ Vinay, Shilpi and our little champ 'Shivansh'.\n\nThanks practo,\ud83d\ude0a",

As I was discussing the same issue with my near one he said if you wish can pay a visit at City Speciality clinic. I reached their with my shy wife and lot of doubts. After waiting 15 mins it was moment of truth when I saw a smiling face on doctor's seat. She attended her with great compassion and minutely listening every concern. I had a relaxed expression on wife's face. Best part of story is I have a cute baby now named Vihaan and every thanks to \"MADHUMITA MA'AM\". So if you are finding yourself in my position or in dire need of suggestions related with pregnancy or women related issues knock the door here. Happiness here is guaranteed. \n\nRegards\nA happy father \nPunit",

She is someone who is approachable at all times. \n\n\nPregnancy period is risky if you do not know what is happening inside. Dr Madhumita made sure we are monitoring all stages of development and taking the right measures to ensure healthy development. \n\nIn today's times you hear more of C-section deliveries and complications rather than normal births. With the right guidance and advice Dr Madhumita was a great partner in preventing all that and our baby was delivered normally.\n\nWhatever you do just stick to one Gynaecologist and trust her till the end of your journey.",

Inclusive in terms of her friendly nature with patient, listening to all problems calmly, providing better advice. You seldom find a doctor who is so inclusive and approachable as she is. Her way of explaining things, her experience, friendly nature and calmness is what makes her a outstanding doctor. My wife had some complications and she took care each and everything very efficiently and properly. She is a superb and incredible doctor. Hassle free services and approachable all time. Just because of her (even having all the complications) we blessed with a baby boy and that too through a normal delivery. We truly appreciate all the help and support she had provided in my wife\u2019s pregnancy period. Dr Madhumita is certainly one of the best gynaecologist. Keep spreading your blessings and services. \n\nA big THANKS to you Dr Madhumita \n\nFrom Vikash, Sneha and our little champ Ayansh",

I was aware of my thyroid issue and she helped me keep it under control and also encouraged us to plan our family at the right time. I conceived in Oct 2020 without any extra treatment. She made sure baby's growth is normal during my pregnancy. She didn't recommend unnecessary supplements or tests. She took best care of me throughout my pregnancy. She attended to me with care and affection during all of my visits and was never in a haste to finish the appointment.She explained all the symptoms and diagnosis during my pregnancy. It was my first pregnancy so we always had lot of questions. I had a normal delivery under her care on 30th June 2021 and because of my normal delivery I had a quick recovery. Post delivery also she was in touch to ensure proper recovery. She is a wonderful person and an excellent doctor.   ",

She is a delight to talk to, always available for her patients round the clock. I had a history of diabetes, thyroid as well as BP from my mother's side. She made it a point to keep all these aspects under a constant check and under control throughout the term. Also she can be strict with weight gain but that's only bcz she wants that no lady has to undergo C-section. All thanks to her I have not experienced any extremities during my pregnancy. On D-Day, I gave up bcz of the pain but she did not. It's very rare to find such a doctor for this important phase of your life. She maintains good doc-patient relationship post delivery as well. If I ever plan a second child there is no doubt it will be delivered by Dr.Madhumita :-)",

A lot of my friends asked me to take a second opinion from a reputed doctor / hospital as well. However, I was so comfortable with Dr. Madhumita that i never felt any need to take second opinion. She was very supportive during my entire pregnancy and delivery time. She is easily approachable. She is just a call away even at 2am. She gave me a lot of support during labor. Post delivery also I keep visiting her even if there is a small concern because she explains everything with so much patience and politeness. I would recommend her to all the Moms to be.",

There were times when we had to call at odd times in case of any issue and she was always there to speak to us. She was also there during our babies birth and we were happy as we were more comfortable with her by our side instead of a new doctor.

Doctor Madhumita was quite sweet and supportive with explaining my every query.she even did my physical examination. There was no hurry and no crowded cabins... Especially during this covid situations, I felt at home and looking forward to get fully cured as this is my second day on medication. I'll write more once my medication is over. One thing I liked the most about her is she cared about her patients and is really responsible. I booked an evening slot which her website was showing due to some glitch, she is not there in evening slot but since it was booked she came just for me, which is quite a responsible and humane act. \n",

She herself and her staff are absolutely wonderful. Even in the stressful covid times I didn't have to worry.. This was my second pregnancy and in the last month needed constant attention, I could cruise through easily and without panic and anxiety just because of her assurance. She is simply fantastic. I rarely find such busy Dr giving personal attention even on off duty hours. Thank you madam for everything. I am forever grateful for such  smooth delivery and pre and post care. No matter whether we stay her or move from here you will be always there in my heart. \nCan't thank enough. ",

Right after 3 months I conceived. And then my pregnancy journey began.\nLet me tell you, she is not just a doctor, she is a real goddess. She is extremely positive and will keep you the same. Every time you visit her, half of your problems will be resolved just by meeting her and listening to her. I will never forget how she remained with me in labour room, when my baby heart rate started started going down. She cancelled all her appointments and stayed with me till my delivery. Although I had c section that\u2019s because my baby\u2019s cord was wrapped around the neck and then i made the decision to go for c section but before that i was adamant to go for normal delivery and madhumita mam also supported me alot.\nI am honestly blessed to have her as my gynac. Thank you so much mam for your love, care, support throughout my pregnancy journey. May god bless you with good health and happiness always.\n",

Her patience, calmness, and friendliness in one visit made me switch from my previous gynae to her for everything thereafter. I further visited her for my PCOD problem and she helped me resolve the issue with lifestyle changes- I think this was the best part- she didn't give me any medicine keeping in mind my future health. When I conceived we were out of Delhi for 3 months due to lockdown, however our trust in Dr. Madhumita made me consult her online for these three months rather than approaching any other local doctor there. My pregnancy was full of complications, including multiple fibroids and me and the entire family being tested positive with covid, however Dr. Madhumita made it possible for me to complete almost 36 weeks when we were not sure to complete even 24 weeks. During my ultrasounds, the radiologists were amazed that the pregnancy was carried so well even with the huge fibroid I had. It was her positive attitude that helped me everytime. I was on bedrest for most of the duration and she kept me going week by week.  She helped me get all my tests done hassle free through her contacts. My baby was delivered pre-term via emergency c-sec by her and she made sure we faced no issues at the hospital as well. I would recommend strongly recommend to visit her for any gynae issue one may face and she would help with minimum of meds and yet in the best possible way. ",

Your guidance has made the journey of motherhood wonderful.\n\nDr. Madhumita Patel is one of the best doctors, and she is a boon to mankind. She very patiently listens patient's concern/query, and makes you feel comfortable and then guides you accordingly. You will feel that you are in safe hands. She is always available on phone if any concerns or emergencies arise at odd hours.\n\nShe recommended Rainbow Children Hospital (Malviya Nagar) for the delivery. The Hospital's service was excellent, but the cost was way more than the suggested/estimated.\n\nOnce again, many thanks Madam! for your kind supports. ",

She has been a constant support for us. She has been readily available whether it's a mid-night or holidays. We got response from Ma'am over the WhatsApp and call for every little concern we had.\n\nAt clinic she gave us ample amount of time trying to understand our concerns and gave us proper reason for every test & medicines she prescribed. If we couldn't visit clinic she was available for online consultation. Although my wife developed Cholestasis of pregnancy at the 9th month, the delivery of baby was normal, Thank you to Ma'am for giving her full attention to us whenever necessary. My wife and baby are doing well and we are still getting proper guidance from Ma'am on post pregnancy conditions.\n",

Since, I was in Hyderabad and was first diagnosed with ovarian cyst 2 years back. But my doctor was less helpful and didn't bother to tell me the severity and consequences about this if left untreated. After marriage, I was trying for baby for almost an year. But failed. Then I have contacted Dr. Madhumita and shown her my earlier diagnosis reports. She told me the severity and also explained me the reason. By that time, my cyst was grown bigger and my right ovary was no more useful and surgery was one only option left.  She also assured me that I will be alright. The best thing is she was able to save my right ovary inspite of other complications. And now I am absolutely fine and feel healthy. *** ** **** *** *** *** I have full faith in her. * **** ********** *** *** ********* ** *** ** *** **** ******* I really mean it.
