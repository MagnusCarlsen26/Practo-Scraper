My experience with Dr. Patra has been extremely good. She is very patient while hearing a patient out. Her approach also seemed to be personalised to a patient's need, as opposed  to a one-size-fits-all approach. It helps a lot that she is willing to devote time and is extremely thorough. I was particularly happy with the detailed notes she makes in relation to the case, on every visit. It was very helpful to have detailed record of the treatment over a period of time. The fact that she is hands-on makes a big difference to the patient's comfort level. It was very easy to reach out to her for even small doubts that cropped every now and then, all the same when urgent care was needed, she was again immediately available to ensure that any emergency is attended to on priority. The overall experience has been very good.
