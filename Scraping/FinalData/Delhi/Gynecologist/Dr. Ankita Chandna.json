There is no iota of doubt in saying that she is a genius in her field and with her expertise and experience she can handle even the complicated case like mine. She is not only excellent but simple, soft spoken, ever smiling, approachable, optimistic, full of energy and positive thoughts. She understands and listens to the problems and apprehensions very patiently. She has guided and shown me the right path to enable me to sail through the journey of pregnancy very smoothly. Her continuous support, calm demeanour and thoughtful words are always appreciable. I am truly grateful to her.I pray to Almighty to grant all her wishes. She is an amazing doctor. I am blessed that Ankita Ma\u2019am came as an Angel in my life and made my dream come true. Her team members are also amazing. I would like to extend my special thanks to the co-ordinator Ms. Suruchi and Dr. Megha for their quick response, continuous support and positive motivation all the time.",

She is not only excellent but simple, soft spoken, ever smiling, approachable, optimistic, full of energy and positive thoughts. She understands and listens to the problems and apprehensions very patiently. She has guided and shown me the right path to enable me to sail through the journey of pregnancy very smoothly. Her continuous support, calm demeanour and thoughtful words are always appreciable. I am truly grateful to her.I pray to Almighty to grant all her wishes. She is an amazing doctor. I am blessed that Ankita Ma\u2019am came as an Angel in my life and made my dream come true. Her team members are also amazing.
