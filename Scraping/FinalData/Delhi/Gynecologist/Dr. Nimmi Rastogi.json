I was upset when my friend who was seeing this doctor passed her no to me. I booked from practo and got an early appointment. The doctor checked me thoroughly and got some tests done in the center only. The report too came early and was told to me by the receptionist. My treatment was started within two days and after a month my thyroid levels came low. The center is good with all facility. The doctor is very helpful and friendly. She listens patiently and gives not just medicines but also diet and lifestyle advice that is good for girls like me. Thank you",

My mother was put on a treatment and injections. Other doctors advised a minor operation ( D&C). Dr Nimmi Rastogi asked us to wait till the effect of medicine comes. After fourth visit my mom is feeling better though not completely cured. We are happy she didn't go for operation as her BP remains high. The clinic staff is polite and  every patient is treated with respect. Me and my mother will recommend the doctor to others.",

We found the clinic had all facility and we didn't have to run from one place to other place. All reports were given to us in a file and we were called for a consultantion after only 4 days. My mother was put on a treatment and injections. Other doctors advised a minor operation ( D&C). Dr Nimmi Rastogi asked us to wait till the effect of medicine comes. After fourth visit my mom is feeling better though not completely cured. We are happy she didn't go for operation as her BP remains high. The clinic staff is polite and  every patient is treated with respect. Me and my mother will recommend the doctor to others.",
