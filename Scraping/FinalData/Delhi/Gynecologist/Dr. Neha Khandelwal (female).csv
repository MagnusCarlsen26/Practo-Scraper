"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"Hi to all lovely mothers-to-be. We are elated and excited to share with you the birth of our baby boy on 12th Feb, our bundle of joy🤩🤩🤩

The journey for the last 9 months has been the most beautiful experience of my life. In the first week itself, we could feel that we might have conceived. Since we live outside India so we straight away went to Doctor and the doctor confirmed to us that we were pregnant. Because of covid-19 issues, our families were not able to join us there so we from the start had planned the birth of our child In New Delhi. The pregnancy went well for five and half months when I traveled back to Delhi. By then I had checked with friends and thoroughly googled the best pregnancy doctor in Delhi. 


I met Dr. Neha Khandelwal in my 26th month and with the first visit, I felt the relief that we have come to the right place. Dr. Neha guided us in every possible way, the transition from one doctor to another was smooth and during this whole time, I didn’t have any anxious moments.


We followed Dr. Neha’s each and every instruction religiously and till the approach of the ninth month, everything went smooth. On my 35th week, I developed symptoms of cough and fever, as suspected I tested positive for covid-19. I immediately contacted Dr. Neha. She reassured me that everything is going to be fine with instructions on how to take care of pregnancy with covid. A couple of days were stressful and everyone at home looked anxious. By God’s grace, my fever disappeared on 2nd day itself and it felt like a great relief. It took me 3-4 days more to completely recover and by the 5th day I felt completely fine.😊😊😊


We visited Doctor in the 37th Week and Dr. Neha told me to prepare the baby and body for the birth. Dr. Neha’s instructions regarding diet and exercises were very effective. Even though the target date for going into labor was 23rd Feb, my water broke on 11th Feb. We called Dr. Neha and Dr instructed us to come to the hospital immediately. By the time I reached the hospital, I started feeling contractions. Soon I found Dr. Neha by my bedside and in the next 4 hours, I was having full-blown contractions. We from the start planned for normal delivery so Dr Neha prepared me and the hospital staff accordingly. So finally the time came and every person in the labor room was so encouraging and set to have the baby delivered normally. I pushed hard and we dr could see the head of baby. In next one hour, we tried our best to deliver the baby normally, but since baby’s shoulders were not coming out so Dr. Neha took the call to go ahead for C–section. I was transferred to OT and a little past after midnight, our sunshine was out in this world.🥳🥳🥳🥳

On the morning of 12th Feb we had a minor issue, we called Dr. Neha and found her again by my bedside in 30 minutes. It was amusing to see her so much concerned about our health and comfort. Dr. Neha’s instructions are so clear and backed with complete information that it doesn’t leave a shred of doubt in your mind. Now I can hold my baby in my hands and forget the rest of the world, and no words can explain that feeling.😍😍😍😍
 
I wish you all happy and healthy pregnancy. Consider yourself lucky to be able to experience this journey.

Waited so long to thank our Obs. & Gynae Dr. Neha Khandelwal Pandit for exceptional work.
Her well renowned instincts, gut feelings that come definitely with experience and knowledge along with trying to make every upcoming delivery a much better experience for couples.

Her hunger quote “want to do better than the best”.

She was connected throughout my journey which usually many pregnant women’s look for.

She vouches for you.

Had read in many books that angels come from heavenly abode by tearing the clouds to deliver a kid - That splendid feeling.

We as couples felt special after making this leap jump from taking decision to move from pune in 2nd month to Delhi. Registered with premier chain of Cloud 9 - Being a parent today I am happy to say - Yes, they know moms.

This journey is an expedition and worth remembering for parenthood.

Some exceptional work worth to praise which makes her treatment different as we learnt by discussing with friends, family and colleagues are

1. Neonatal Support : best part was neonatal support initiating a beautiful skin to skin contact touch and breastfeeding after a minute of birth.

2. Lactation support : Some over the top professionals to counsel you on lactation process.

3. Massage therapist looking after me since start of gynae appointments,Phenomenal environment that you would feel energised.

4. Prompt Nursing : TAT to nursing was great. ( A big nightmare) Thanks to her team at cloud nine hospital.

I must say that Neha ma'am is truly a gem in my life as because of her persistent push for normal delivery, I managed to deliver the baby normally. I started consulting her in my 3rd month and right from my very first visit, I understood that she's the right person to bring my baby to this world. Her guidance and positivity helped me a lot during my pregnancy especially during the time when I was completely negative and was losing my mind because of mood swings. Her friendly advice not just as my doctor but as a mother herself gave me new hope and brought positivity in my pregnancy. On the day of my delivery, when I was unable to bear labour pain, i almost gave up and requested Neha Ma'am and her team multiple times to go for the C section but her team motivated me to have patience and deliver normally. They showed trust in me when i almost lost it. In Delivery room, she brought with herself so much positive energy which gave me strength to bear the pain and within mins, I managed to deliver our baby with a smiling face.
 It's all because of the efforts of Neha Ma'am and her team that today I am recovering so well and even the baby is doing well. I would also like to thank Cordinator Neha Ma'am who managed all the appointments so well and for always being so sweet.
A piece of advice for all the new mothers to be - please follow Neha Ma'am's advice blindly and I assure, you all will give birth to a new life with flying colours.

All credit goes to dr Neha Khandelwal and rainbow heavinly experience. It was not possible without neha to deliver naturally.
 Sharing my parenting journey... We were searching for good hospital to deliver naturally. Started with holy family trust hospital which was a Bad. . Where nurses and doctor herself treat you like a professionl criminal.. Where you get shouted and become victim of doctors outrage without any reason. Remind you thats even when this trusted hospital charge similar to a private facility.
Things took complete u turn when we got introduced to dr neha from one of acquaintance who had great experience. She is elite professional and provide crisp consultations on every visit. I remember on week  38 when in growth scan she identified something which could have caused fetal distress if we would havr waited for week 40. Thanks to dr neha and rainbows very detailed scan report. Believe me i have not seen such a report so detailed and captures all knitty grittes.
Then the day came we were introduced to induced labor and it started. I remember dr neha came and advised me to take deep breatging and perforn lot of ball jumps whicg helped to open cervux from 3 to 6 cm.😁
And then her patience when our progress was little slow in last few hours. She waited and did every thing possible for natural delivery. With experience. Please follow what she says whether its normal or csection delivery she knows whats right for your baby and you.
Special thanks to dr neha and team. Who focus first on healthy baby and then way of delivery.. This way i also never thought.
With my experience i have never encountered a dr who is so polite ad ready to go extra mile. I was wondering how come every one at rainbow so polite and ready to raise bar. Thanks to love from admin. All nurses from labor staff. Admin neha. Floor manager.. Housrkeeping staff. Food staff. Security folks.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"Hello Everyone,

Quite elated to announce the natural birth of our baby boy on 15th morning. Sorry for the long message but I think the story needs to be told. So the search for best gynaecologists in South Delhi started as soon as we got to know that we have conceived. We preferred to go to doctors within 5-10 minute vicinity of our house, the doctors were good and quite reputed, however, I was never fully satisfied. Finally, we ended up our first consultation with Dr. Neha and soon after that I told my husband that I have finally found my doctor. From day 1, Dr. Neha focussed on the core issues:-
1. Proper Diet and not over eating
2. Exercises and Breathing
3. Timely development of the baby
Apart from the above, I can’t thank her enough for :-
1. Her problem solving approach
2. Approachability and promptness whenever you reach out to her.
My due date was 5th march, however, on 12th evening I noticed very slight water leakage. She asked to me go to the hospital in case it increases. 13th night I noticed the same thing so I contacted her on 14th early morning and she asked me to come for an immediate check up. During the check up, she asked me to get admitted. My husband got back home to get the hospital bag. On Valentine’s afternoon started the process of labour induction and she guided me well how to keep on walking, doing ball exercises and breathing during contractions which started around 4 pm and gradually progressed. Next morning she met me at 8 am and by that time I was quite exhausted and quite close to giving up. Dr. asked me if I wanted an epidural and I asked her to take a call as she knows the best. By this time I was only 3 cm dilated. She told me to bear the pain for 1-1.5 hours and then we can take  a call on that as epidural at that stage would only increase the labour time. That 1-1.5 hours though most difficult but was the most magical, I was fully dilated within that time. Dr. Neha immediately came for the delivery and encouraged me so much alongwith the right guidance that I was able to do it in 3 pushes. Not to forget she made me do full squats 5 minutes prior to delivery during contractions. 🤣 Thus, at 10.52 am on 15th morning, our lil champ was there with us and on 16th itself we were home, discharged- happy and healthy. :)

We are delighted to inform you all that we have been blessed with a healthy baby boy on 9th February 2022, and this was all possible because of Dr Neha.
I still remember, we took the home pregnancy test and it came out positive and the very next day I had mild spotting. In our anxiety, we googled, 'the best gynaecologist in Delhi' and as the destiny would have it, we were sitting with Dr Neha that very day. Since that day, she has handled our case with utmost care and that kept reinforcing our faith in her.
Gradually, as the pregnancy progressed, the guidelines, suggestions, diet chart, exercises, medication were explained to us in great detail very patiently by her in each and every visit.
In my 35th week scan, we found our baby to be in breech position. We were suggested by people to take second opinion... But, we were firm in not approaching any second doctor and, Dr. Neha didn't let us lose hope and suggested some brilliant exercises. By 37th week, the baby was in head down position.. and believe me, Dr Neha seemed to be the happiest person on the planet.
But, God had his own plans, despite all chances being in our favour, we had to go for C-section due to some complications. I had to call her up at 5:30 in the morning and was not sure if she would take the call.. but, she did and kept her team ready at the hospital.
Dr Neha, stood by us rock-solid, and was willing to give us as much time as we wanted for normal delivery, and kept reiterating that, the method doesn't matter, vaginally or surgically, the end result, our baby should come out safe and kept pushing us towards a normal delivery till the very end, when we had to opt for c section as the last resort.

Since it was my first pregnancy, I freaked out in the OT. And, Dr Neha kept pacifying me even during that time.
I guess I have bothered Dr Neha too many a times and I feel I am obsessed with the way she handled our case.
So, without taking much time.. I would like to extend a BIG THANKYOU TO DOCTOR NEHA. WE SHALL BE HIGHLY THANKFUL TO YOU TODAY, TOMORROW AND ALWAYS.",2022-02-12 17:41:22,False,True,Isha,Many thanks n god bless,2022-02-14T08:40:09+0000,Dr. Neha Khandelwal

Our parenthood journey started with Dr. Neha Khandelwal when I was in my 4th week (very early pregnancy) and she was with us throughout until my preterm labour. Our princess wanted to come a bit early in 34th week itself but through Dr.'s guidance, we could reach to 37th week and 1 day which was safe to deliver. Our lil angel came when it was totally unexpected and I had pre term contractions. With Dr. Neha's guidance, her team helped trace the unusual fluctuations in my baby's heartbeat and though she had pre planned a family event, she kept everything aside and was there with us to save my baby when we needed her the most. Trust me I was scared to see my angel's heartbeat fluctuations, but as soon as Dr.Neha Khandelwal arrived, it was quite a relief and from that very moment I knew my baby is all safe. Her team tried to get my baby delivered naturally but considering my situation, Dr. Neha suggested c sec without any delay to avoid any risk. Cant forget this when she told her family ""can't leave Priya in this situation"". I was falling short of words as the gratitude we have towards Dr. Neha can't be described in words and she is the first angel in our life who gifted us our lil princess.

Four months post that we came in contact with Dr. Neha Khandelwal ma’am. She not only helped us plan the next pregnancy but also guided us in conceiving within 5 months. I cannot thank ma’am enough for being so patient and positive, and for making us believe that this time around this pregnancy will end in good news. After conception, for the next 4 months I had severe vomitings, this was around the same time as the second wave of COVID. Even though physical examinations weren’t possible, she was always available on whatsapp and practo video calls. Ma’am not only understood where my anxiety was coming from but also never discouraged us from seeking frequent refuge in her advices. During our 5th month scan we got to know that my cervical length was shortening significantly, and without wasting even a single day, she guided us in taking proactive measure of getting a cerclage put in place the very next day. Ma’am accommodated us for a surgery with no prior notice and I remember her saying to me in the OT- ‘Together we’ll cruise through this and make sure you get a healthy baby at the end of this road.’ Her compassion is what sets her apart from all the other doctors. Post the cerclage we took the pregnancy two weeks at a time, making them our milestones. From 18th week, ma’am got us safely to 37 weeks 3 days; which is when we finally decided to deliver owing to my 8-10 vomitings a day. Again, after inducing labour pains twice for almost 10.5 hours, she accommodated us for a C- Section when Normal wasn’t working out. Ma’am came through with her promise at the end and on 20th November at 10:58 am I gave birth to my rainbow baby- a boy. I cannot ever thank Dr. Neha Khandelwal ma’am enough; for her compassion, kindness, expertise. What I can maybe strive to do, is honour her gift; my baby, and raise him to emulate all the qualities this miracle Doctor possesses. 

I know this is a long post, but every word I penned comes from heart, and moreover needs to be said to celebrate the selfless drive of our amazing doctor to send us home with a baby.

"Doctor friendliness,","Caesarean Section (C Section),",0,0,YES,"Hi everyone it's our pleasure to announce that we are blessed with baby boy on 3rd nov.morning under the guidance of Dr Neha Mam & her team.I am apologizing for the long msg but Neha mam deserves all the praise. I met Mam when I was 32week pregnant as we recently shifted our base back to delhi but after meeting her we were confident that we wanted to go with her. I was admitted on 2nd nov at 8:30pm as advised by Mam as I was 2days from entering week 41. So she advised to induce labour. After that I thought it will be a easy process & deliver normally. My cervix dilated to 9cm after the procedure by 3:30am.It was just a matter of last stage & push to deliver normally but i was drained & couldn't push properly. Mam waited till 5:30 (almost 2hrs) to deliver normally. But at the last moment we had to take a decision as baby's heart rate was changing drastically & we wouldn't wanted to risk anything. So went with c-sec & I then remembered mam's words when I met her for the first time,That it doesn't matter if it's normal or c sec, priority is always baby's health. And no Dr would forcefully for go c sec unless required. I got discharged after 3 days.So it's all in the mind.Also we have many pre conceived notions about delivery,one of them is about normal or c sec. After the experience i can say that it depends upon one's situation.Any decision should be based on baby & mother's health. It's a cliche line but yes you forget every pain when you hold your baby for the first time. Could really feel this line.
Also I would like to give special mention to Mam's team who equally encouraged me to bear the contraction pains & helped me to give that last try. Thank you Mam for your support & advise. As every new mom in the group says you are in safe hands with Dr Neha & today I can say & really mean it as well👍🏼😀Last few words for mom to be's - Please follow every lil thing instructed or advised by Mam as it really helps.All the best for your new birth😊👍🏼",2021-11-11 11:36:30,False,True,Meenal khivsara,Many thanks,2021-11-11T13:33:40+0000,Dr. Neha Khandelwal

With immense joy and pleasure I wanted to announce arrival of my lil princess on 5th Nov and all the credit goes to our one and only Dr. Neha.

Dr Neha,
Thank you for being such a dedicated and compassionate doctor you are! You always go above and beyond towards healthy outcome of your patients and I feel so blessed to have you as my doctor.
Doctor Neha is one of the proactive doctors I have ever met in my life.

So my water broke at home and that to on diwali night when everyone else was preparing for diwali puja incl. me😅 but my lil angel wanted to come on that night only. So after telling dr. about my water break she immediately called me and asked me to get admitted to the hospital right away as I was already 3 cm dilated in my last visit. She proactively shared my reports and summary in advance to her team so that there will be no delay. Her team induced pains and send each and every update to the doctor. Finally when the time came for the final push she made sure to be there with me for my delivery 1'o clock at night  just to ensure safe delivery. She work tirelessly in the hospital over that on the day of diwali when everyone wants to be at home, she  sacrificed her day and be with me. And on the top of that she got a patient like me with zero tolerance and patience, who did not cooperated with her while she was doing her task. Apologises for my behaviour during delivery.

Doctor like Neha are very rare to find. And I think we all are very fortunate to have her during our pregnancies.

At last many many thanks to you doctor to believe in me that I can deliver normally and if I can deliver normally then every who is under Dr. Neha's guidance can deliver normally if you listen to her advice properly. She can do wonders during your labour that you can't even think that you did this! ",2021-11-08 15:24:08,False,True,Aastha ,Many thanks and god bless,2021-11-09T09:38:06+0000,Dr. Neha Khandelwal

My friend 3 years ago had doctor Neha as her doctor for her delivery it was since then that I knew a good and trusted doctor. When we started our journey we went to rainbow for consultation, as soon as we were out my husband said ""she is our Dr."" One thing he always says the best abt her is she is cut to cut, the realties very well spoken and she will tell you to the extent you need to know. Our journey through these nine months was quite smooth. Before 38 weeks as my water broke I was completely panicked, called Dr. she examined and said to be admitted. I had always wanted a normal delivery was not very sure and was completely panicked and unprepared for this admit situation. If it had been any other doctor I don't know if she could bear with me for so long. For more than 15 hours of admission I did not have pain and was unsure if even normal delivery was possible. The next 6 hours in all the pain I had given up, I asked doctor to please operate and rif me off the pain and she said to just wait for next 2 hours. Doctor I don't remember much since the time you had said this as I think I was either asleep or unconscious with pain. She told my husband that I will do it.  That was her faith and patience.

And that way we brought a new life in the world and it was so natural birth. The entire team of rainbow from the nurses in the labour room to delivery to discharge and any other care they were there tirelessly to accompany you on your D day.

I cannot thank them less for bearing with my shouts in the labour room and delivery room.

Even post shifting to my room tirelessly the team would come and check if there was any requirement or any help. You can trust the entire team of rainbow. You are definitely in very safe hands and whatever is best as per your situation is what will be done for u.

Reading this currently may just be words but trust me, once it is your D day you would have a similar realisation.

I just realised I have written a lot to read so will stop here. You all just be sure that you are in the best hands and entirely trust Dr  for her decision.

I don't want to take any credit for this. I think it's just the way she is. She inspires faith n confidence in a way I haven't seen any doctor/guide does. I had an enjoyable n smooth 9 months thanks the reassurances, instructions, preventive treatment, query resolution etc. 

I must also share my experience of labour, I won't lie, it was the hardest thing I ever had to do but the faith in each decision Dr. Neha's was making n everything she was saying helped me sail through n have a normal delivery. She cared enough about my quick healing to make so much effort to convince, motivate n push me to deliver normally even when I was giving up. N waited patiently for the baby and me to be ready..N it all came from pure love n care for me..at that time I was dizzy n in pain but now when I look back, I feel so overwhelmed..i see how she brought everyone around (her team and my husband who was unsure I could/should deliver normally) to make it happen!

I must also mention two initiatives by her that she manages beyond call of duty:  a whatsaap community of all her pregnant patients n new mothers. And free thematic online sessions and QnAs on pregnancy related topics with experts every month. Both of these make the experience of pregnancy very different under Dr. Neha..

Till the end of the delivery she will keep trying that you go for a normal delivery even if sometimes patients lose their hope. In our case did the same but due to some  conditions we finally went for caesarean only but it was super quick and professionally handled. 
Thank you so much Dr Neha for being there for us as a doctor, a friend and a mentor.
For those who just got in touch with Dr Neha, I would like to inform you guys that you have come to the perfect place, now sit back and follow her instructions. May god bless you and shower loads of blessings on you and your Hi everyone,

She just didn’t make the delivery successful but also took care of our comfort and child and mother’s health and safety. We were super stressed because of this COVID situation but the grace of god and help of Dr Neha everything went smoothly. 

Till the end of the delivery she will keep trying that you go for a normal delivery even if sometimes patients lose their hope. In our case did the same but due to some  conditions we finally went for caesarean only but it was super quick and professionally handled. 

Thank you so much Dr Neha for being there for us as a doctor, a friend and a mentor.

For those who just got in touch with Dr Neha, I would like to inform you guys that you have come to the perfect place, now sit back and follow her instructions. May god bless you and shower loads of blessings on you and your family. 
Thanks again Dr Neha

"Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,","Female Sexual Problems,Gynae Problems,",0,0,NO,"After reading all the good reviews, I booked an appointment.  I came to the doctor's appointment with much detailed explanation of how I was tired and how i was experiencing discomfort.

What was a miss was that the doctor wasn't listening but rather dismissing every concern on the counter question of  whether what i was experiencing was 'pain' or 'discomfort'. this questiin was posed with no explanation of what might the difference in her educated opinion between the two be or whether discomfort did not include ppain.i also insisted that my energy levels were low and this shouldn't be for half a month but the comment frok the doctor that I received was that PMS is common for 15 days.  To me that was odd as she meant half a year could be PMS and it was normal to be energy less. 

Surprisingly, and rather confidently, the doctor told me to get a ultrasound done, upon my constant persistence, as to her all my symptoms (which were detailed) seemed normal and it was only  as i insisted i got the condescending ultrasound option, if I must for 'my own mental satisfaction'.

Thankfully I believed my body and I didn't listen ** *** *** ****** as I guess the doctor wasn't listening but just giving me her 10 minutes for a good hefty fees. ***** ** *********** ***** **** ****** ****** ********* **** ******* ** ******** *** **** ******** ****** *** ** ****** *** ** ** **** ** *** ****** ****** 

Its of no use if you pay such high consultation fees and the doctor cannot hear you out properly for 5 minutes without the condescending 'if you must for your own mental satisfaction'.  Isnt coming to a doctor a step towards that? 

I would therefore disagree with the experience and would say the consultation was rather a bad choice.",2021-03-12 13:34:54,False,False,Kritika,"Sorry about your experience .
But to clarify , anything that falls under PMS can definitely last for 15 days a month as per internationally accepted definitions and data . As per all international guidelines - FOGSI , ACOG and RCOG , PMS does not warrant any investigations .
My practice was absolutely in accordance with that .
No doctor practices to declare patients healthy in case they have a disease . But if a doctor feels that the patient does not have a disease , she has a right to say so . Prescribing investigations that are not required is a practice supported not by medical ethics .
 More than money for any doctor , what matters is  the satisfaction of treating people as per correct guidelines .
I had given you enough time and asked at the end if you have any more questions . the reader may note that over 200 patients and more than 99 percent have specified that my response time even to messages is very very less and that they were satisfied with the time given to them . So this is a false allegation . Also , the reader may note that my fees is clearly mentioned on the practo app and i have not charged anything extra at all . Before booking the appointment the patient must have noted the fees . Also the said patient had rebooked an appointment with me after over 15 days . if she was so unhappy , i dont understand the reason behind rebooking the appointment .",2021-03-14T05:11:48+0000,Dr. Neha Khandelwal

I am blessed with a sweet baby girl on 4th March and I had a normal delivery ! I want to share my experience.

When I came to know I was pregnant I started searching for a doctor who would have years of experience.  After visiting three doctors finally we had  chosen one of the most popular doctors and the journey started. 

I was keeping in  touch with that doctor till my 30th  week. 
But a kind of dissatisfaction inside my mind was going on with that doctor due to some reasons. 
Then I finally made up my mind to change the doctor. 

Through the reference of my friends I saw Dr. Neha on my 30th week. I had the following complication..

1. baby underweight at 30th week,
 
2. at the time of my internal examination I came to know that I had a small pelvis

3. at the time of labour pain through induction baby passed meconium.

Dr Neha firstly improved my diet,  and for small pelvis she advised me to do pelvic Massage, Squats mopping and other exercises .
 Because of Dr Neha my delivery is so smooth. She supported me as a sister. I am very thankful to her for my lifetime.
 My advise to everyone
Choosing a good doctor is more important in Pregnancy.  A doctor who gives you time, having patience to hear your problems, gives you  mental support, builds your confidence,  attends your calls , replies to your messages , clears your doubt, .. I found every thing I neededin this journey in Dr. Neha. Her zoom sessions are very useful and I was not getting from my previous Doctor.

 Dr. Neha guided me about exercises in my OPD visits.  One more thing I like she emphasises on natural foods instead of food supplements. 

I request all  to be patient, follow all the instructions given by Dr. Neha.

I m really thankful to Dr. Neha for making this journey memorable for me and taking good care  during pregnancy as well as at the time of delivery. A Big thanks to you Neha mam.

My journey started with Dr. Neha from preconception counselling in Rosewalk (not sure if mam remembers 😅) and continued in Rainbow and now in Cloudnine. My entire pregnancy journey was very smooth and total credit goes to her. One thing in my life I always struggled was being consistent. But surprisingly I followed her to the 'T' right from preconception to the LDR room Delivery table. Never would I have thought that I have that strength that I can deliver normally. Here as well, more than me she believed in me that I can and supported, encouraged and motivated me throughout and here I am 🥰.
I will definitely vouch for Normal delivery as before discharge when your Superdoc says ""You can lead a normal life now"" will be like music to your ears and very surprising as well because one can do some daily chores as well. 
With this lovely journey ending, it feels a little sad knowing that probably I would not be able to meet her in future ☹️☹️.

In no time during first trimester scan it was discovered that I had a small cervix that needs a lot of care , medication  and on a serious note inside I was really scared , again Dr Neha didn’t leave any stone unturned to mange it making it utterly comfortable for us

I was diagnosed with FGR issues but under Doctor’s guidance our daughter was born healthy and with 3kgs weight. I would have delivered normally but my pain intolerance led to last minute c-section. Dr. Neha was there on her toes for us at midnight. Her team is incomparable they make you feel so much like a family. I had cried and hugged the nurses in labour while going through the pains. I can’t thank you enough. I know I am never going to change my Gynae for the whole of my life. Trust Dr. Neha blindly guys. She will fight for her patients and take stand for them like anything.

I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl recently, and mine was a natural delivery, something that I can’t believe even now. And the credit for the same goes entirely, and completely, to Doctor Neha 🙏🏻

I first met her about 2 years back and since then I haven’t visited any other doctor ever, for pretty obvious reasons.

Right since the very inception, Doctor Neha advised me to eat well, exercise well and not take unnecessary stress. In fact, when I first met her for my pregnancy checkup she told me that it’s going to be cakewalk. That confidence and support helped me immensely in dealing with all pregnancy related issues.

I had a satisfying birth experience, all thanks to Doctor Neha, and my only contribution in that was to try and sincerely pay heed to whatever she advised. So please trust me when I tell you that all that you have to do is to follow her advise, without question or doubt.

Not just that but I can’t emphasise enough upon just how much I appreciate the fact that despite being extremely busy, she is always accessible when ever you need to get in touch with her. And to top it all her calm, and when required stern demeanour, helped me a lot in keeping calm, and focus on what was important.

To sum it up, I and my husband can only extend endless thank you(s) to Doctor Neha. I sincerely wish to have a life long association with her.

"Doctor friendliness,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Hello everyone, I am extremely delighted to share that we had a healthy and beautiful child yesterday. Dr. Neha has been rock solid support for us right from the start. 

At the start we had searched  to find a doctor just to confirm if we were pregnant. After visiting her the 1st time, we were so comfortable that we didn’t look for anyone else and have been consulting her for everything right from day 1.

Everything was going great and we were all set for normal delivery but we got to know about a complication in form cerebral redistribution in the 36th week due to which Dr. Neha suggested for early delivery in 37th week. This condition also meant that chances for normal delivery was less.

Finally yesterday we first tried inducing for labor pains twice for normal delivery but nothing happened. When it didn’t occur we went ahead with c-section. Eventually during the operation, we realised that the cord had tied the baby’s neck twice. Had the labor pain induced and we would have proceeded for normal delivery, it would certainly have become more complicated.

I will just say have complete faith. Everything will turn out well. To be honest we were initially slightly worried about cerebral redistribution, early delivery and c-sec as all was great till 36th week. We did feel why all this now. But when we look back now, all was meant to have a safe and sound delivery. All is great now.

We are very happy to announce that we have been blessed with baby boy on 30th Sept’22 under the supervision of Dr Neha and team in Rainbow hospital, Malviya Nagar. From the day 1 she has been instrumental and clear with her ask that she wants us to not overthink, eat healthy, exercise daily, do not believe on outside knowledge (Specially googling) instead ask her directly. In addition to that she guided us to belive that each women can tend to have different signs and symptoms in this journey. Because we all women are grown with the mindset that this happened with my mother, sister, friends, etc that can also happen with us & I have my own best example/experience to share which nobody told me until I conceived and experienced myself that urine passing can have sleepless nights so this was a learning out of my experience. 

Lastly, we never had the history of any delivery from Dr Neha in our family and the day I conceived my husband and I started looking for a doctor and our gut feeling ended with Dr Neha & we feel very fortunate today. She has become like a family and anyday she can be ur doctor, teacher, sister and mother. As whenever we don’t follow she will scold you like a big sister, teacher and I had that many moments with her… Till today I have not seen any doctor emphasising on normal delivery rather than c section.
Thanks once again. We love you ❤️

This is a journey , I always remember , atleast in this life 😊
I still remember the day, when I first met with Dr Neha, with my heavy heart and long face, however just one meeting with this Doctor, who carries so much of positive aura, that my heart goes light, and face turned bright. From that initial day to this date, we share a bond, which is hard to build in such a changing world. It seems that Dr Neha doesn’t belong to this world, she is a fairy, who has so much dedication to her work and that’s too without any expectations. She never missed my any communications in distress, when being an expected mother who feels anxiety or some medical conditions, she always responded in prompt basis and act as your best buddy to resolve your crisis and leave you with a positive touch of life. I am blessed to get such an excellent doctor, who always makes you feel a delightful experience, which is a boon in the life of expected mothers. I can write for hours and still feels that it is more to come for such a nice, humble human being, however I am ending this note with a thank you and blessing from the core of my heart for her well being and prosperity.

We are pleased to announce the arrival of our little baby boy, Ekaksh!! Born on January 18, 2024, he has already brought so much happiness and joy into our lives.
My journey with Neha Ma’am started during the 5th month of my pregnancy, as earlier I was with another doctor.

She always motivated me for normal delivery, and with her support and priceless guidance, I was able to achieve that. Still, I can’t believe that I had a normal delivery.
I find Neha Ma'am's cool, collected approach to be one of her best qualities. She never rushes to a conclusion without listening to her patients.
At last, I just wanted to thank her on behalf of the entire family. This world is blessed to have a doctor like you!!

On 27th of April, We were blessed by a baby boy.
It was a C section performed by Dr Neha.

I usually don’t share or like to talk about things but I really would like to mention this as my treatment was going somewhere else till the 32nd week of my pregnancy , if you can call it a grace of god or mother’s instinct we decided to get a second opinion just in case,as our hospital was in gurgaon and we live in delhi.

Dr Neha not only took my case at the very last minute, she went through every single detail thoroughly, she scrutinised each and every report for my current pregnancy and the last one.

If she wouldn’t have gone about it so extensively we wouldn’t have noticed some major complications that had arisen in the last trimester.

She not only evaluated my situation on time but also kept a very close check devoting her own time into it.

Nowadays it’s very rare to see doctors doing that.

Also it’s ensured that everything from the birth of our child to our discharge was seamless.

I would just like to say thank you Dr Neha for everything, Can’t thank you enough🤍✨",2023-05-01 11:17:00,False,True,Verified Patient,God bless,2023-05-01T12:41:11+0000,Dr. Neha Khandelwal

The best thing is her easy availability on what’s app and calls gives us confidence and assurance at every minute of pregnancy.

She always motivated us by telling that we are doing good which helped us to be more active and follow whatever she guide us.  It took me more than two hours in labor room to push the baby out and she was there to help me, motivate me and when i was not able to do so and giving up in between she’s the one who saved me and my baby. It was difficult time for us and my family but the miracle happened with the grace of god and Dr. Neha. Her motive is to bring out the healthy baby only. Vaginal delivery is far better than cesarean.

While we’ve been anticipating her arrival for many months, we couldn’t even imagine the amount of joy she’d bring us!
And a big (big) chunk of that joy we’d dedicate to Dr.Neha.

From the day we first met her, she’s been our rock- through the initial days of worry, not knowing what to do or how to care for the baby’s well-being, till the day she was in our arms- she patiently guided us through our journey to becoming new parents. 

What we love about her is how she basically mothered us through the process- telling us what to eat(and more importantly, what NOT to), how to care for the health of the mother and the baby alike, and how to keep our calm through the journey. 

And she has always(always!) been available to answer our queries, no matter how silly they seemed.

Even when the going got tough, and we had to make quick decisions, it seemed so easy after it had Docs nod of approval. 
(And I cannot stress enough how much that meant to us.)

We are forever indebted to Doc for all her support, dedication and care she’s given us these past months. We hope many more parents(-to-be) are blessed to receive her guidance and care through their pregnancy.

Hello Everyone 

I have been blessed with a baby girl on 11th of March. I would like to thank Neha Ma’am for all her guidance and support. She is not only an amazing doctor but  also a true mentor. 

I would also want to share my story- When i was pregnant I visited a different doctor for initial 20 weeks, however I didn’t feel comfortable with her. After a lot of research me and my husband came to doctor Neha in the 22nd week and we were were influenced by her in the first visit. She patiently listened to all our questions and made us feel very comfortable. She was all ears to my problems and concerns. After visiting her we were 100% sure that we are in safe hands. Without any second thoughts Dr Neha has my highest recommendation. Please follow her advice and trust me you will do well. I was also sceptical about Normal delivery has i have very low tolerance for pain, Dr Neha patiently listened to me and made sure that i have the best experience of motherhood. 

She keeps a close eye on all her patients and makes sure that she is reachable at any given point of time. 

Neha Ma’am- I am falling short of words to thank you for your support and guidance. We are lucky to have you by our side, You have been a fantastic doctor.

My due date was 1-Aug but due to rising BP, Dr. Neha asked immediately to get a c-sec as waiting might have resulted in unfortunate outcomes. We trusted her without any doubt and that truly paid off.
