Apart from long waiting time (1.5 hour) even after taking the appointment 2 days in advance the most disturbing thing was the behaviour of doctor. I took my mother for menopause complications she is having. The doctor at first listen and discussed the medical history of my mother then started scaring us of cervical cancer.. and pushing me to take the vaccine for cervical cancer which is available at her clinic. * ** * ******** ******* ** * ** **** ***** ** *** ********** *** ********** ***** ** ************ *********** ***** ******* ** ** *** ******* ** ** *** ********** *** ******** ******* Though the patient was my mother. The interesting part it, once you go to her clinic, her receptionist does not charge you before seeing the doctor. Instead she insists to first let the doctor examine you and then you can pay her. The catch is, that even though you are visiting the doctor for regular consultations she does this pap smear test. ***** ** ******** ** ** **** **** ** * ****** *** *** ****** **** ** **** ** *** **** *** **** *** *** ** ***** ** *** **** *** *** **** ******* ****** ********** **** *** ***** **** *** **** ***** **** **** *** *** ***** ***** **** ** ** ******* 4 days later we got the report in which she was negative for cervical cancer , however she had some infection in uterus. When we took the reports to doctor she scared by telling my mother on her face that cancer ho skta. This is what she said when she didn't even flip the page of the report to see the result. Though her receptionist prompted her that the report is negative but she continued to scare me and my mother and later got to me convincing to get vaccine from her clinic.\n",

Apart from long waiting time (1.5 hour) even after taking the appointment 2 days in advance the most disturbing thing was the behaviour of doctor. I took my mother for menopause complications she is having. The doctor at first listen and discussed the medical history of my mother then started scaring us of cervical cancer.. and pushing me to take the vaccine for cervical cancer which is available at her clinic. * ** * ******** ******* ** * ** **** ***** ** *** ********** *** ********** ***** ** ************ *********** ***** ******* ** ** *** ******* ** ** *** ********** *** ******** ******* Though the patient was my mother. The interesting part it, once you go to her clinic, her receptionist does not charge you before seeing the doctor. Instead she insists to first let the doctor examine you and then you can pay her. The catch is, that even though you are visiting the doctor for regular consultations she does this pap smear test. ***** ** ******** ** ** **** **** ** * ****** *** *** ****** **** ** **** ** *** **** *** **** *** *** ** ***** ** *** **** *** *** **** ******* ****** ********** **** *** ***** **** *** **** ***** **** **** *** *** ***** ***** **** ** ** ******* 4 days later we got the report in which she was negative for cervical cancer , however she had some infection in uterus. When we took the reports to doctor she scared by telling my mother on her face that cancer ho skta. This is what she said when she didn't even flip the page of the report to see the result. Though her receptionist prompted her that the report is negative but she continued to scare me and my mother and later got to me convincing to get vaccine from her clinic.\n",
