She ensured that she brought in required additional consultants where needed and went out of her way to get inputs from many other senior doctors for us to help understand the situation and chose a path forward. She is a fabulous person always worried about the patients well-being and progress. An amazing doctor to help during a very complicated phase of our journey. Can\u2019t thank you enough Doc.

I also felt body shamed (also had my arm and belly jiggled casually by doctor, which I found disconcerting), and the entire approach was that of, \"lose weight, eat less and everything will be alright\" ******* ** ********** ****** ** * ******* **** *** ** ******* ***** ****** *** ********* Said approach can be problematic as real problems may be dismissed and never brought to light, especially in a country such as India where fear and taboo exists around consulting gyanecs unless one is pregnant.

She was approachable and friendly, articulate. The office was hygienic and so was the examination. \n\nThe reason I would not recommend her based on my experience, would be that I did not receive any clear information or treatment besides what's already available online on fora on the issue I consulted the doctor for. I also felt body shamed (also had my arm and belly jiggled casually by doctor, which I found disconcerting), and the entire approach was that of, \"lose weight, eat less and everything will be alright\" ******* ** ********** ****** ** * ******* **** *** ** ******* ***** ****** *** ********* Said approach can be problematic as real problems may be dismissed and never brought to light, especially in a country such as India where fear and taboo exists around consulting gyanecs unless one is pregnant.
