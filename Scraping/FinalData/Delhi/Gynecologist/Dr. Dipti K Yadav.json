Initially, I was worried about a lot many things but the way she explained took all my worries away. She never called me for unnecessary visits. She never prescribed any unnecessary tests or ultrasounds. Moreover, she never told me to get it done from a certain place only which usually doctors do. She is always available on calls and on wats app also. She replies promptly. She thinks of all the pros and cons before prescribing any medicine. I went for the check up and just by looking at me.. she told me what would be the impression of the ultrasound. Her experience speaks volumes about her hard work. She is the only reason that I visit VENKATESHWAR HOSPITAL after having an awful experience with their cardiology department and emergency section. This I am writing after an experience of about 8 months. Due to her constant support and guidance, all my risk factors are under control now. I strongly recommend her for all the women who are planning to start a family and want to have a hassle free pregnancy period. Thank you so much ma'am for being so observant and understanding. ",

She identified my other health issues and after carefully observing all my reports, recommended another speciality as it was getting out of her area of practice. She explained everything clearly, suggested me to get video consultation as I live in Assam so it's impossible to travel for future consultations. She devoted a lot of time explaining each medicine, was friendly, and didn't give unnecessary medications. She's a gem of a person and I would highly recommend her. Thank you so much Doctor!",

She took great care of mine and always  advising me proper medication diet . As  I was nearing my due date her concern towards me also increased. Be it any side effects or any sort of discomforts she was always there for me.Really she\u2019s a wonderful doctor who has great dedication towards her profession. Both me and my husband are grateful to her. She ensured that our nine month journey was smooth.  \nMay god bless her.",

We were little scared due to this but she guided us well through the whole pregnancy and helped me through each stage, she advised with every possible care which is required to ensure that delivery goes smooth,she recommended few tests to ensure there are no complications later, there are many occasions where we repeated our queries but always got clear response from her without being annoyed to answer it again.\nEvery consultation, she thoroughly  examines and provide all necessary precautions which needs to be taken care. *** *** ***** ******* *********** *********** \n\nshe gave me full confidence and support through out my pregnancy with thyroid and IHCP  she guided me through proper channels and cleared all my confusions at time to time basis. the guidance from doctor had helped me alot to deliver a healthy baby normally .we trusted doctor's every decision and we are happy about it now.

Initially, I was worried about a lot many things but the way she explained took all my worries away. She never called me for unnecessary visits. She never prescribed any unnecessary tests or ultrasounds. Moreover, she never told me to get it done from a certain place only which usually doctors do. She is always available on calls and on wats app also. She replies promptly. She thinks of all the pros and cons before prescribing any medicine. I went for the check up and just by looking at me.. she told me what would be the impression of the ultrasound. Her experience speaks volumes about her hard work. She is the only reason that I visit VENKATESHWAR HOSPITAL after having an awful experience with their cardiology department and emergency section. This I am writing after an experience of about 8 months. Due to her constant support and guidance, all my risk factors are under control now. I strongly recommend her for all the women who are planning to start a family and want to have a hassle free pregnancy period. Thank you so much ma'am for being so observant and understanding. ",

She identified my other health issues and after carefully observing all my reports, recommended another speciality as it was getting out of her area of practice. She explained everything clearly, suggested me to get video consultation as I live in Assam so it's impossible to travel for future consultations. She devoted a lot of time explaining each medicine, was friendly, and didn't give unnecessary medications. She's a gem of a person and I would highly recommend her. Thank you so much Doctor!",

She took great care of mine and always  advising me proper medication diet . As  I was nearing my due date her concern towards me also increased. Be it any side effects or any sort of discomforts she was always there for me.Really she\u2019s a wonderful doctor who has great dedication towards her profession. Both me and my husband are grateful to her. She ensured that our nine month journey was smooth.  \nMay god bless her.",

K. Yadav. We were consulting her from beginning. During the pregnancy I was diagnosed with IHCP( a liver disease) . We were little scared due to this but she guided us well through the whole pregnancy and helped me through each stage, she advised with every possible care which is required to ensure that delivery goes smooth,she recommended few tests to ensure there are no complications later, there are many occasions where we repeated our queries but always got clear response from her without being annoyed to answer it again.\nEvery consultation, she thoroughly  examines and provide all necessary precautions which needs to be taken care. *** *** ***** ******* *********** *********** \n\nshe gave me full confidence and support through out my pregnancy with thyroid and IHCP  she guided me through proper channels and cleared all my confusions at time to time basis. the guidance from doctor had helped me alot to deliver a healthy baby normally .we trusted doctor's every decision and we are happy about it now.
