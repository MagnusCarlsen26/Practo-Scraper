My experience was really very good so inspite of relocating to Faridabad, we decided to consult her for my second pregnancy as well.  We consulted her for the entire 9 months of my second pregnancy. Considering the commute issues from Faridabad, she called us only when it was necessary and did video construction regularly when it was not required to meet in person. Happy to share that we are blessed with a healthy baby girl on Sep 29th, 2022 by normal delivery.She is the best Gynae I know.  Dr. Parinita is an outstanding doc. She not only listens everyone very patiently but also calmly explains the issues and resolutions.I am a mother of two Kids now and the way she handled my pregnancies was just superb. There were some issues in my second pregnancy but she managed them so well that they never bothered me much.Usually I have seen so many cases where patients want normal delivery but doctors threaten them and convince them to agree for c section. But as per my experience, Dr. Parinita prefers to do normal deliveries and tries her best till the end. I recommend everyone to consult her once to get best advice all the time..Love u Parinita Mam....Best Regards,Parul GuptaFaridabad",

This I advised in my prescription on your consultation day . I asked you to connect with me as soon as all test reports are available for further treatment and that will be free of any consultation fees. But you showed me next day only half of the  blood test and ultrasound test  yet to be done . So I again advised to complete all the tests, so that I can write proper treatment depending upon the reports and this consultation will be again for free .But you didn\u2019t reconnect .\nSo you unnecessarily wasted my time and effort\u2019s. If you still need help kindly follow up with all the reports as I have advised you, in my first prescription .That will be fruitful for you rather than writing all these wrong narrative .",

All thanks to the doc.\n\nAfter visiting several doctors with no results, I got to know about the doc through one of my friends... I remember the day I met her 20th March 2016, the day she said with firm belief.. So in next 3 months you have to conceive... I was a little surprised with her straight to the point attitude...but it was all worth it...as I conceived in next 4 months and gave birth to my beautiful little boy on 26 March 2017. What else can I write about her treatment.\n\nI truly believe she knows what and how to do...so well. ***** * ****** ** *** **** ***** *** *** **** ** **** *** ** ******** Me and my husband can't thank you enough as you made our dream come true. ***** **** *** *** *** **** ********* You make sure to keep boasting your patient.

Having a huge social circle and being a little tech savvy ourself, both me and my wife searched for good gynaecologists in East Delhi for days before zeroing down on Dr. Parinita. Though I was a little unsure because some online reviews gave negative views of her on-the-face attitude, but my wife and myself finally decided to go ahead and I am so glad we did.. From the day 1, Dr Parinita was a thorough professional who knew her job well and was more like a mentor to us in this critical journey. Not once did we even think of for second opinions . This was because her diagnosis and advises were always so bang-on and understandable. Finally she brought our little boy to this world through all hardships (my wife also suffered from chikunguniya during this time and we had a breach baby with cord around neck) with everything so perfectly done. There are no words to express our gratitude towards her. We definitely look forward to getting our next baby also delivered through her. Thank you Dr. Parinita!!\n-From entire Chawla family",

It was our second pregnancy and like all new couples we were unsure whom should we trust for taking care of unborn bundle of joy. In this case I was admitted in hospital in first trimester for threatened abortion and you saved the life of my son, then things moved well. On 25.02.20 due to severe pain I was again admitted in hospital and I gave birth of preterm baby boy in 32 weeks. During my labour pain and delivery, you gave me confidence for normal delivery which was very much required at that time. All these things happen suddenly My husband called her around 3.55 PM on her personal number and she told him to bring me in Max Healthcare. She admitted me immediately and my son was born on 6.46 PM. It is pertinent to mention here that my first baby was born through C Section but under the supervision of Dr Parinita Kalita mam my second baby born with normal delivery. she is a perfectionist who has dealt everything with utmost brilliance. Thanks a lot Ma'am for your support and suggestions throughout my Pregnancy. It was a blessing knowing you. I wish you health, wealth and prosperity in your life. Sincere regards from my entire family. \n\nKumari Ritu & Abhishek",

Honestly, I was a little surprised by her to-the-point nature, because if I know little, everyone in this world is showing their teeth and doing their personal marketing some way or the other. And even though I was the one who researched and found her through the net (reviews and ratings ofcourse), I was a little taken aback by her different nature and I was not very keen to continue. But my wife was absolutely sure that Parinita was the Doctor who she wanted to stick to consult and associate with for her child birth.\n\nAnd thank GOD she decided that. Because everything since then has been a dream come true scenario where all that happened, happened as we wanted.\n\nA great personality, a truly remarkable doctor and above all, a gem of a person. Thats how we know Doctor Parinita Kalita.\n\nWe (Me, My Wife and our new-born Daughter) would like to THANK YOU for your constant support and your-unique-doctory-love that you shared with us. We wish you a great success ahead and hoping that many couples get to experience the amazing  that we did with you.\n\nYours sincerely,\nSarath (a proud Husband, and now a proud Father)",

My experience was really very good so inspite of relocating to Faridabad, we decided to consult her for my second pregnancy as well.  We consulted her for the entire 9 months of my second pregnancy. Considering the commute issues from Faridabad, she called us only when it was necessary and did video construction regularly when it was not required to meet in person. Happy to share that we are blessed with a healthy baby girl on Sep 29th, 2022 by normal delivery.She is the best Gynae I know.  Dr. Parinita is an outstanding doc. She not only listens everyone very patiently but also calmly explains the issues and resolutions.I am a mother of two Kids now and the way she handled my pregnancies was just superb. There were some issues in my second pregnancy but she managed them so well that they never bothered me much.Usually I have seen so many cases where patients want normal delivery but doctors threaten them and convince them to agree for c section. But as per my experience, Dr. Parinita prefers to do normal deliveries and tries her best till the end. I recommend everyone to consult her once to get best advice all the time..Love u Parinita Mam....Best Regards,Parul GuptaFaridabad",

Let me explain it for your knowledge, \nFor any treatment first step is to come to a diagnosis ie to find out the reason of your problem.For that ,in any online consultations we have to go for basic test and in your condition of missed periods even after using OCP , we have to go for basic blood test and ultrasound. This I advised in my prescription on your consultation day . I asked you to connect with me as soon as all test reports are available for further treatment and that will be free of any consultation fees. But you showed me next day only half of the  blood test and ultrasound test  yet to be done . So I again advised to complete all the tests, so that I can write proper treatment depending upon the reports and this consultation will be again for free .But you didn\u2019t reconnect .\nSo you unnecessarily wasted my time and effort\u2019s. If you still need help kindly follow up with all the reports as I have advised you, in my first prescription .That will be fruitful for you rather than writing all these wrong narrative .",

I was a little surprised with her straight to the point attitude...but it was all worth it...as I conceived in next 4 months and gave birth to my beautiful little boy on 26 March 2017. What else can I write about her treatment.\n\nI truly believe she knows what and how to do...so well. ***** * ****** ** *** **** ***** *** *** **** ** **** *** ** ******** Me and my husband can't thank you enough as you made our dream come true. ***** **** *** *** *** **** ********* You make sure to keep boasting your patient.

Having a huge social circle and being a little tech savvy ourself, both me and my wife searched for good gynaecologists in East Delhi for days before zeroing down on Dr. Parinita. Though I was a little unsure because some online reviews gave negative views of her on-the-face attitude, but my wife and myself finally decided to go ahead and I am so glad we did.. From the day 1, Dr Parinita was a thorough professional who knew her job well and was more like a mentor to us in this critical journey. Not once did we even think of for second opinions . This was because her diagnosis and advises were always so bang-on and understandable. Finally she brought our little boy to this world through all hardships (my wife also suffered from chikunguniya during this time and we had a breach baby with cord around neck) with everything so perfectly done. There are no words to express our gratitude towards her. We definitely look forward to getting our next baby also delivered through her. Thank you Dr. Parinita!!\n-From entire Chawla family",

It was our second pregnancy and like all new couples we were unsure whom should we trust for taking care of unborn bundle of joy. In this case I was admitted in hospital in first trimester for threatened abortion and you saved the life of my son, then things moved well. On 25.02.20 due to severe pain I was again admitted in hospital and I gave birth of preterm baby boy in 32 weeks. During my labour pain and delivery, you gave me confidence for normal delivery which was very much required at that time. All these things happen suddenly My husband called her around 3.55 PM on her personal number and she told him to bring me in Max Healthcare. She admitted me immediately and my son was born on 6.46 PM. It is pertinent to mention here that my first baby was born through C Section but under the supervision of Dr Parinita Kalita mam my second baby born with normal delivery. she is a perfectionist who has dealt everything with utmost brilliance. Thanks a lot Ma'am for your support and suggestions throughout my Pregnancy. It was a blessing knowing you. I wish you health, wealth and prosperity in your life. Sincere regards from my entire family. \n\nKumari Ritu & Abhishek",

Honestly, I was a little surprised by her to-the-point nature, because if I know little, everyone in this world is showing their teeth and doing their personal marketing some way or the other. And even though I was the one who researched and found her through the net (reviews and ratings ofcourse), I was a little taken aback by her different nature and I was not very keen to continue. But my wife was absolutely sure that Parinita was the Doctor who she wanted to stick to consult and associate with for her child birth.\n\nAnd thank GOD she decided that. Because everything since then has been a dream come true scenario where all that happened, happened as we wanted.\n\nA great personality, a truly remarkable doctor and above all, a gem of a person. Thats how we know Doctor Parinita Kalita.\n\nWe (Me, My Wife and our new-born Daughter) would like to THANK YOU for your constant support and your-unique-doctory-love that you shared with us. We wish you a great success ahead and hoping that many couples get to experience the amazing  that we did with you.\n\nYours sincerely,\nSarath (a proud Husband, and now a proud Father)",

I was pregnant and suffering from ICHP a very rare but critical complication which sometimes lead to stillbirth if not taken care of properly. The way she has handled the entire situation is commendable. I was scared initially but she has very calmly done it and blessed with a baby boy. Thank you so much madam. I will always be grateful to you. ",

I felt so inhibited by then I could not bring myself to speak about my other health issues. She squared me up with a couple more judgmental glances before I left. \n\nI hope she's reading this and understands that as long as sex is a personal choice. The only thing that matters is whether is it consensual or not - both within or outside marriage. A doctor's job is to advise and treat, not push her own skewed morality on the patient. \n\nAlso, found her to be pretty expensive for the dingy, overcrowded space she operates from. \n\nAVOID. ",

We never felt confused or lost to the treatment or consultation we were having with her.\n\nWe are amazed with her straight to the point and stay calm attitude which she carries in a best way. Although this time we have our first baby but I never found Chhavi in doubt of anything as she can easily reach ma'am for any advice anytime.\n\nOnce again thank you ma'am for extra-ordinary care and personal concern to us. Wish you all the luck in future and keep blessing patients like this only.\n\n- Oberoi Family",

The good thing I liked about Dr Parinita is not only she gave me confidence about the pregnancy process but also she suggested me to think positive/normal. It is through her guidance and support because of which my 9 months of my pregnancy went smooth without any issue. During my labour pain and delivery, she gave me confidence for normal delivery which was very much required that time. We are blessed with a healthy baby boy.

As this was our first child we wanted to have it normally. initially we had to do a lot of search as there are very few doctors who \nrecommend normal delivery and really pursue towards it instead of unnecessary c sec unless it is the only option and it ended on parinita mam. From the beginning to the end parinita mam not only counseled \nabout each and every step throughout pregnancy but also boosted my wife confidence. she does not recommend unnecessary tests, she kept every thing very simple and finally we are blessed with a baby girl delivered\nnormally on 08.04.2019. Thank you parinita mam for your kind support and guidance in this journey.\ndeepak and Shobha.  ",

However, we were concerned about normal delivery and she assured me that she will do the same, don\u2019t worry about that. She also guided my wife to do some exercises too.\n\nOn 14/6/2018 we were blessed with baby boy through NVD at Max. We become parents of a little prince and can\u2019t express our feeling of that time.\n\nMy wife and baby both are doing good at home now. So, thank you once again Mam for your care and exceptional work. My family and I will never forget what you've done for us.\n\nSincerely,\nRuby & Rajnikant\n",

Delivered a healthy baby boy a month back and in my heart, I know who I have to thank. The openness to discuss anything anytime, the fact that she's just a phonecall away, and not to miss that endearing smile are things that will make sure I keep troubling her in the near future. A great guide in disguise of a doctor!",

Understanding the Problem's root cause  & making them understand to a patient is perhaps the best art a doctor possess & you are not only best but Master in it. \nThe way you had taken care of us during my child birth was really more than a doctor can do for a patient. \nSpecially your building trust in process & explanation of each & every step was somewhere exception in medical line.\n\nLet me proudly say that in this era when Medical line has become almost a business still You type of Doctors are creating  your own mark by advising patient the best for him/her. \n\nThank you doctor for your consultancy & helping us . \n\nRegards,\n\nMadhukar",

The care you gave me was marvelous. I still remember your support during my labor pain; it was as equal as a mother\u2019s advice. I personally feel if you were not guiding me then I was not able to have my daughter with a normal delivery. \nYou\u2019re to the point attitude, advises & follow-up protocols admire me and my husband a lot. We were not aware about pre-pregnancy care, but your approach towards us and counselling was really commendable.\nIn short I must say I got a great personal consultant and an adviser for both family and health related issues.\nAs far as if I am recommending you then I must say my daughter is now 3 years old and now I am planning for another one, again only and only your supervision and advice.\nSincerely,\nPooja \n",
