While most of the doctors told me that my situation was such that there is a very little chance to continue with my pregnancy, Dr Hirday handled my case very well. Not only i delivered a healthy baby, but i delivered my daughter vaginally(since she always pushed me to prefer vaginal delivery than caesarean). Meeting her has been God\u2019s blessing for me. She is extremely kind and sweet. Always have a smiling face and available on call whenever required.\n\nWish the best for her always!",
