She is a delight.. she made me and my husband so comfortable with the entire process. I don\u2019t think I could enjoy my pregnancy and have a normal delivery if it was not her. She is very reasonable and does not recommend anything which is not required. I totally recommend her to every women who wants to enjoy their pregnancy and have a doctor like friend and mother.",

She helped allay our anxiety as the D-Day was near and she did successfully conduct normal delivery this time. She has been such a blessing for us and would definitely recommend others to visit her.",
