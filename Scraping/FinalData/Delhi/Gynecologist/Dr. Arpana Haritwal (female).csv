,,0,0,YES,"Consulted Dr. Arpana Haritwal for gynecological issues of my wife,  at Max Smart Hospital, Saket.  Starting from our very 1st interaction with her, there was a feeling of being in safe hands.  Dr. Haritwal possesses a very loving personality. Her smiling face and the warm interaction she had with us are highly commendable. She suggested for Robotic  Hysterectomy Surgery and explained everything clearly and made us feel comfortable. The surgery went smoothly, and she showed a lot of skill. After the surgery, she gave helpful advice for a quick recovery and answered all our questions. Very professional yet kind, sweet and supportive.

Our decision for  Robotic Hysterectomy suggested by Dr. Arpana Haritwal was a wise decision  and the patient  is  on the way of recovery and doing  pretty well. The entire process from our initial consultation  through treatment was characterized by professionalism and empathy.  Would highly recommend her to  anyone needing a caring  and skilled  Gynecologist.  Thanks  to her and the  hospital team for taking such good care of us.
