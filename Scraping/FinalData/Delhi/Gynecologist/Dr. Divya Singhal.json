She is a very calm , sweet, ************* and soft spoken doctor. She makes sure that the patient gets attended with the utmost care and he/she gets fully satisfied with his / her questions. She took every measure to make sure baby as well as the mother is fine all the time. She also suggests various doctors, physio which mothers need for normal delivery.  She does not believe in operation as her first preference is of normal delievery till last hope she makes sure that mother gets normal delievery. Not only her but her assistant Meenu as well is very co-operative and very knowledgeable. She is also very supportive and is available all the time. She always have a smile on her face. Overall the exeprience was superb and I  highly recommend Dr. Divya singhal. ",

She doesn't treat u like a patient, rather she takes care of you like a mother n guides u the same way all the time, she makes you feel so comfortable whenever u visit her at her clinic for regular check up n follow ups, and the same way over the phone. I would say she is the best Gynaecologist/ Obstretician in the whole Delhi & NCR. I would recommend each & everyone to visit her if the want the bestest treatment. Thanks to her for giving me two beautiful gems.",

She took every measure to make sure baby as well as the mother is fine all the time. She also suggests various doctors, physio which mothers need for normal delivery.  She does not believe in operation as her first preference is of normal delievery till last hope she makes sure that mother gets normal delievery. Not only her but her assistant Meenu as well is very co-operative and very knowledgeable. She is also very supportive and is available all the time. She always have a smile on her face.

She doesn't treat u like a patient, rather she takes care of you like a mother n guides u the same way all the time, she makes you feel so comfortable whenever u visit her at her clinic for regular check up n follow ups, and the same way over the phone. I would say she is the best Gynaecologist/ Obstretician in the whole Delhi & NCR. I would recommend each & everyone to visit her if the want the bestest treatment. Thanks to her for giving me two beautiful gems.",

The ambience of the clinic is very tranquil and spot on hygienic. The staff is very friendly specially Meenu didi, she is very supportive and Keeps you in touch with doctor Divya in any emergency situation. I totally recommend her.",

I went to her clinic in May 2017 for my 1st pregnancy and with God's grace I have a healthy child, throughout journey was great - time to time updates, antenatal classes, vaccinations, information about labour and everything... She always suggested me home remedies for little problems during pregnancy, post pregnancy check ups, family planning suggestions.. I never thought of going anywhere.

I'm very happy and request you to come and trust the doctor. She is very nice amd supportive and the best part of the doctor is that she is not pecunious at all.\nThanks ",
