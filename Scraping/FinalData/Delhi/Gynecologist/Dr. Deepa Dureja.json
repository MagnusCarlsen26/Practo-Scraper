She is an expert in her field and her treatment really helped me get rid of the pain whereas other doctors couldn\u2019t help me.\nI strongly recommend Dr. Deepa if you are looking for a good gynaecologist who can help you out not only during the pregnancy/delivery phase but also with post pregnancy issues.",

She thoroughly explained the condition and the treatment plan, making sure I felt comfortable and informed every step of the way.\nNot only that, she also created a safe and non-judgmental environment, which was crucial for addressing such a sensitive issue. Her approach was holistic, combining medical treatment with practical exercises. I felt listened to and respected throughout the process.\nThanks to her treatment , I have made significant progress and now feel confident and pain-free.\nI highly recommend Dr. Deepa Dureja to anyone dealing with vaginismus.

She would not just be easily accessible for all my endless (at times naive) queries but would also encourage me to be positive. Discussing with her about my fears and apprehensions have always been reassuring and emotionally calming. She had been extremely patient and have helped us unpack all medical jargons so that we too understand every bit of the process. In short, she had provided complete personalised guidance throughout my pregnancy and have lastly ensured a smooth delivery and post natal care. I would definitely recommend her to all expecting mothers and women planning their pregnancy. ",

She is an expert in her field and her treatment really helped me get rid of the pain whereas other doctors couldn\u2019t help me.\nI strongly recommend Dr. Deepa if you are looking for a good gynaecologist who can help you out not only during the pregnancy/delivery phase but also with post pregnancy issues.",

She thoroughly explained the condition and the treatment plan, making sure I felt comfortable and informed every step of the way.\nNot only that, she also created a safe and non-judgmental environment, which was crucial for addressing such a sensitive issue. Her approach was holistic, combining medical treatment with practical exercises. I felt listened to and respected throughout the process.\nThanks to her treatment , I have made significant progress and now feel confident and pain-free.\nI highly recommend Dr. Deepa Dureja to anyone dealing with vaginismus.

She would not just be easily accessible for all my endless (at times naive) queries but would also encourage me to be positive. Discussing with her about my fears and apprehensions have always been reassuring and emotionally calming. She had been extremely patient and have helped us unpack all medical jargons so that we too understand every bit of the process. In short, she had provided complete personalised guidance throughout my pregnancy and have lastly ensured a smooth delivery and post natal care. I would definitely recommend her to all expecting mothers and women planning their pregnancy. ",
