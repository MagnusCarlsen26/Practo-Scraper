It was Dr, Leena Sridhar we had consulted all through our first pregnancy and we welcomed our daughter through a C-Section on July 11, 2021. After delivery her periods were regular but after 10 months she suffered with intense bleeding with clots, we immediately went to Dr. Leena and explained the status and she briefly mentioned about the hormonal changes that occur after pregnancy and also recommended to get few tests done along with ultrasound. On June 6, 2022, we showed the reports to Dr. Leena Sreedhar and she stuck to her diagnosis that it was a hormonal issue and treatable. Again, my wife asked for the pregnancy doubt, mentioned clots on which she mentioned that no it is because of the hormonal issues and all the reports are clear. She prescribed to continue the medication for hormonal issue only and visit again once the bleeding stops. But it didn’t stop despite taking the medicines. Trusting our doctor, we stayed on the medicines she had given us and while on the grounds the bleeding never stopped (spotting one day and heavy bleeding other days). But it was when we went a weekend trip to Jaipur, things started becoming more and more troublesome. My wife started suffering from more and more bleeding including the clots during the journey, but by the time we reached Jaipur, it had stopped, and we decided to wait for the night to see if it returned. Thankfully, the night went by somehow and the next morning, we immediately decided to head back to Delhi and visit Dr. Leena since the situation seemed abnormal. 
However, the next few hours turned out to be absolute nightmare to us, my wife had started bleeding profusely, and we rushed back towards delhi, however my wife had started to go unconcious due to all this bleeding and had it not been our extreme good luck of finding *** **** hospital nearby, my wife would have been dead. We had tried calling and sending pictures to her on whatsapp but her response was cold and not helpful at all. *** ***** ******* ********* **** ** **** ** ***** ** ***** ** *** ****** ** ********

She came as a rescuer for me and enabled me to convert my high risk pregnancy at 39 years age to a low risk normal delivery.

She is straight forward whether things are positive or not positive but her intentions are to always make things right for you and I was well disciplined and compliant to her suggestions. She and her team and Heena the assistant are well coordinated. The only thing i found missing was non availability of her contact number outside of hospital visit, in case of any urgent queries..
