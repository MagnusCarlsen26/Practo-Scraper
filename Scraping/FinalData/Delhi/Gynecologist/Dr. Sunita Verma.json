When I reached clinic doctor told me that you are booked for video consultation I checked and she was right. So, I asked her what is the solution Mam, She said I will cancel this appointment from my end and I am writing that patient asked to cancel and you will get your money back from Practo and you need to pay here at my clinic. I said fine. She said that she cancelled it by mentioning that patient asked to cancel and as discussed I paid 700 at her clinic. But I never got my money back from Practo aslo the app is adoring for my feedback for video consultation.\nHighly disappointed.\nPlease look into the matter and give my money back as son as possible.\nThank you\nMalika Sharma***********",

When I reached clinic doctor told me that you are booked for video consultation I checked and she was right. So, I asked her what is the solution Mam, She said I will cancel this appointment from my end and I am writing that patient asked to cancel and you will get your money back from Practo and you need to pay here at my clinic. I said fine. She said that she cancelled it by mentioning that patient asked to cancel and as discussed I paid 700 at her clinic. But I never got my money back from Practo aslo the app is adoring for my feedback for video consultation.\nHighly disappointed.\nPlease look into the matter and give my money back as son as possible.\nThank you\nMalika Sharma***********",
