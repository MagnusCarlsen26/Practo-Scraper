"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"While we were facing fertility issues and looking for a reliable gynecologist in Dwarka area we came across Dr. Yogita Parashar on Practo and decided to visit her. After a series of tests and treatments by her, we were able to conceive. However, our pregnancy journey was not very smooth and we faced issues like GDM, High BP, Low lying placenta, etc. but Dr. Yogita made us sail through all those rough patches smoothly. While I was in my 8th month, my BP suddenly shot to alarming levels and to our surprise, Dr. Yogita Parashar, responded on phone even in the wee hours of morning and advised us to get admitted immediately. This turned out to be the best advice at that time as in the hospital, my water broke unexpectedly and I started bleeding profusely. I had to undergo an emergency c-section and Dr. Yogita Parashar rushed to the hospital at 12 midnight on just a call. Thanks to her, today we are the happy parents of a baby boy. Had it not been for her, we even dread to think of what could have happened that night. Today we can say without an iota of doubt that Dr. Yogita is one of the best gynaecologists in Dwarka who is also a friend to the patients. It may also be added here that during lockdown, when quite a few doctors refused to see their patients, Dr. Yogita  provided consultation regularly, which was a big help for people like me who had a complicated pregnancy journey. We are really indebted to her and we highly recommend her especially for high risk pregnancies and infertility cases. Thank u so much Dr. Yogita ....",2020-08-05 20:46:08,False,True,Meghna Mukherjee,,,

Would not recommend.",2020-02-27 16:27:21,False,False,Verified Patient,"If a doctor is in hurry, we should be patient enough to understand that something urgent must be there....
