I was in desperate need for good guidance especially because I was only 4 months away from delivery. 

In our first meeting Dr. Anjali not only guided us about things expected for the fifth month, but also thoroughly monitored all my previous reports to make sure nothing essential is left undone. 

Throughout the process, she carefully guided me about the ideal diet, precautions and medication. 

Being a firm believer of natural methods, she always suggested home remedies first to improve my haemoglobin levels and baby's weight. 

Throughout the process she was just a call away which gave me the confidence that I was in safe and credible hands.

At the time of delivery too, we waited for circumstances to allow for normal vaginal delivery. I remained in early stage of labour for 24 hours without much progress in dilation of the cervix. Even at that stage she suggested that I wait for normal delivery but if I choose otherwise she will respect that choice which she did. 

I decided to go for a c section and she agreed immediately. 

Throughout the process of pregnancy and delivery I experienced her non judgemental attitude towards all my choices which is a rare thing to see. I found Dr. Anjali to be a thorough professional with an eye for detail and an immense ability to read through the technicalities. 

Most importantly, she was always polite and compassionate towards me like she must be with all her patients. This is especially important during pregnancy which is a very challenging time for any woman. 

Also, she always involved both me and my husband in all discussions and decisions, which was a thing missing with other doctors I visited.
