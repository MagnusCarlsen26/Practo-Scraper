"Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"


Nine months of pregnancy felt like a breeze, thanks to the outstanding efforts of everyone at Fortis lafemme specially Dr. Anita Gupta. I was very anxious patient and had done my research well before choosing Dr. Anita Gupta as my gynaecologist. Right from very first visit, I was very happy to have chosen Dr. Anita Gupta. The right amount of information at the right amount of time kept us at ease and relaxed, which was very important to us. Just the required tests and visits to make sure mom and baby were doing well. The modern and up-to-date practices made the whole experience enjoyable. And the best part was she was always a text away for all queries even at the odd hours. When it came to surgery, the care of Dr. Anita Gupta and Her team was the best of all. The  surgery was flawless and she brought us our little angel. I could not have asked for more. I would rate my experience with Dr. Anita Gupta at 20 on a scale of 10. I wish I had the words to thank her for an amazing birth experience. I’m indebted for life.
I would also like to mention the excellent quality and caring nature of all nurses. I have been working in the hospital industry for over a decade and I wouldn’t be bragging if I say nurses at fortis lafemme are an epitome of Nursing care,true to their profession. Right after admission, preparation for the OT and finally helping the new mother and handling the new born with the utmost care they will do it all with a smile. 
Overall , a great experience, i feel lucky and healthy.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Gynae Problems,High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Family Planning,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Anita Gupta was recommended to us by Google ** *** **** ** ** *** **** ************* ** ****** ** ***** ** *** ** *** ******* ** * I started visiting her a year back as me and my husband were trying to conceive through natural process. She was very professional and explained why it is important to get a checkup done before we start trying. We conceived through natural process with her guidance and booster medications. The pregnancy had some initial jitters but she always encouraged us to have a positive outlook and take ample bed rest. After initial couple of months, the pregnancy was stable and she was always available for any of our queries even in odd hours. I bothered her a lot with lots of first time parents questions and she was very patient and professional with us. Finally she delivered my baby girl, completely healthy, through c-section and the surgery was flawless. I recuperated as per the process and the hospital staff was also very friendly with us during the testing corona times as well. Also, she never asked us to get extra tests or ultrasounds done as most of the doctors in this time and age suggest. We had our regular tests in every trimester of the pregnancy and only the important USG scans.
I recommend Dr. Anita Gupta to every couple who is trying to bring a baby in this world as I liked her working methods which were neither too conventional nor too modern. We asked for results and she delivered. Her skill and experience reflect completely in her work. Thats what we ask for a gynaecologist. :)
