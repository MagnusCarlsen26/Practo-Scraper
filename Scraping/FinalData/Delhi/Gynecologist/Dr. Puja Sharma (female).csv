We are under consultation of Doctor Puja since 2019, earlier that year, we lost our first child after 12 days of her delivery, as she was suffering with a rare medical condition called TEF.

We strictly followed all the advises, medicines and tests as prescribed and last month we are blessed with a beautiful & healthy baby girl.
The second pregnancy was also very challenging as my wife had a RH-ve blood group and thyroid, also the c section surgery was also very tough due to previous conditions, she managed us to overcome all these challenges with her personal attention.
