From the very first meeting I could feel so much connected and comfortable with her. She listens to every tiny detail that the expecting parents want to share or the questions they want to ask and then responds to everything in a very calm, friendly and loving manner. I guess that\u2019s the most important thing that every pregnant woman looks for in her doctor. Also, she gives a very straightforward and clear advice, and will not misguide or please you just for the sake of money. Definitely recommend to everyone.",

She listens to every tiny detail that the expecting parents want to share or the questions they want to ask and then responds to everything in a very calm, friendly and loving manner. I guess that\u2019s the most important thing that every pregnant woman looks for in her doctor. Also, she gives a very straightforward and clear advice, and will not misguide or please you just for the sake of money. Definitely recommend to everyone.",

She helped me to have a little newborn princess who is our life. As a doctor, she always knew what has to be done right and as a lady, she knew how to give solutions to a pregnant lady who has her own dilemmas. If you need perfect guidance, she is the best person to approach and a doctor who is always ready to help you beyond your expectations. A big thanks to her but this would be a very small gesture to express my gratitude for her. I want to thank you from the core of my heart for being extremely supportive during these difficult times. I would like to tell you that you were so calm, sweet, loving, and caring. These qualities made me believe in you every day and I could trust you blindly.  In fact, you stood as a backbone during my tough time of pregnancy. Thank you for everything you did for me! You motivated and encouraged me every day. This helped me to overcome my fears easily.  Thanks a lot, ma'am for making my journey exceptionally great.  God bless you always. I will always count on you, ma\u2019am.",

We were apprehensive at first but all our queries were patiently handled by her in the first meeting itself and she gained our trust rather quickly. We were amazed by the round the clock support she provided including prompt response over calls and even whatsapp. She followed up with the treatment/tests herself proactively which further strengthened our trust that despite of the ongoing adverse situation, we were in good hands. Though the last 2 weeks of pregnancy  were really hard, with her constant support and guidance, we were able to sail through. We are still receiving post pregnancy care from her and would be forever grateful to her for her help to make our dream true of having a beautiful and healthy baby! We would recommend Dr. Pannam for the immense level of empathy and care received from her throughout the consultation.",

Because of her great knowledge and great smiles, we felt certain like we were in good hands and that gave us peace of mind towards the big day.\n\nIt was her remarkable experience and skill that could identify the potential complications that could have arisen and hence the delivery was planned at the right time. After suffering from infertility issues over last many years, we felt truly blessed to be under her and Dr. Arvind' care. Their team work has been very reassuring. \n\nWe were referred to her around 24th week by Dr. Arvind Vaid to take our care during the last stages of pregnancy with plans of delivery at Apollo Cradle, Moti Nagar. Their guidance and professionalism have brought a miracle into our lives after 10 years of marriage when we had lost all hopes.\n\nWe will forever be grateful to you!\n\nBest regards, \nDipti and Tarun",

Last five years my wife struggling with different medical issues and lastly we met with Dr.Pannam Sharma, she's incredible doctor. Not only she is taken great care of my wife health, but also lovely to speak with at every appointment. When you have an appointment, she will spend the whole scheduled period with you if need be;  We never feel rushed, and she's always asks if we have any other questions. It's rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding qualities of medical care. I especially loved how Dr.Pannam really took her time to explain my wife conditions with me as well as her treatment options. We had a great visit experience and the doctor\u2019s demeanor has really put us at ease so that I want to say that this is  best medical treatment experience of our life till date. We are really specially thanks to Dr.Pannam because in complete cycle of my wife treatment she was the one who guided us each & everthing (Admission to till Discharge). For treatment related queries I called her lots of time and she always responded. When she was busy, she would answer later & Clear all queries. she is a great doctor and the main thing is that she is a good humen being. She\u2019s very understanding and listens to your concerns. She takes time with the patient to help them with their health issues. ******* *** ****** ****",

We feel lucky to be referred to Dr Pannam who came as a blessing and  guided us from the moment we first met till delivery and still continues to do so. We were lucky to be in such good hands, Dr Pannam is not only courteous, affectionate, caring but not even for a single moment we ever felt we were interacting with someone who was not family for us. I still remember the first thing she mentioned \"in an exigency doesn't matter if it's 2 or 3am, don't hesitate just pick up the phone and call me\".\n\nWe used to msg her on WhatsApp knowing we will get a response asap. Despite her busy schedule we never faced any challenge in getting her attention. Even if she couldn't respond to the message there and then, she was always working in the background. In the hospital we texted her at the time of her OT, we didn't got a reply to our msg however we see 2 Dr's coming into our room sent by Dr Pannam from OT to check on the situation. Another gesture that goes the distance and tells how concerened Dr Pannam is for her patients. We were blessed with twin baby girls during Navratri on 22-Oct under kind observation of Dr Pannam.\n\nWe wish her good life, success, fortune and thanks from the bottom of our hearts.",

She suggested me to take some tests and as per those test we were able to successfully diagnose the reason behind me not able to get pregnant. She started with my treatment. She was not just available as a doctor but as a human being I have never met a doctor who is so much concerned for her patients. I have always felt very comfortable with her. She also guided me whenever needed. With her help I have successfully delivered my baby a week ago.

She is just a call away from her patients and can be approached at odd hours as well. Dr. Pannam put best of her efforts for well being of her patient. At 35 weeks of my pregnancy, I suffered oligohydramnios. It was her prompt decision/guidance that i was hospitalised and kept under observation for 24 hours. Dr. Pannam visited twice and was in touch over the phone as well. She made sure that hospital administration took good care of mine. Due to her efforts i delivered healthy baby. I shall be always grateful to her.",

On my initial visit she was incredibly thorough and detailed and I felt so confident in continuing my care with her. Due to Covid situation, I was advised for limited visits to clinic, however I had all my queries / concerns addressed as she was always available on phone / whatsapp.\nShe patiently answered our numerous questions, and thoroughly addressed all our concerns, never once making us feel rushed. In my visits leading up to delivery, she talked me through everything in a way that I could understand and even wrote things down which made it easier to explain to my husband who could not be at the appointment with me because of Covid.  I would strongly recommend her to any family and friend, without hesitation.  My husband and I are now proud parents of twins and are so grateful to have started our journey with Dr. Pannam.",
