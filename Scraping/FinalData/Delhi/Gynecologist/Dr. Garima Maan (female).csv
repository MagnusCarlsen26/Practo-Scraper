,,0,0,YES,"Our experience with Dr. Garima Maan has been very friendly, like a family member.  When we first went to her for the check-up, there were multiple questions, we were excited and at the same time bit anxious about the journey ahead. But she guided and built the trust so well that we started taking care of little things and got the right tests done at right time with her guidance. Though, both of us (me and my wife) have jobs located in cities away from Delhi but Garima ma'am was approachable all the time.  Her insightful diagnoses and patient-centered approach (seeing past history of medication) ensure comprehensive care. I strongly vouch for her and would recommend if you are looking for top notch care.",2024-06-07 13:32:19,False,True,user,,,
