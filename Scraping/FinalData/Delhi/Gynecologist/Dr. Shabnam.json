That time I was not mature enough but my mom took me almost every doctor in Haryana including Gurugram.\n\nAs everywhere I was prescribed the 21 days pills. Initially my weight was 60 kg but after taking these pills for 4 years, my weight went up-to 89 kg. So at-last I stopped these pills and again I was in the same situation with PCOS Symptoms.\n\nNo one told me What is PCOS, what is the difference between PCOD Vs PCOS. I was not even aware that Polycystic ovaries & PCOS is same.\n\nWhen I got admission in LLB, then I met many girls in my college who were suffering from bilateral Polycystic Ovary syndrome.\n\nThey suggested me to consult with Dr. SHABNAM, as Doctor Shabnam in Mehrauli, Delhi, is the best doctor for PCOS treatment.\n\nSo I visited Dr. SHABNAM in her Mehrauli, Clinic. She was the only doctor who explained me Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome or PCOS in Detail.\n\nI asked her for PCOS Cure. She explained me It can`t be cured but yes we can control this properly and lead a normal life.\n\nHer way of expaination was really very effective. She told me that I will not treat the PCOS Symptoms treatment but first lets find out how deep rooted it is by PCOS test then we will start our treatment.\n\nShe explained me about PCOS causes, PCOS & PCOD Meaning, Polycystic Ovary syndrome symptoms, What is PCOD & How to lose weight with PCOS.\n\nI took my treatment for 6 months from her and reduced my weight up-to 25 kg. I was feeling very good and Positive vibes in me.\n\nI followed her treatment the way she was guiding, as she said I will not only be your doctor but also your guide during these months.\n\nMy treatment included natural as well as medicines but not pills. She totally changed my life. now I am out of treatment from last 2 years and only following her natural treatment advice. I got married 2 years back and have a baby of 4 months.\n\nAll these credit goes to Dr. SHABNAM. ****** ******* ** ********* ****** *** **** ****** *** **** ********* * ***** **** **** ********* *** **********",

For few months a read about her a-lot.*** ***** *** *** **** ****** *** **** ********* ** ***** * **** ********* ****** ** ******\n\nThen I booked appointment and consulted her. On the very first consultation we were too much impressed.

She continued my treatment for 6 months. She helped me in every aspect of my life. She helped me to reduce my weight I lost my weight 25 kg during there months. She developed positive vibes in me.

Due to that, my periods were very disturbed. i was unable to conceive from last 4 years. i consulted many doctors during these 3 and half years but all of them gave me pills. I never got relief.\n\nOne of my office friends told me about Dr Shabnam[3] as the best PCOS Specialist in Delhi. She does PCOD Treatment and solutions very nicely.\n\nSo I consulted her. Her counselling session motivated me a lot. She is like a God to me. She explained to me everything about PCOS[4]. Her treatment is entirely different. It is natural as well as medicine. She really impressed me a lot for the first time.\n\nNow I am pregnant of 4 months first time in these 4 years, only due to the best PCOS Specialist Dr Shabnam.

That time I was not mature enough but my mom took me almost every doctor in Haryana including Gurugram.\n\nAs everywhere I was prescribed the 21 days pills. Initially my weight was 60 kg but after taking these pills for 4 years, my weight went up-to 89 kg. So at-last I stopped these pills and again I was in the same situation with PCOS Symptoms.\n\nNo one told me What is PCOS, what is the difference between PCOD Vs PCOS. I was not even aware that Polycystic ovaries & PCOS is same.\n\nWhen I got admission in LLB, then I met many girls in my college who were suffering from bilateral Polycystic Ovary syndrome.\n\nThey suggested me to consult with Dr. SHABNAM, as Doctor Shabnam in Mehrauli, Delhi, is the best doctor for PCOS treatment.\n\nSo I visited Dr. SHABNAM in her Mehrauli, Clinic. She was the only doctor who explained me Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome or PCOS in Detail.\n\nI asked her for PCOS Cure. She explained me It can`t be cured but yes we can control this properly and lead a normal life.\n\nHer way of expaination was really very effective. She told me that I will not treat the PCOS Symptoms treatment but first lets find out how deep rooted it is by PCOS test then we will start our treatment.\n\nShe explained me about PCOS causes, PCOS & PCOD Meaning, Polycystic Ovary syndrome symptoms, What is PCOD & How to lose weight with PCOS.\n\nI took my treatment for 6 months from her and reduced my weight up-to 25 kg. I was feeling very good and Positive vibes in me.\n\nI followed her treatment the way she was guiding, as she said I will not only be your doctor but also your guide during these months.\n\nMy treatment included natural as well as medicines but not pills. She totally changed my life. now I am out of treatment from last 2 years and only following her natural treatment advice. I got married 2 years back and have a baby of 4 months.\n\nAll these credit goes to Dr. SHABNAM. ****** ******* ** ********* ****** *** **** ****** *** **** ********* * ***** **** **** ********* *** **********",

So i took her online treatments initially, and then went to her clinic for once for physical chechi up. My treatment continued for almost 5 months and on 6 th month I got pregnant. It was a great experience for me and it was great effort of Dr Shabnam maam who made me feel such a nice experience. Now I am 4 months pregnant. Though I m consulting here in patna but still in touch with Dr Shabnam, as the satisfaction level I get from her, I never get from any doctor. Thanks maam",

At last we came to know about Dr Shabnam as a PCOS expert doctor, as she had treated one of my colleague's sister also. So we took her treatment. First she took some recent tests which were necessary. Then on next visit. She gave us such a good Counselling session about PCOS, in a very simple and easy language. We are really impressed the way she was handling our case, no one took that like this. After 6 months of treatment, now my wife is 8 weeks pregnant and we had our ultrasound done all are good.

She is a nice doctor who explains all the problems in such an easy language and counsels the patient so nicely. I very down to earth doctor. We are very happy with her treatment. Thanks mam for your valuable efforts. That worked for us 100%",

My wife was expecting and I was very nervous visiting any doctor as it was the first ever experience. But with God's grace, I was able to meet Dr. Shabnam and everything was executed well.\nShe never forces any treatment and leave on discretion of the patient to choose the line of treatment. \nI felt at home and my wife was able to discuss every bit of problem with ease like she was dealing with her friend.\n\nWould recommend every to be parents to visit atleast once.

You never said that you will do it from outside so plz dear do not misguide again to people who are really in need of proper treatment  for pcod.You bought many  tests from some local  lab which had so many corrections by pen. Yes I don't rely on those type of reports with multiple pen corrections from mohalla labs.  PCOD is not a fever that I give you medicine n you will be ok, it's test should be from Authentic labs not from local mohalla lab with pen corrections in it. So dear stop misguiding patients and tell the truth of your side also what misbehavior you did with doctor and clinic staff.. I hope you will apologize here .",
