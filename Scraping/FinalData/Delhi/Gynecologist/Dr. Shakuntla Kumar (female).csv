"Treatment satisfaction,","Gynae Problems,",0,0,YES,"Even though I booked my appointment about 2 days back, I had to wait for more than 2.5 hours. I reached the hospital on time for my appointment but they still made me wait for so long. I kept asking the receptionist and she kept assuring me that they will send me next but still they made me wait for more than 2.5 hours. They said that some meeting was going on which is very unprofessional in my opinion. If a slot is not available or if they are not sending in patients according to their appointment timings, they shouldn’t take appointments. I had some prior engagements which I had to cancel because of such a long waiting period. The most annoying part is that this hasn’t happened for the first time. The last time I booked an appointment through Practo and went to see the same doctor in Nulife Hospital, I had to wait for about 3 hours. I thought it was a one time thing, but this is unacceptable, it’s like they don’t value our time at all. Another point I would like to highlight is that the hospital is under construction and it is very dusty, sitting on the same chair for almost 3 hours while the dust keeps flying in the same area is really irritating. The doctor was nice and patiently diagnosed me, but I would not recommend this hospital at all.",2021-03-01 09:11:19,False,True,Prerna Chauhan,,,
