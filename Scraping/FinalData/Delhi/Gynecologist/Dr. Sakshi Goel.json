I was 49kg when I got pregnant and everyone told me that I will have a C-section delivery but trust me she was the only one who helped me throughout my pregnancy and prepared me for normal delivery. I had delivered my baby normally without any medicated relief procedure and I had her support throughout my pregnancy and also during labor . Apart from my mother she was the one on whom I relied completely.. I\u2019ll blindly suggest her to everyone looking for a good gynaecologist in Delhi especially when you want to have a normal delivery. Dr Sakshi I owe you my normal delivery \u2665\ufe0f and whenever God will bless me with second baby I shall come to you only no what in what corner of the world I will be \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f",
