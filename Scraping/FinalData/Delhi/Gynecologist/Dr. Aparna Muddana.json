But this was the best decision as Doctor Aparna was truly professional and more than that so friendly. My wife could instantly connect and everytime we consulted,we were assured of the best advise with a friendly smile. She took all the care throughout and finally we were blessed with a healthy baby boy. Even post delivery we are seeking her advise and the experience all throughout the past 5 months has been fantastic. A definite recommendation for anyone looking for the **** doctor with a personal and professional experience. ",

She took all the care throughout and finally we were blessed with a healthy baby boy. Even post delivery we are seeking her advise and the experience all throughout the past 5 months has been fantastic. A definite recommendation for anyone looking for the **** doctor with a personal and professional experience. ",
