Post my NT scan she prescribed iron and calcium tablets to me but did not mention the most vital technique of taking iron tablet with lime water before breakfast and calcium tablet atleast 3 hours later. Due to which for 1 month there was no iron absorption in my body or reaching my foetus. Highly unrecommended! ",2024-03-25 09:25:22,False,False,Shruti,,,

So, i told her all my concerns and she was not bothered at all and she just told baby is fine you can come next month. Then i told her i am gaining so much of weight please suggest me what should i do and She didn’t answer my question too.. i had no other option but to continue with her. everytime i went to her and told her concerns, she never answered.
