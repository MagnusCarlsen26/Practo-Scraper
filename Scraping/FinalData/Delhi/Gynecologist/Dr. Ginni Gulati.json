She is really knowledgeable and identified the cause of any problem before the Lab reports came. Only because of her extended support, my wife was detected with an un-usual infection, which all other Support Operation Doctors were rejecting, and she called special Surgeon from other hospital to treat it (I was in the OT at that time). She treats patients like her responsibility and go way beyond than expectations. I think it was the best-est decision of our life, that we chose Dr Ginni as Gynae for my wife. She never thought of time, Holidays, Her Own family and even she shown availability during a Death at home. What more we can expect for a Doctor. She is gem of a heart, polite and really nice human being. She's is the one never got irritated with our unwanted queries, questions and calls. She is now more of a Elder Sister to me and I will strongly recommend Dr Ginni to everyone, who needs a helping hand.",

I always afraid of having c section and preferred normal delivery and I am quiet sure that I would get normal delivery as the doctor always prefer and support it and give me  the tips to have normal delivery.

Only because of her extended support, my wife was detected with an un-usual infection, which all other Support Operation Doctors were rejecting, and she called special Surgeon from other hospital to treat it (I was in the OT at that time). She treats patients like her responsibility and go way beyond than expectations. I think it was the best-est decision of our life, that we chose Dr Ginni as Gynae for my wife. She never thought of time, Holidays, Her Own family and even she shown availability during a Death at home. What more we can expect for a Doctor. She is gem of a heart, polite and really nice human being. She's is the one never got irritated with our unwanted queries, questions and calls. She is now more of a Elder Sister to me and I will strongly recommend Dr Ginni to everyone, who needs a helping hand.",

She has got a plethora of home remedies and will resort to medicines only when actually required. She attends all her patients calls and if possible advises them over phone, saving them the hassle and time to come and visit avoiding Delhi's traffic. I consider myself lucky to have found her for my Pregnancy period.",
