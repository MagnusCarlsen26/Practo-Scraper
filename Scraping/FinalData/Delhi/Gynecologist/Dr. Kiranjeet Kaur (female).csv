Firstly, you and your wife came to me in the eighth month of pregnancy after changing your doctor twice. On your first visit a thorough/ detailed consultation was done and a care plan was made. On the second visit you were clearly counselled regarding plan of treatment and the professional charges involved. There was no further discussion regarding your aforesaid apprehensions.
