The third visit has been horrible. I have visited pulmonology dept. twice before which is great in organizing walkin/appointment of busiest docs but the exp with third vist to Manipal regarding consultation to cardiology dept (Dr Ranjan Shetty) is so bad that we had to wait for 3 hrs literally. They didn't take an appointment and called me to walk in on Sat which I did within 10 min. Walk-in is 1st come 1st serve basis.

"Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,","Heart Conditions,",0,0,NO,"I visited Manipal Hospital, old airport road, to consult a cardiologist as I was having chest pain. We waited for around 1 hour and 45 minutes for the doctor's consultation. (Which I didn't mind as a Cardiologist can have urgent engagements during the OP time). Upon entering the consultation room, doctor just asked if I had chest pain while walking, and when I said yes, he referred us to a TMT test. We came back to the doctor with the result, he just asked me to exercise regularly and consult him after a month. I felt this is fine for people of age 30-40 but I went there as my triglycerides where close to 700 and since I was taking medicines for other health conditions relating to heart health. Since I sensed doctor was in a hurry to get through the patients, I quickly informed him about the conditions and the lipid profile and triglycerides values which finally got his attention. Doctor, advised us for a CT Coronary Angiogram in a couple of days.
