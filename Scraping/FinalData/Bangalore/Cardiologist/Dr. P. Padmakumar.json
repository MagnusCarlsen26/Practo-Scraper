Being a Cardiac( heart) doctor regrettably he don't have good heart to listen to patient.\nHe is one of very arrogant doctor we have come across. We had previous Blood and other reports which was collected in other hospital, he denied to check other Hospital report and says through those old reports.He don't listen to patients and if you ask him any question, he straight fwd says don't ask any questions.He makes heart patient more tension by using hi-fi medical terminology and also Vikram Hospital diagnosis are very much expensive and doctor consultant change are very high. The attitude of doctor was very carefree,Patient lose there confidence and just want to come back home.\nHope this will be helpful for patient visiting Dr. P. Padmakumar.",

We had previous Blood and other reports which was collected in other hospital, he denied to check other Hospital report and says through those old reports.He don't listen to patients and if you ask him any question, he straight fwd says don't ask any questions.He makes heart patient more tension by using hi-fi medical terminology and also Vikram Hospital diagnosis are very much expensive and doctor consultant change are very high. The attitude of doctor was very carefree,Patient lose there confidence and just want to come back home.\nHope this will be helpful for patient visiting Dr. P. Padmakumar.",
