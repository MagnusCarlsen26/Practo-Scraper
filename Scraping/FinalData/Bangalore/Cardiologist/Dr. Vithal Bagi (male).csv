,,0,0,YES,"For both me and my family, this doc proves to be the best cardiologist we have ever consulted so far. He is detailed and accurate when it comes to his understanding of his patients health concerns. Calmly replies to all our queries and explains us about problem, medication and care.

Unlike the scary industry out there wherein doctor's dupe you for unnecessary tests and medications/surgery. Doctor Vithal Bagi, on the other hand simply ensures to prescribes us medicine or test only if it is extremely necessary. 

My dad had a CT scan which suggested the need for angioplasty. We were all set and got admitted. This was headed by Dr.Vithal. In the midst of Angiogram, Dr Vithal felt that there was no need for an angioplasty and could be managed with medicines and a surgery is not required. He called me and showed how the blockage looked like and why the procedure was not required. I was surprised to see this happening in current age where Doctors and hospitals are believed to encourage more and more surgeries. 

My dad has been his patient since 10 years and I am really indebted to him for the kind of treatment, the kind of positivity he gives us and for being always so approachable.

,,0,0,YES,"I met Dr. Vittal for my father's angioplasty and for my mother hypertensive  issues.  Of all the multiple doctors,  Dr. Vittal remains our favorite. For any one who has a family member/s with cardiac issues, the concerns and worries are always constant and high. A consultation with Dr. Vittal makes one feel relaxed and hopeful.  As a doctor, Dr. Vittal is well-versed with procedures and carries vast experinces in this field.  Dr. Vittal explains  procedures very patiently and to our understanding.  As a person, Dr. Vittal is very calm,  approachable, family-like and most importantly, available.  All the doctors can treat but few doctors can heal the patients and Dr. Vittal is one such. Strongly recommend Dr. Vittal for anyone having cardiac concerns.  I wish the doctor the very best .  ",2023-07-06 15:57:59,False,True,Rakshitha Rachana,,,
