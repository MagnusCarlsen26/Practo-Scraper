He also asked to stop taking a medicine which I was taking from a long time as it deemed unnecessary (unfortunately the previous doctor I checked failed to advise me the same so I continued taking the tablet for couple of years for no reason, & I regret it). I would advise anybody wanting to have a thorough conversation and cardiac check-up must visit this clinic.",2021-07-26 09:39:20,False,True,Bankim Thokchom,,,
