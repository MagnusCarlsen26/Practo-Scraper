The Doctors - Dr.Venkatesh S was very quick to diagnose the problem as Heart Failure and his treatment was instrumental in me coming out of a very critical condition. Dr.Venkatesh immediately did Angiogram and found that there were severe blockages and since my condition at that time was not that good, Dr.Venkatesh took a very right decision to treat me medically and allowed me enough time to gain strength to withstand heart bypass surgery. Later, I had an incident of irregular heart beats on 8th Feb 2023 and I immediately contacted Dr.Venkatesh S who was kind enough to give timely suggestion. I was then admitted to Aster RV and my pulse rate was first stabilized. Dr.Venkatesh never does anything unwantedly and his decisions are always backed by scientific evidence. I was then suggested a PET scan to check if my heart tissues are alive and only upon those findings, Dr.Venkatesh S suggested that heart bypass would be a good solution for my condition. Since my heart pumping was weak, Dr.Venkatesh S again using all his experience suggested to use IABP(Balloon) to take the load off my heart during surgery. This was a very critical decision and helped the Cardio-Thoracic Surgeon Dr.Divakar Bhat during the Surgery to control the heart. Dr.Venkatesh S is a very kind and approachable doctor who is always available to the patient and their attendants. He is methodical in his approach and never does anything unwantedly. He is a thorough gentleman and a great Cardiologist with excellent knowledge and a person with a touch of humanity. I will always be indebted to Dr.Venkatesh S for his great help to our family and he is a God Sent Angel to our family. Not only our case, we have seen so many patients and families being saved by his great acumen and skillset.\nDr.Venkatesh S also took a great decision of implanting ICD for my case which has the potential to be a life saver for patients like me. ICD Operation also was performed very well by his team.\nI owe my recovery to Dr.Venkatesh S. Entire Cardiology team is very hardworking and Dr.Venkatesh S is kind enough to take a call anytime of the day or night to help save lives.\nAster RV Hospital has the best Cardiology and Cardio-Thoracic team in the world and is on par with any of the best hospitals of the world. If you are looking for Cardiac Care with a human touch, then Aster RV is the place to go. ",

The Doctors - Dr.Venkatesh S was very quick to diagnose the problem as Heart Failure and his treatment was instrumental in me coming out of a very critical condition. Dr.Venkatesh immediately did Angiogram and found that there were severe blockages and since my condition at that time was not that good, Dr.Venkatesh took a very right decision to treat me medically and allowed me enough time to gain strength to withstand heart bypass surgery. Later, I had an incident of irregular heart beats on 8th Feb 2023 and I immediately contacted Dr.Venkatesh S who was kind enough to give timely suggestion. I was then admitted to Aster RV and my pulse rate was first stabilized. Dr.Venkatesh never does anything unwantedly and his decisions are always backed by scientific evidence. I was then suggested a PET scan to check if my heart tissues are alive and only upon those findings, Dr.Venkatesh S suggested that heart bypass would be a good solution for my condition. Since my heart pumping was weak, Dr.Venkatesh S again using all his experience suggested to use IABP(Balloon) to take the load off my heart during surgery. This was a very critical decision and helped the Cardio-Thoracic Surgeon Dr.Divakar Bhat during the Surgery to control the heart. Dr.Venkatesh S is a very kind and approachable doctor who is always available to the patient and their attendants. He is methodical in his approach and never does anything unwantedly. He is a thorough gentleman and a great Cardiologist with excellent knowledge and a person with a touch of humanity. I will always be indebted to Dr.Venkatesh S for his great help to our family and he is a God Sent Angel to our family. Not only our case, we have seen so many patients and families being saved by his great acumen and skillset.\nDr.Venkatesh S also took a great decision of implanting ICD for my case which has the potential to be a life saver for patients like me. ICD Operation also was performed very well by his team.\nI owe my recovery to Dr.Venkatesh S. Entire Cardiology team is very hardworking and Dr.Venkatesh S is kind enough to take a call anytime of the day or night to help save lives.\nAster RV Hospital has the best Cardiology and Cardio-Thoracic team in the world and is on par with any of the best hospitals of the world. If you are looking for Cardiac Care with a human touch, then Aster RV is the place to go. ",
