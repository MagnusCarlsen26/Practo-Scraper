                "review_text": "Since June 2021, I have been feeling constant heaviness/pressure in my left chest.  Before meeting Dr KP Srihari in Sept 2022, I had met other Cardiologists, and had got all the tests done such as Lipid profile, Echo, TMT etc. As per my Lipid profile report, I had high Triglycerides and low HDL. Also, my Echo indicated mild concentric LVH in my heart. As per doctor, LVH was because of high BP, and hence I was put on BP medicine(Olmezest 20mg, Proloment 12.5 XL). I was also prescribed Rozuvas F5 to treat my high triglycerides and low HDL. The BP medicine helped in bringing my BP from 150/100 to 120/80 and even lower. Also, my triglycerides went down from 350-400 to 100-110 in a few months of taking the medicine. However, the constant and irritating chest heaviness stayed as before. So, finally, I went through Coronary Angiogram also in Mar 2022, to rule out any blockage in my blood vessels; the report was negative. I also went through Gastro Endoscopy to find out if gas was causing the chest heaviness, but it was not the case either. The endoscopy indicated H Pylori infection my stomach, and I took treatment to clear the infection, but my chest heaviness was still there.\nSo I decided to change my Cardiologist; and based on one of my friend's recommendation, met Dr KP Srihari in Sep 2022. He went through my complete medical history very patiently and explained me the treatment plan. He got some basic tests such as Echo, TMT and Lipid profile done for me and told me not to worry about the chest heaviness. He advised me to continue with the BP and Triglyceride  medication, and to have an active and healthy lifestyle that includes daily exercise and yoga. Overall, I found the Doctor very knowledgeable and friendly. He explained me my condition without sugarcoating any fact, but at the same time ensured that I had a proper plan to help myself. During my multiple interactions with the Doctor, I always felt he was genuinely interested in improving patients health condition, and nothing else. I would highly recommend him to anyone having any heart related ailment(s).",

Being an otherwise athletic person, the fact that I had to take daily pills did not sit well with me. Most of my previous doctors in India, US and UK, had a very matter of fact approach, and to a young hypertension patient who loved to have a good life, it caused a lot of anxiety. 5 years back I consulted Dr Srihari Das. He has been very kind and patient and we have been working together to gradually bring down the daily dosage, and it has worked very well. He asks for further investigations like ECG and Echo only when really necessary and explains very well in layman terms for my understanding, whether the combination of medicine and daily diet and exercise routine has been working for the heart. We have also met him for my Mom\u2019s regular check-up. She is in her mid-70s and still operates without any medication of any kind. \n\nI will highly recommend Dr Das for any Cardiology related issues. He has an excellent clinic in Jayanagar where you can meet him if you cannot make it during the day time at the hospital. ",

Though it was a complete lockdown, the initial formalities took some time and I was taken inside. After checking my ECG report, I was diagnosed with major heart attack. Immediately, Cardiology team jumped into action and within no time block was treated with Angioplasty.** ****** ** * ******* *** ** *** *******  I believe those words after my life was saved by Dr.Srihari Das and his team.

He is so friendly and explains about our condition in a very simple way.He spends lot of time with his patients and listens to them patiently.I had a sever Virtigo problem and consulted him. He  patiently listened to the symptoms and  diagonised it as Virtigo . It was so sever that I was scared that it would be any other  serious problem as I was not aware that it was Virtigo. He gave me confidence and cheered me up. Dr.Srihari doesn't suggest tests unless it is actually required and doesn\u2019t prescribe excess medicines.\nHe gets connected with his patients and my experience with him is, any doubt, I drop him a Whatsapp message and he promptly responds to it in-spite of his busy schedule. Usually after the treatment, it is the patient who follows-up with the Doctor. But with Dr.Srihari, he takes too much care in his patients that he regularly follows up on how they are doing. I had taken my mother to him for her high BP. Every now and then, he keeps checking with me on her health. He is such a caring person. Half of the ailment gets cured by the amount of care he shows.\nThank you so much Dr. I am so lucky that I know you.\n",

What does a person expects if he's consulting a doctor- First the doctor to listen calmly, Second to initiate diagnosis immediately, Third to suggest treatment options explaining risks and benefits, Fourth to understand patient's pain and financial limitations and be cooperative and finally keeping patient informed of the health condition and progress. I found this all while my father was undergoing treatment under him. Apart from this:\n1. He's Expert in his field. He identified heart problem from looking into my father's ECG, while other doctors said its normal. My father was discharged in 24hrs.\n2. He's Experienced. He performed Angioplasty for three blockages in an hour without compromising with the treatment. Also, I was kept informed of the progress at regular intervals, so OT was not a black box for me.\n3. He's very Calm. He had as many conversations as and when I had to answer my queries.\n4. Friendly and understanding. He's very cooperative and helpful. In fact he reprioritized his schedule to accommodate my father's treatment understanding the severity.\n\nI'll recommend Dr. Sridhar Das if you're looking for a cardiologist.",

We went to Dr. Srihari Das at Narayana Multispecialty Hospital, HSR and I was positively surprised (and comforted) by his thorough professionalism and truly caring attitude. He checked thoroughly, asked good questions, listened really well (most doctors don't) and gave only minimum medication *** ** *********** ********** ****** I even mentioned doing Angiography but he told us clearly it was not required.\nI and my father were really comforted by his attitude of helping us (rather than helping the hospital at our cost - like most hospitals).

Before meeting Dr KP Srihari in Sept 2022, I had met other Cardiologists, and had got all the tests done such as Lipid profile, Echo, TMT etc. As per my Lipid profile report, I had high Triglycerides and low HDL. Also, my Echo indicated mild concentric LVH in my heart. As per doctor, LVH was because of high BP, and hence I was put on BP medicine(Olmezest 20mg, Proloment 12.5 XL). I was also prescribed Rozuvas F5 to treat my high triglycerides and low HDL. The BP medicine helped in bringing my BP from 150/100 to 120/80 and even lower. Also, my triglycerides went down from 350-400 to 100-110 in a few months of taking the medicine. However, the constant and irritating chest heaviness stayed as before. So, finally, I went through Coronary Angiogram also in Mar 2022, to rule out any blockage in my blood vessels; the report was negative. I also went through Gastro Endoscopy to find out if gas was causing the chest heaviness, but it was not the case either. The endoscopy indicated H Pylori infection my stomach, and I took treatment to clear the infection, but my chest heaviness was still there.\nSo I decided to change my Cardiologist; and based on one of my friend's recommendation, met Dr KP Srihari in Sep 2022. He went through my complete medical history very patiently and explained me the treatment plan. He got some basic tests such as Echo, TMT and Lipid profile done for me and told me not to worry about the chest heaviness. He advised me to continue with the BP and Triglyceride  medication, and to have an active and healthy lifestyle that includes daily exercise and yoga. Overall, I found the Doctor very knowledgeable and friendly. He explained me my condition without sugarcoating any fact, but at the same time ensured that I had a proper plan to help myself. During my multiple interactions with the Doctor, I always felt he was genuinely interested in improving patients health condition, and nothing else. I would highly recommend him to anyone having any heart related ailment(s).",

Being an otherwise athletic person, the fact that I had to take daily pills did not sit well with me. Most of my previous doctors in India, US and UK, had a very matter of fact approach, and to a young hypertension patient who loved to have a good life, it caused a lot of anxiety. 5 years back I consulted Dr Srihari Das. He has been very kind and patient and we have been working together to gradually bring down the daily dosage, and it has worked very well. He asks for further investigations like ECG and Echo only when really necessary and explains very well in layman terms for my understanding, whether the combination of medicine and daily diet and exercise routine has been working for the heart. We have also met him for my Mom\u2019s regular check-up. She is in her mid-70s and still operates without any medication of any kind. \n\nI will highly recommend Dr Das for any Cardiology related issues. He has an excellent clinic in Jayanagar where you can meet him if you cannot make it during the day time at the hospital. ",

There, they have taken an ECG and that doctor suggested me to go other hospital for further treatment. I chose to go to Manipal hospital, Jayanagar as it was close by. Though it was a complete lockdown, the initial formalities took some time and I was taken inside. After checking my ECG report, I was diagnosed with major heart attack. Immediately, Cardiology team jumped into action and within no time block was treated with Angioplasty.** ****** ** * ******* *** ** *** *******  I believe those words after my life was saved by Dr.Srihari Das and his team. He did a constant followup till the time I get discharged. During my next review, he recognised my name instantly (inspite of treating multiple patients) and started discussing with me about my health. I would like to thank the entire cardio team and other members who took care of me during the hospital stay. I would personally recommend Dr.Srihari Das.",

He is so friendly and explains about our condition in a very simple way.He spends lot of time with his patients and listens to them patiently.I had a sever Virtigo problem and consulted him. He  patiently listened to the symptoms and  diagonised it as Virtigo . It was so sever that I was scared that it would be any other  serious problem as I was not aware that it was Virtigo. He gave me confidence and cheered me up. Dr.Srihari doesn't suggest tests unless it is actually required and doesn\u2019t prescribe excess medicines.\nHe gets connected with his patients and my experience with him is, any doubt, I drop him a Whatsapp message and he promptly responds to it in-spite of his busy schedule. Usually after the treatment, it is the patient who follows-up with the Doctor. But with Dr.Srihari, he takes too much care in his patients that he regularly follows up on how they are doing. I had taken my mother to him for her high BP. Every now and then, he keeps checking with me on her health. He is such a caring person. Half of the ailment gets cured by the amount of care he shows.\nThank you so much Dr. I am so lucky that I know you.\n",

What does a person expects if he's consulting a doctor- First the doctor to listen calmly, Second to initiate diagnosis immediately, Third to suggest treatment options explaining risks and benefits, Fourth to understand patient's pain and financial limitations and be cooperative and finally keeping patient informed of the health condition and progress. I found this all while my father was undergoing treatment under him. Apart from this:\n1. He's Expert in his field. He identified heart problem from looking into my father's ECG, while other doctors said its normal. My father was discharged in 24hrs.\n2. He's Experienced. He performed Angioplasty for three blockages in an hour without compromising with the treatment. Also, I was kept informed of the progress at regular intervals, so OT was not a black box for me.\n3. He's very Calm. He had as many conversations as and when I had to answer my queries.\n4. Friendly and understanding. He's very cooperative and helpful. In fact he reprioritized his schedule to accommodate my father's treatment understanding the severity.\n\nI'll recommend Dr. Sridhar Das if you're looking for a cardiologist.",

That's mainly due to the way he listens to my dad's queries, the way he explains his diagnosis and the possible life-style adaptations to address the problem before straight away suggesting any procedures, medications or other treatments, brings in a lot of calmness.\n\nIts been a wonderful journey so far to me and my dad.\nPersonally I would say, I found a big brother in him than just a good cardiologist.",

Dr Shrihari was due to join this hospital the day after I came. However since I am just 35 years old the hospital called him and asked him to join a day prior and he gladly obliged. \nRight from the very first minute that he saw me there was this professional and calm demeanour about him. He's super efficient and prompt. Within 20 mins of him seeing me I was ready for an angiography and 20 mins post that he was done with the stenting. \nWhat truly separates a good doctor from a great one is handling the patient post the operation and making sure you answer their questions and make them feel at ease. This is where I think Dr Shrihari truly excels by giving you ample time post surgery and making you feel truly taken care of. \nCan't thank you enough doctor. \nSee you in Mumbai soon :)",

My father went through engiogram and had 3 major blockages to which doctor immediately helped us and got us operated from Dr Ramesh Sheshadri & Dr Devi Prasad Shetty. My father is doing just fine now and in good health.\r\n\r\nSpeaking about our experience, Dr Srihari Das is just amazing doctor. What makes him special is he is very down to earth doctor, very polite while talking to patients, hear them out nicely. He also stays in touch with patients and not just forget about them once done.

Luckily Doctor Sri hari was available.  The reception staff immediately referred my case to him.  He immediately called me and attended me and prescribed the requisite tests.  He told me that he will be waiting to see the results of the tests and see me again.  Though it took almost 1 and half hours to get the results he waited and saw me with the results.  I was meeting Dr Sri Hari for the first time.  My experience with him as a patient was really good and pleasant.  I am happy that I met him.   I look forward to have a long relationship with him.  Such well mannered Doctors certainly enhance the reputation of the Hospital.\r\n\r\nThanks once again.\r\n\r\nMajor Cherunny Chemmanoor",
