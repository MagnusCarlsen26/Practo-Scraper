After 2 years of medication as per his prescription i got sigh of relief to hear from him today that normalcy is regained. Initiatially, he gave appointments monthly, and then bimonthly & half yearly. He use to personally supervise ECG, some times B P checking as well.\nReally he is ray of hope for senior citizens like me.",
