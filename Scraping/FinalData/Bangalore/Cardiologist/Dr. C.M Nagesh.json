My dad had 100% blockage and one reputed hospital doctors told that there is no other way for treatment excep bypass surgery but we worried a lot, met many doctors but finally by god's grace we met Dr. C M Nagesh in Jaydeva where he gave confidence and told us this block can be cleared in angioplasty only,no need to go for Bypass surgery. Then after two days, he did angioplasty for my dad and he is alright now. I would like to conclude that Nagesh Sir is a specialist in Angioplasty. Thanks a lot Nagesh Sir.",

My dad had 100% blockage and one reputed hospital doctors told that there is no other way for treatment excep bypass surgery but we worried a lot, met many doctors but finally by god's grace we met Dr. C M Nagesh in Jaydeva where he gave confidence and told us this block can be cleared in angioplasty only,no need to go for Bypass surgery. Then after two days, he did angioplasty for my dad and he is alright now. I would like to conclude that Nagesh Sir is a specialist in Angioplasty. Thanks a lot Nagesh Sir.",
