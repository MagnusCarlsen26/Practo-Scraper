The third visit has been horrible. I have visited pulmonology dept. twice before which is great in organizing walkin/appointment of busiest docs but the exp with third vist to Manipal regarding consultation to cardiology dept (Dr Ranjan Shetty) is so bad that we had to wait for 3 hrs literally. They didn't take an appointment and called me to walk in on Sat which I did within 10 min. Walk-in is 1st come 1st serve basis. But here the wait of 3 hrs made me regret the decision of consulting Cardiology here. First the long wait and then No queue order whatsoever. So, ensure before visiting that you have fixed appointment and also ensure you have all day.On top of it, the attender was arrogant",

We waited for around 1 hour and 45 minutes for the doctor's consultation. (Which I didn't mind as a Cardiologist can have urgent engagements during the OP time). Upon entering the consultation room, doctor just asked if I had chest pain while walking, and when I said yes, he referred us to a TMT test. We came back to the doctor with the result, he just asked me to exercise regularly and consult him after a month. I felt this is fine for people of age 30-40 but I went there as my triglycerides where close to 700 and since I was taking medicines for other health conditions relating to heart health. Since I sensed doctor was in a hurry to get through the patients, I quickly informed him about the conditions and the lipid profile and triglycerides values which finally got his attention. Doctor, advised us for a CT Coronary Angiogram in a couple of days.

The third visit has been horrible. I have visited pulmonology dept. twice before which is great in organizing walkin/appointment of busiest docs but the exp with third vist to Manipal regarding consultation to cardiology dept (Dr Ranjan Shetty) is so bad that we had to wait for 3 hrs literally. They didn't take an appointment and called me to walk in on Sat which I did within 10 min. Walk-in is 1st come 1st serve basis. But here the wait of 3 hrs made me regret the decision of consulting Cardiology here. First the long wait and then No queue order whatsoever. So, ensure before visiting that you have fixed appointment and also ensure you have all day.On top of it, the attender was arrogant",

We waited for around 1 hour and 45 minutes for the doctor's consultation. (Which I didn't mind as a Cardiologist can have urgent engagements during the OP time). Upon entering the consultation room, doctor just asked if I had chest pain while walking, and when I said yes, he referred us to a TMT test. We came back to the doctor with the result, he just asked me to exercise regularly and consult him after a month. I felt this is fine for people of age 30-40 but I went there as my triglycerides where close to 700 and since I was taking medicines for other health conditions relating to heart health. Since I sensed doctor was in a hurry to get through the patients, I quickly informed him about the conditions and the lipid profile and triglycerides values which finally got his attention. Doctor, advised us for a CT Coronary Angiogram in a couple of days. Overall, it's my personal feeling, I feel I was not given time to explain my ailment *** **** ****** *** * ********* **** ** **** ******** ***** ** ***** *** ******* **** ** ******** **** *** ********** *** ************* *** *********\n\nI have decided to trust in his abilities and methods of diagnosis/treatment and see how it goes.

So it took me a total of 3 hours to get my consultation done. I probably don't recommend him for his less involvement and also for the treatment plan. Because, when I started visiting another doctor at a different hospital, I was informed about the critical condition of my health where I was not at all informed anything earlier at Manipal.",
