"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Cardioversion,",0,0,YES,"I booked a session at 12.40 P.M with the doctor, for fast and irregular heart rhythm, which he had to postpone to 5.10 P.M due to some emergency surgery he had to take care of. But, he personally called me and explained why he had to do that and asked me if I was okay with the new timing. Once I visited I had to wait for just 10-15 mins. Once he examined me he suggested ECG and Echo after checking which he told my heart was perfectly alright and the change in the pace of heart was probably just stress. He gave some tablet to bring down the heart rate. Now I'm feeling good. I would recommend this doctor.

"Wait time,","Heart Conditions,",0,0,NO,Went to the Clinic but did not consult the doctor. The doctor went out for rounds in some other hospital though we had appointment. That can be accepted as doctors do need to go for rounds. However the main reason why we left the place was the attitude of the receptionist. The receptionist was rude with not only us but even other patients and was making signs and remarks which is not acceptable. No one is visiting the clinic free of cost. Get a well behaved receptionist first,2021-02-03 04:35:34,False,False,Kaustav Bhattacharya,,,
