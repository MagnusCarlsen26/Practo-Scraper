I met many doctors in case of my mother but all doctors gave me clear reply to have a spine surgery done . I was very confused where to get the surgery done. \nAfter some time my one friend suggested me that you should meet to Dr. Revat (Apollo spectra hospital)\nSo I met to this doctor. He said that he could perform the spine surgery.\nI got the surgery date within one week and after the surgery was done my mother recovered within one month of time and she started walking again.\nWe were very happy with the kind of treatment she received from the doctor as well as all the staffs from the hospital. All the staff members were so kind and we did not feel like we were in a hospital. Hospital atmosphere feels like home .\nAfter 2 months my mother started her day to day routine. \n*** ***** ****** ** *** **** ******* He never suggest anything extra and didnt wasted any of our money.\nThe  package we received from the hospital was very Price efficient and reasonable.\nI would definitely recommend this hospital for spine surgery and specially Dr Revat who made this surgery look like a very normal surgery.",

Which is the least I can do for Dr. Rewat. He was always warm, open and clear with his diagnosis and plan for the surgery. His explanation and methods always had the big picture of long term recovery in clear view, and his language just the right mixture of professional opinion and friendly advice. He's happy to give you as much time or thought as you need while being open with communication channels from the start. Great experience, highly recommend.",

Few weeks after surgery my doctor told me that I might require another surgery. My family advised me to take second opinion and a family friend suggested Dr. Rewat's name. I travelled to Banagalore and when I showed my reports to him, I was scared to undergo another surgery. He patiently listened all the issues and asked me to get CT scan done. After looking at scan reports, he told me to start getting physiotherapy. He said we might not need to do another surgery. I followed his instructions. Few months later, my elbow has healed. Unlike other doctors, Dr. Rewat didn't take decision in haste and he explained how recovery may take time sometime. His patience and way of dealing with my injury made me confident that I was in safe hands. Thank you, Doctor.",

More over, his approach towards a patient like me was very commendable.  I underwent surgery upon his advice and within 2 days i was discharged. To my surprise, i was able to walk and do all my personal work without support within 2 months. I am thankful to him and I suggest him for any Orthodox related issues to anybody.",

I met many doctors in case of my mother but all doctors gave me clear reply to have a spine surgery done . I was very confused where to get the surgery done. \nAfter some time my one friend suggested me that you should meet to Dr. Revat (Apollo spectra hospital)\nSo I met to this doctor. He said that he could perform the spine surgery.\nI got the surgery date within one week and after the surgery was done my mother recovered within one month of time and she started walking again.\nWe were very happy with the kind of treatment she received from the doctor as well as all the staffs from the hospital. All the staff members were so kind and we did not feel like we were in a hospital. Hospital atmosphere feels like home .\nAfter 2 months my mother started her day to day routine. \n*** ***** ****** ** *** **** ******* He never suggest anything extra and didnt wasted any of our money.\nThe  package we received from the hospital was very Price efficient and reasonable.\nI would definitely recommend this hospital for spine surgery and specially Dr Revat who made this surgery look like a very normal surgery.",

Which is the least I can do for Dr. Rewat. He was always warm, open and clear with his diagnosis and plan for the surgery. His explanation and methods always had the big picture of long term recovery in clear view, and his language just the right mixture of professional opinion and friendly advice. He's happy to give you as much time or thought as you need while being open with communication channels from the start. Great experience, highly recommend.",

Few weeks after surgery my doctor told me that I might require another surgery. My family advised me to take second opinion and a family friend suggested Dr. Rewat's name. I travelled to Banagalore and when I showed my reports to him, I was scared to undergo another surgery. He patiently listened all the issues and asked me to get CT scan done. After looking at scan reports, he told me to start getting physiotherapy. He said we might not need to do another surgery. I followed his instructions. Few months later, my elbow has healed. Unlike other doctors, Dr. Rewat didn't take decision in haste and he explained how recovery may take time sometime. His patience and way of dealing with my injury made me confident that I was in safe hands. Thank you, Doctor.",

After consulting him, he explained me technically in detail . He was very patient in answering all my doubts. He was very friendly and suggested what is right and what is wrong.  More over, his approach towards a patient like me was very commendable.  I underwent surgery upon his advice and within 2 days i was discharged. To my surprise, i was able to walk and do all my personal work without support within 2 months. I am thankful to him and I suggest him for any Orthodox related issues to anybody.",
