"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Fracture Treatment,Joint Mobilization,",0,0,YES,Iâ€™ve been visiting Dr Prashanth for a broken finger. Heâ€™s an excellent orthopedist who doesnâ€™t prescribe unnecessary medication or surgery. His smile and the reassuring way in which he talks to you will melt away half your anxiety! Highly recommend him if you need an orthopaedic doctor. Just go to him and trust him - you are in safe hands ðŸ˜Š,2024-03-23 07:02:04,False,True,Aishwarya,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Total Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"My wife was suffering from knee pain from past 4 years, during this period I met many orthopaedic doctors in Bangalore, they gave her pain killers and other medication for cartilage.
I visited Dr. Prashant at Specialist Hospital in August 2022, he asked me to get my wife X-Ray done for both legs.  He saw the X-Rays and suggested for Bilateral Total Knee Replacement and explained me in detail.  I arranged for the funds and had the surgery done on 8/8/2022.  Know she is 
doing fine.
I recommend doctor Prashant and his team to anyone who wants to perform knee surgery, they are professionals in dong Robotic surgeries at an affordable price.
