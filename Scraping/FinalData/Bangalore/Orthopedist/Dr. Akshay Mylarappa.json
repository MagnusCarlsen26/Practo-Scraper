I got immediate relief of pain. Before visiting him I struggled to get inside the hospital but while coming out from hospital on treatment, happily put my steps without much stress. He has prescribed afew tablets and advised for simple exercises. I strongly recommend persons with orthopaedic problems to visit this doctor.. \nGod Bless You Akshay. You\u2019re doing good contribution to the society.  With regards, Manjunath Jois.",
