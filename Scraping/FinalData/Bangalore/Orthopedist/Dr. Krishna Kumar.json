                "review_text": "I am writing the review after my recent knee cartilage mosaicplasty surgery to share my problem, surgery, and rehabilitation experience. \n\nUnfortunately, I had a sudden knee pain in the month of September 2022. I consulted few doctors, but nothing was moving in a right direction. Medications, physiotherapy didn't heal my pain. \n \nHowever, with my friend\u2019s recommendation, I approached Dr Krishna Kumar in the month of Oct 2022. I still remember my first visit with doctor, I was literally limping, and he patiently listened the problem. I narrated the trauma and problem experienced in my left knee. I was under medication for 5 days which helped to subside the pain, but after the course completion, again the pain was generated. This time he proposed for a knee MRI to identify the exact root cause of the problem.\n\nMRI report was suggesting meniscus and minor cartilage tear, but Dr Krishna Kumar was sure that the cartilage tear is the primary reason for the knee pain. He just touched the affected knee area and could confirm the same.\n\nMy first phase 1 of diagnosis and treatment started with medicine. He suggested jointace DN tablet which basically helps to regenerate the cartilage tissue. I took it for ~ 60 days as prescribed. It helped me to manage the pain and was back to my feet, normal walk was possible. I was able to go to office, could do basic daily activities. But still the pain was persisted. Due to pain, I was unable to run, jog for a prolong 4-5 kms, cycling and climbing the staircase which were my essential and day to day exercise. \n\nI again consulted doctor and in this phase 2 somewhere around Jan 2023, he suggested osteofos 70, I was prescribed to take once a week with empty stomach in the early morning for 1 month. But unfortunately, this medicine also didn\u2019t solve the problem.\n\nProbably it was in the month of April 2023, doctor took a decision to go for a knee surgery as all the medication approaches didn't work. This I consider as phase 3. I was quite scared after hearing the surgery, but he nicely explained the mosaicplasty and arthroscopy technique which will be followed for grafting the damaged cartilage and fixing any probable issues related to meniscus if any. He nicely explained by drawing a picture and how this going to solve the problem permanently. Doctor also proposed to take some time and then go for surgery as there was no urgency required. Here I would like to emphasize that Dr Krishna Kumar is one of the few doctors who would like to solve the problem with a medication before applying the last resort which is surgery. \n\nI dragged my pain for almost 3-4 months due to some personal and professional commitments and however decided to undergo surgery in the month of Oct 2023.\n \nMy experience on the surgery day was very good. I was given spinal anesthesia which made my lower body numb. Dr Krishna exactly showed me the damaged cartilage in my left knee on the screen of the OT and clearly explained that there is no major issue in the meniscus, rather a cleaning and levelling in the meniscus will solve the 2nd problem. With his expertise, he meticulously completed the cartilage grafting in the damaged area which was the primary cause of the pain.\n\nI was hospitalized for a day and next day was discharged. Dr Krishna Kumar nicely explained the different phases of the rehab in a short meeting.\nIn the first phase for the 1st month post-surgery, I was asked by doctor not to apply any weight bearings on my left knee. But he suggested 5-6 exercises to improve range of motion.  \n\nIn the 2nd phase, Doctor asked me to be on 50 % weight bearings with the same set of range of motion exercises for the next 2 weeks.\n\nIn 3rd phase, he asked me to be on 100 % weight bearings and start normal walk on the plain surface. Additionally, this time, he asked me to ride static cycle and hit gym for strengthening the knee muscles. He exactly suggested machines which I should target for regaining the strength in the muscles. \n\nIn all these phases, he asked me to do the stretching, strengthen and range of motion exercises myself without involving any physiotherapist.\n\nIt has been 4 months from the surgery and can confidently say that the main problematic area is solved because as of today, I can walk, ride cycle easily for 4-5 kms in one stretch and climb the staircase periodically though within limits.\n\nAlthough there is a slight pain in the surrounding area of the knee while walking which is due to muscles weaking, Dr Krishna Kumar clearly told that more I walk and hit the gym, the muscles will regain its original strength and I shall be 100 % perfect. This is exactly what is happening with me, at the end of every week I see a gradual progress and improvements and pain is reducing gradually. I will write one more positive review when I am 100 % perfect and back to marathon. I am confident that in the next 2 months I will be able to reach my target.\n\nHaving said this, I would like to give 100 % credit to Dr Krishna Kumar for patiently helping me in all these phases of rehab, listening to my queries/questions and calmly answering, guiding, and educating me on how to improve gradually. Today I am back to my feet, can ride cycle because of Dr Krishna Kumar. You will be remembered throughout my life as a selfless and one of the most honest doctors. Thank you very much doctor.\n\nI strongly recommend consulting Dr Krishna Kumar for any issues related to Knee, be it cartilage, meniscus, ligament tear. You will get the most honest treatment and solution.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n",

                "review_text": "I am a decent good badminton and cricket player. These 2 game was the only thing that keeps me fit and alive.I have consulted Dr Krishna Kumar for my right shoulder dislocation. I had this problem 12 years back and I was worried about the surgery since many people used tell many things about after surgery complication. \n\nIn my first visit actually I didn\u2019t had any intention of doing surgery with him I just went for a third consultation. I planned my surgery in my native Mangalore. Since I didn\u2019t do this surgery for long years my native doctor felt me like a little care less guy and he made me little fear about the surgery and he told very strict rules after surgery for physiotherapy.\n\nThe moment I met Dr Krishna Kumar in my initial consultation, I felt like this is guy will do my surgery. He gave confidence like anything. He mainly said you will like earlier(Can play badminton and cricket) within 9 months with 200% confidence.\n\nIn Bangalore its very difficult to trust a Doctor. 3 way I trusted him blindly.\n\n1. The confidence he gave during my first consultation\n2. Stories from the practice page.\n3. This is so funny and I got 100% trust. I saw his WhatsApp DP, He has 2 daughters(My assumption). In our village there is a saying, God will give girl child only to good people. This made me to trust him 200%.\n\nMy surgery went well and after the surgery he was very supportive during my physiotherapy. He didn\u2019t suggested any physiotherapy consultation. He only showed my few physiotherapy  exercises. And I was consulting him timely manner and he was only guiding though my physiotherapy.\n\nBefore the surgery I was not doing any gym activity and I was just playing badminton and cricket since only game make my body and mind involved 100%. In gym activity only my body will be there not mind. During my physiotherapy  I learned lot about importance of strengthening exercise and now I am much more stronger as before the surgery. I was very particular about the physiotherapy the motive for this was to see myself in badminton court and cricket ground after 9 months.\n\nYou will be remembered through out my life and you are one example for Vaidyo Narayano Hari\n\nAnd I am writing this review after playing badminton in full power after 9 months of surgery. Thank you so much Doctor for making me go to badminton court and cricket ground.  This doctor is going to go a long way !!",

On consulting Dr. Krishna Kumar in HOSMAT  Hospital, Magrath Road she was advised to undergo knee joint surgery and replacement and no other medication or treatment would help as previously advised nearly by a dozen doctors who kept on advising separate blood tests, x ray, MRIetc., followed by administering pain killer medication , injection with Physiotheropy , exercise,  etc., and this continued for about 2 years. But, Dr. Krishna Kumar categorically said surgery and joint replacement is the only option and not to get misled anymore. I liked that true professional judgment because patients can decide at the earliest point and save their time and money in addition to avoiding prolonged pain. As far as Dr. Krishna Kumar\u2019s accessibility is concerned he responds immediately whether by way of phone calls or messages. With his pleasing and assuring approach patients are at ease. With regard to surgery done by him, I rest assure you guys, it is effective, efficient and highly professional. It\u2019s just over a month of post surgery, my wife is well recovering. I very strongly recommend to use the services of Dr. Krishna Kumar .\n",

In this situation, one of my friends referred me to Dr. Krishna Kumar. \n\nWith an anxious mind, I opened Dr. Krishna Kumar's door. He welcomed me with a smile, greeted me and asked me to take a seat. Being scared, instantly I took out my reports from the backpack and pushed it towards the doctor. With the same smile in his face, he asked me - \"what is the problem\"? \nHe was very calm and carefully listened to my description of symptoms. Then, he got off his chair, performed some clinical tests and sat back. After this, he opened the reports and reviewed them.  \nNow, understanding my situation, he explained to me that it is a minor problem and there is no need for the surgery. He prescribed me some tablets and exercises too. With his diagnosis and prescription, I was eventually relieved from the long-suffering pain.  \n\nThank you, Doctor. \n\nAdditionally, my parents have visited him for knee pain and they have shared similar feedback with me - he is always calm, composed and creates a friendly environment in the OPD.",

                "review_text": "I am writing the review after my recent knee cartilage mosaicplasty surgery to share my problem, surgery, and rehabilitation experience. \n\nUnfortunately, I had a sudden knee pain in the month of September 2022. I consulted few doctors, but nothing was moving in a right direction. Medications, physiotherapy didn't heal my pain. \n \nHowever, with my friend\u2019s recommendation, I approached Dr Krishna Kumar in the month of Oct 2022. I still remember my first visit with doctor, I was literally limping, and he patiently listened the problem. I narrated the trauma and problem experienced in my left knee. I was under medication for 5 days which helped to subside the pain, but after the course completion, again the pain was generated. This time he proposed for a knee MRI to identify the exact root cause of the problem.\n\nMRI report was suggesting meniscus and minor cartilage tear, but Dr Krishna Kumar was sure that the cartilage tear is the primary reason for the knee pain. He just touched the affected knee area and could confirm the same.\n\nMy first phase 1 of diagnosis and treatment started with medicine. He suggested jointace DN tablet which basically helps to regenerate the cartilage tissue. I took it for ~ 60 days as prescribed. It helped me to manage the pain and was back to my feet, normal walk was possible. I was able to go to office, could do basic daily activities. But still the pain was persisted. Due to pain, I was unable to run, jog for a prolong 4-5 kms, cycling and climbing the staircase which were my essential and day to day exercise. \n\nI again consulted doctor and in this phase 2 somewhere around Jan 2023, he suggested osteofos 70, I was prescribed to take once a week with empty stomach in the early morning for 1 month. But unfortunately, this medicine also didn\u2019t solve the problem.\n\nProbably it was in the month of April 2023, doctor took a decision to go for a knee surgery as all the medication approaches didn't work. This I consider as phase 3. I was quite scared after hearing the surgery, but he nicely explained the mosaicplasty and arthroscopy technique which will be followed for grafting the damaged cartilage and fixing any probable issues related to meniscus if any. He nicely explained by drawing a picture and how this going to solve the problem permanently. Doctor also proposed to take some time and then go for surgery as there was no urgency required. Here I would like to emphasize that Dr Krishna Kumar is one of the few doctors who would like to solve the problem with a medication before applying the last resort which is surgery. \n\nI dragged my pain for almost 3-4 months due to some personal and professional commitments and however decided to undergo surgery in the month of Oct 2023.\n \nMy experience on the surgery day was very good. I was given spinal anesthesia which made my lower body numb. Dr Krishna exactly showed me the damaged cartilage in my left knee on the screen of the OT and clearly explained that there is no major issue in the meniscus, rather a cleaning and levelling in the meniscus will solve the 2nd problem. With his expertise, he meticulously completed the cartilage grafting in the damaged area which was the primary cause of the pain.\n\nI was hospitalized for a day and next day was discharged. Dr Krishna Kumar nicely explained the different phases of the rehab in a short meeting.\nIn the first phase for the 1st month post-surgery, I was asked by doctor not to apply any weight bearings on my left knee. But he suggested 5-6 exercises to improve range of motion.  \n\nIn the 2nd phase, Doctor asked me to be on 50 % weight bearings with the same set of range of motion exercises for the next 2 weeks.\n\nIn 3rd phase, he asked me to be on 100 % weight bearings and start normal walk on the plain surface. Additionally, this time, he asked me to ride static cycle and hit gym for strengthening the knee muscles. He exactly suggested machines which I should target for regaining the strength in the muscles. \n\nIn all these phases, he asked me to do the stretching, strengthen and range of motion exercises myself without involving any physiotherapist.\n\nIt has been 4 months from the surgery and can confidently say that the main problematic area is solved because as of today, I can walk, ride cycle easily for 4-5 kms in one stretch and climb the staircase periodically though within limits.\n\nAlthough there is a slight pain in the surrounding area of the knee while walking which is due to muscles weaking, Dr Krishna Kumar clearly told that more I walk and hit the gym, the muscles will regain its original strength and I shall be 100 % perfect. This is exactly what is happening with me, at the end of every week I see a gradual progress and improvements and pain is reducing gradually. I will write one more positive review when I am 100 % perfect and back to marathon. I am confident that in the next 2 months I will be able to reach my target.\n\nHaving said this, I would like to give 100 % credit to Dr Krishna Kumar for patiently helping me in all these phases of rehab, listening to my queries/questions and calmly answering, guiding, and educating me on how to improve gradually. Today I am back to my feet, can ride cycle because of Dr Krishna Kumar. You will be remembered throughout my life as a selfless and one of the most honest doctors. Thank you very much doctor.\n\nI strongly recommend consulting Dr Krishna Kumar for any issues related to Knee, be it cartilage, meniscus, ligament tear. You will get the most honest treatment and solution.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n",

These 2 game was the only thing that keeps me fit and alive.I have consulted Dr Krishna Kumar for my right shoulder dislocation. I had this problem 12 years back and I was worried about the surgery since many people used tell many things about after surgery complication. \n\nIn my first visit actually I didn\u2019t had any intention of doing surgery with him I just went for a third consultation. I planned my surgery in my native Mangalore. Since I didn\u2019t do this surgery for long years my native doctor felt me like a little care less guy and he made me little fear about the surgery and he told very strict rules after surgery for physiotherapy.\n\nThe moment I met Dr Krishna Kumar in my initial consultation, I felt like this is guy will do my surgery. He gave confidence like anything. He mainly said you will like earlier(Can play badminton and cricket) within 9 months with 200% confidence.\n\nIn Bangalore its very difficult to trust a Doctor. 3 way I trusted him blindly.\n\n1. The confidence he gave during my first consultation\n2. Stories from the practice page.\n3. This is so funny and I got 100% trust. I saw his WhatsApp DP, He has 2 daughters(My assumption). In our village there is a saying, God will give girl child only to good people. This made me to trust him 200%.\n\nMy surgery went well and after the surgery he was very supportive during my physiotherapy. He didn\u2019t suggested any physiotherapy consultation. He only showed my few physiotherapy  exercises. And I was consulting him timely manner and he was only guiding though my physiotherapy.\n\nBefore the surgery I was not doing any gym activity and I was just playing badminton and cricket since only game make my body and mind involved 100%. In gym activity only my body will be there not mind. During my physiotherapy  I learned lot about importance of strengthening exercise and now I am much more stronger as before the surgery. I was very particular about the physiotherapy the motive for this was to see myself in badminton court and cricket ground after 9 months.\n\nYou will be remembered through out my life and you are one example for Vaidyo Narayano Hari\n\nAnd I am writing this review after playing badminton in full power after 9 months of surgery. Thank you so much Doctor for making me go to badminton court and cricket ground.  This doctor is going to go a long way !!",

On consulting Dr. Krishna Kumar in HOSMAT  Hospital, Magrath Road she was advised to undergo knee joint surgery and replacement and no other medication or treatment would help as previously advised nearly by a dozen doctors who kept on advising separate blood tests, x ray, MRIetc., followed by administering pain killer medication , injection with Physiotheropy , exercise,  etc., and this continued for about 2 years. But, Dr. Krishna Kumar categorically said surgery and joint replacement is the only option and not to get misled anymore. I liked that true professional judgment because patients can decide at the earliest point and save their time and money in addition to avoiding prolonged pain. As far as Dr. Krishna Kumar\u2019s accessibility is concerned he responds immediately whether by way of phone calls or messages. With his pleasing and assuring approach patients are at ease. With regard to surgery done by him, I rest assure you guys, it is effective, efficient and highly professional. It\u2019s just over a month of post surgery, my wife is well recovering. I very strongly recommend to use the services of Dr. Krishna Kumar .\n",

In this situation, one of my friends referred me to Dr. Krishna Kumar. \n\nWith an anxious mind, I opened Dr. Krishna Kumar's door. He welcomed me with a smile, greeted me and asked me to take a seat. Being scared, instantly I took out my reports from the backpack and pushed it towards the doctor. With the same smile in his face, he asked me - \"what is the problem\"? \nHe was very calm and carefully listened to my description of symptoms. Then, he got off his chair, performed some clinical tests and sat back. After this, he opened the reports and reviewed them.  \nNow, understanding my situation, he explained to me that it is a minor problem and there is no need for the surgery. He prescribed me some tablets and exercises too. With his diagnosis and prescription, I was eventually relieved from the long-suffering pain.  \n\nThank you, Doctor. \n\nAdditionally, my parents have visited him for knee pain and they have shared similar feedback with me - he is always calm, composed and creates a friendly environment in the OPD.",

Within 3 months of the surgery my father regained complete movement in both legs and is now leading a active lifestyle. There is no pain or any discomfort of any kind.\n\nSecondly, the credit of the fast recovery goes to Dr Krishna Kumar and the physiotherapists who were involved and helped us throughout during rehabilitation. Dr Krishna Kumar is calm, friendly and assuring. He listens to the problems, explains the issue in detail and answers any question you might have. He makes the patient feel comfortable and gives proper attention.  I highly recommend him.",
