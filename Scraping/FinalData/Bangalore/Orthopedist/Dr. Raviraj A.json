The treatment in Apollo Hospital was very good and Dr Raviraj is a very friendly person, so the patient will feel much relaxed and confident. He said the exact time for the recovery which a patient should follow strictly and then he has recommended physiotherapy. I have done the follow up in his clinic which is located in Vijaya Bank Layout. That clinic is very good and clean. People are very helpful in the clinic. I highly recommend him for any orthopaedic problems.",

I had seen for ligament tear in the left foot, knee pain in my right polio leg and lower back pain related issues. As the Clinic is not disabled friendly (too many steps to climb) i always see him in Apollo Hospital, Bannerghatta Road...I just like the way he receives with a smile, listens to the whole concern and his observation towards the problem. He listens patiently and as per the issue he suggests whether X-Ray is required or not....I like his process of diagnosing the problem and gives correct medication or treatment. So far by God's grace i always had 100% recovery whenever i approach him with any problem in my leg or back....He guides me so well and motivates too that i should not take too much tension. I always come out of his consultation room with a smile!!! Thank you sooo much Dr. RaviRaj for your kind service and proper treatment.....I never had any issues as such. I strongly recommend him for any Orthopedic related problems!!! Kudos!!! ",

Asked me not to worry but prescribed few medicines...Within few days only following his advice my pain got significantly better. He even responded to me quickly to help me finding a replacement medicine on chat. I am really glad to visit such a great doctor who listens to his patients and helps them to recover fast...I will visit again for further advice and definitely recommend others to consult him regarding any orthopedic issue..",

Recently we met him for Gait movement disorder and after  consultation he directed to another doctor in Apollo. We met the Doctor in Apollo and it was detected a Early Parkinsons syndrome and he needed a x-ray just to check/clarify. We came to Vijaya Bank Medical just to get the x-ray done. Once done, the x-ray centre directed to Doctor to get the report. The receptionist said to get the report from doctor and consultation would not be charged and sent us in.  Once inside Dr. Raviraj again started the whole process he did few days back where he asked to meet the doctors of Apollo. Once we came out the receptionist asked for the consultation as we had spent sometime with doctor. \n3. The doctor always seems to be in a hurry and i felt it would be better if explains the issues a bit more, if any exercise needs to be done or how to better manage the problem. It seems the patient needs to asks more question to get information of the Doctor.",

I guess the fact that there are so many patients waiting does not leave enough time for this currently.  But for a patient banking on the doctor's experience, this would make a huge difference.

As the Clinic is not disabled friendly (too many steps to climb) i always see him in Apollo Hospital, Bannerghatta Road...I just like the way he receives with a smile, listens to the whole concern and his observation towards the problem. He listens patiently and as per the issue he suggests whether X-Ray is required or not....I like his process of diagnosing the problem and gives correct medication or treatment. So far by God's grace i always had 100% recovery whenever i approach him with any problem in my leg or back....He guides me so well and motivates too that i should not take too much tension. I always come out of his consultation room with a smile!!! Thank you sooo much Dr. RaviRaj for your kind service and proper treatment.....I never had any issues as such.

When I visited his chamber, he carefully noted all my history of the back pain issue. Explained me the problem by looking at the MRI scans... Asked me not to worry but prescribed few medicines...Within few days only following his advice my pain got significantly better. He even responded to me quickly to help me finding a replacement medicine on chat. I am really glad to visit such a great doctor who listens to his patients and helps them to recover fast...I will visit again for further advice and definitely recommend others to consult him regarding any orthopedic issue..",

Dr Raviraj is good and his diagnosis is fine and i would have recommended the doctor but for the below reason unable to do so.\n2. Recently we met him for Gait movement disorder and after  consultation he directed to another doctor in Apollo. We met the Doctor in Apollo and it was detected a Early Parkinsons syndrome and he needed a x-ray just to check/clarify. We came to Vijaya Bank Medical just to get the x-ray done. Once done, the x-ray centre directed to Doctor to get the report. The receptionist said to get the report from doctor and consultation would not be charged and sent us in.  Once inside Dr. Raviraj again started the whole process he did few days back where he asked to meet the doctors of Apollo. Once we came out the receptionist asked for the consultation as we had spent sometime with doctor. \n3. The doctor always seems to be in a hurry and i felt it would be better if explains the issues a bit more, if any exercise needs to be done or how to better manage the problem. It seems the patient needs to asks more question to get information of the Doctor.",

Grateful that he rightly identified deficiencies and explored other options before suggesting MRI. Only wish the doctor had some time to pause and reflect on the patient's symptoms - I'm sure with his experience this will throw up possibilities that even multiple tests may not, especially when the case doesn't follow a straight forward route. I guess the fact that there are so many patients waiting does not leave enough time for this currently.  But for a patient banking on the doctor's experience, this would make a huge difference. Just my humble opinion,  respectfully.",

If you have visited for Physio therapy for rehabilitation u should have met a physiotherapist and not a orthopaedic surgeon. \nIt\u2019s not right on your part to comment that doctor I was talkative .. please clarify who was talkative yourself , receptionist or the doctor ?? \nI think that\u2019s your perception issue and this is not the right platform to comment on any one personally. Regarding the waiting I guess you are exaggerating it as total duration of the appointment system itself does not extend to the extent of time you have mentioned. The doctor always obliged and sees the patients in severe pain and children , elderly or those with fracture are emergency. You are taking an appointment with a specialist who caters to so many other patients also and wen u have an emergency to your own near and dear one would understand the delay in the appointments.\nThat requires a bit of patience and understanding the medical  treatment. There are quite a few walk-in patients coming whom we do not refuse treatment. \n\nThere are also practo patients who are reporting beyond the scheduled appointment and still claim that they have an appointment and fight with receptionist and we still try to accommodate them as walk in and not refuse to see them . Wetry to maintain the schedule as far as possible . This is our humble request to co operate with the consultation. \nIt\u2019s not a platform to discuss who is talkative who was fussy and who is dumb.\nPeople come in all shapes sizes and colours and behavioural habits and no one is to judge any one. \nRegarding the test which came as normal. Please understand that the test is done to identify a possible problem. And test is negative is not something to be unhappy about. You should be happy if a test comes negative. In that case if we could know which test would come as positive or surely show a problem, we could only order such tests. But then it won\u2019t be called as a test !!\n\nRegarding the comment about x ray cost I don\u2019t think this is a good platform to discuss this I think practo also should make a note of these feedback\u2019s were patient comments personally about the doctor / cost etc \nU need to understand the market cost of a digital x rays and we are at par with the present market rates. \n\nIf you are talking about the doctor being talkative , he needs to be talking to patients that\u2019s an integral part of consultation. There are people who think doctor did not speak to them at length and then there are some who say he talks too much. After all we are all humans and we too have talkative / less talking patients which we never complain about. This profession involves dealing with people and they come in variety. So are the doctors.",
