"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Total Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"I Visisted for the Total Knee replacement (bilateral surgery) for my mother

My Mother underwent Total Knee Replacement (TKR) of both knees in 06/March/2024 at Nano Hospitals. Dr.Mohan M R was the surgeon who did the procedure for my Mother.

Firstly, the TKR surgery itself is life changing. My mother is recovering well day by day by following the procedueres which doctor suggested.

Secondly, the credit of the speedy in recovering goes to Dr.Mohan M R sir and the physiotherapists who were involved and helped us during this process of recovering.

Dr.Mohan M R sir is friendly and assuring. He listens to the problems, explains the issue in detail and answers any question you might have.He makes the patient feel comfortable and gives proper attention.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr.Mohan M R sir for anyone considering bilateral Knee replacement surgery. His proficiency, dedication to patient well-being, and exemplary post-operative care make him an outstanding choice for individuals seeking a skilled and compassionate orthopedic surgeon. My gratitude to Dr.Mohan M R sir and his team for transforming what could have been a daunting experience into a remarkably positive and successful journey to improved mobility and quality of life.

The complete Nursing staff, house keeping, OT staff, finance staff and all others are really supportive in the hospital and responds on time..

Just by an x-ray observation and a 6 months old blood test report he prescribed steroids.

The most disturbing part is that after taking the steroids for a week the swelling which was only in knee ankle spread over the entire leg.
Again after revising him, he was generous to prescribe some related blood test. The test results showed Rheumatoid issues.
