I have also recommended my friend who is an ayurvedic Dr herself who was ailing from legament issue for years. She had difficulty walking & use to cry today after Dr. Varun operated on her she goes for jogging & is very happy. I personally would recommend Dr. Varun to all my friends very strongly. I wish him many more years of service.",

Only if I prescribe a MRI then I generally refer u to a particular centre where the radiologist is good so that I can discuss certain issues if they exists OR I leave it to my patient to decide where they want to go.\n\n2.The prices in any private Lab can never match CGHS.. since it's not govt aided ,my staff or myself would have never utter the word CGHS since we are not a part of it.\n\n3.We keep certain basic medicines only for the convenience of the patient .As per rules only medicines can be dispensed to a patient.There is never a compulsion that u need to take it from the clinic.. since there are so many ways u can buy medications online offline.. so on Iam surprised U have bought it and complained. \n\n4.If u are reluctant to get the investigations how can i diagnose ur disease ..and there is no follow up.. pain automatically will recur since what I would have started is only for symptomatic relief.\n\nI want to reemphasise that No patient coming to my clinic will be compelled to do anything against their decision. since it's the patients right to question get their doubts cleared and get their tests done wherever they want.\nIt is Patients rights.. and we doctors respect it.\n\n",

That's why doctors tend to over diagnose rather than underdiagnose due to such over/under educated patients like u who know how to put down the profession and pass bad remarks about a doctor who has made a hard way to reach this position.  We r not gods we treat he heals. \n\n\n\n",

Only if I prescribe a MRI then I generally refer u to a particular centre where the radiologist is good so that I can discuss certain issues if they exists OR I leave it to my patient to decide where they want to go.\n\n2.The prices in any private Lab can never match CGHS.. since it's not govt aided ,my staff or myself would have never utter the word CGHS since we are not a part of it.\n\n3.We keep certain basic medicines only for the convenience of the patient .As per rules only medicines can be dispensed to a patient.There is never a compulsion that u need to take it from the clinic.. since there are so many ways u can buy medications online offline.. so on Iam surprised U have bought it and complained. \n\n4.If u are reluctant to get the investigations how can i diagnose ur disease ..and there is no follow up.. pain automatically will recur since what I would have started is only for symptomatic relief.\n\nI want to reemphasise that No patient coming to my clinic will be compelled to do anything against their decision. since it's the patients right to question get their doubts cleared and get their tests done wherever they want.\nIt is Patients rights.. and we doctors respect it.\n\n",

That's why doctors tend to over diagnose rather than underdiagnose due to such over/under educated patients like u who know how to put down the profession and pass bad remarks about a doctor who has made a hard way to reach this position.  We r not gods we treat he heals. \n\n\n\n",
