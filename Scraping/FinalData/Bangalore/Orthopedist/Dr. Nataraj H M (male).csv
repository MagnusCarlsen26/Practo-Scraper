Really appreciate your feedback, this helps us to improve our services. I will explain what happened that day.  When you visited the hospital, during that time 12 patients registered in an internal of 45min ( ideally 3 patients can be seen in 45 min). Its not a mistake of hospital or doctor when more patients register at a time(some are late for the their appointments, some are early, some are emergencies). So the back log continued. That day I continued seeing patients without taking lunch break so that I can clear all the waiting patients. I was pretty much sitting in my cabin and seeing patients without stepping out. No appointments were cancelled but got delayed due to the rush.
