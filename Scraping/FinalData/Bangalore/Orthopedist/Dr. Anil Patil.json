This really helps the patient and their family  to ask more questions and understand better. This environment for open discussion eases a lot of inhibitions.\n\nDr. Anil as a Surgeon: I must say he is gifted with good hands that do wonders . My mother-in Law's bilateral TKR  is a testimony of this. she could not thanks Dr. Anil enough for making her quality of life better where she had lost all hopes. We are happy that we choose Dr Anil as our health care provider.\n\nSparsh Hospital: Dr Anil asked us to get admitted  at Sparh Hospital at Yashwanhpur and gave a contact of Sheethal for completing  the insurance pre-auth formalities. Sheethal got this authorization very quickly and advised us the date of admission. on the day of admission, I was very scared  as I saw a room full of customers discussing various issue at the billing department. I thought, I will have to go through this ordeal to have my bills settled even though I had complete per-authorization from my insurer.\nThis is where Sheethal come in and helps me right with the admission process to discharge. I am glad that I had Sheethal by my side who took utmost care of the queries,  issues/ concerns that we had. Her calm approach makes it very pleasant experience at the hospital and my initial impressions were totally ironed out.\nSheethal is truly a reflection of her name and her customer oriented approach is highly appreciable. \nMy whole family was very happy that we had such good experience at Sparsh Hospital Yashwanthpur. \n Thank you Sheethal for being so helpful.",

I found out about him through online search, so did not have the benefit of the confidence that comes with going to a doctor referred by someone. I however placed my trust in the reviews and went to him with an open mind.\n\nI am happy to say that my experience has been overwhelmingly positive with him. He devoted sufficient time for listening to me, doing the examination/assessment and  finally explaining everything to me in a way that I could understand. Based on this interaction I opted to undergo surgery as per his recommendation.\n\nOne thing I found especially remarkable was the accuracy of his assessment... Other doctors told me that I had ACL & MCL damage while he said that I had actually suffered MPFL damage after examining me in the same manner. This was later confirmed by the MRI scan. He also explained in detail the different levels of surgical intervention open to me (due to some issue with my bone structure), the risks associated with each option and left the decision making to me without forcing anything upon me.  \n\nThe surgery went off exactly like he said. He has been extremely approachable and supportive post surgery, constantly follows up on my progress and takes time to clarify even the smallest doubts that I have. It has been 8 weeks since my surgery and my rehabilitation has been progressing smoothly and as I had hoped.\n\nOne minor issue I faced was that the access to his clinic is challenging for people with leg problems... However he has taken my feedback in this regard positively and promised to find a solution soon.",

Found Dr.Anil Patil and his reviews were too good on Google and Practo, I was little speculative about him at the very beginning. But how he handled my situation made me completely trust him. After initial physical test he doubted about ACL tear which was later confirmed by MRI. Dr. suggested for ACL reconstruction and later I spoke to few more orthopedicians but I didn't feel confident and comfortable with anybody else. After 2 weeks of my injury I got my ACL reconstruction done. I'm currently under rehab and in hope to recover completely . Even now he communicates well and clears my doubt time to time. ",

This environment for open discussion eases a lot of inhibitions.\n\nDr. Anil as a Surgeon: I must say he is gifted with good hands that do wonders . My mother-in Law's bilateral TKR  is a testimony of this. she could not thanks Dr. Anil enough for making her quality of life better where she had lost all hopes. We are happy that we choose Dr Anil as our health care provider.\n\nSparsh Hospital: Dr Anil asked us to get admitted  at Sparh Hospital at Yashwanhpur and gave a contact of Sheethal for completing  the insurance pre-auth formalities. Sheethal got this authorization very quickly and advised us the date of admission. on the day of admission, I was very scared  as I saw a room full of customers discussing various issue at the billing department. I thought, I will have to go through this ordeal to have my bills settled even though I had complete per-authorization from my insurer.\nThis is where Sheethal come in and helps me right with the admission process to discharge. I am glad that I had Sheethal by my side who took utmost care of the queries,  issues/ concerns that we had. Her calm approach makes it very pleasant experience at the hospital and my initial impressions were totally ironed out.\nSheethal is truly a reflection of her name and her customer oriented approach is highly appreciable. \nMy whole family was very happy that we had such good experience at Sparsh Hospital Yashwanthpur. \n Thank you Sheethal for being so helpful.",

I found out about him through online search, so did not have the benefit of the confidence that comes with going to a doctor referred by someone. I however placed my trust in the reviews and went to him with an open mind.\n\nI am happy to say that my experience has been overwhelmingly positive with him. He devoted sufficient time for listening to me, doing the examination/assessment and  finally explaining everything to me in a way that I could understand. Based on this interaction I opted to undergo surgery as per his recommendation.\n\nOne thing I found especially remarkable was the accuracy of his assessment... Other doctors told me that I had ACL & MCL damage while he said that I had actually suffered MPFL damage after examining me in the same manner. This was later confirmed by the MRI scan. He also explained in detail the different levels of surgical intervention open to me (due to some issue with my bone structure), the risks associated with each option and left the decision making to me without forcing anything upon me.  \n\nThe surgery went off exactly like he said. He has been extremely approachable and supportive post surgery, constantly follows up on my progress and takes time to clarify even the smallest doubts that I have. It has been 8 weeks since my surgery and my rehabilitation has been progressing smoothly and as I had hoped.\n\nOne minor issue I faced was that the access to his clinic is challenging for people with leg problems... However he has taken my feedback in this regard positively and promised to find a solution soon.",

I had consulted him after i twisted my ankle totally 6 times in few years and as it happened many times he told to take MRI, as in the result ATFL had a complete tear, so he suggested for surgery, not only has he taken great care of my (Anterior Talofibular Ligament reconstruction surgery procedures, but also he is very friendly to speak to at every appointment about any issues you have. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend him for his dedicated care towards his patients.",

Got my ACL reconstruction surgery with Dr.Anil PatilDetailed review: After I got my knee injury I went on internet in search of orthopedician. Found Dr.Anil Patil and his reviews were too good on Google and Practo, I was little speculative about him at the very beginning. But how he handled my situation made me completely trust him. After initial physical test he doubted about ACL tear which was later confirmed by MRI. Dr. suggested for ACL reconstruction and later I spoke to few more orthopedicians but I didn't feel confident and comfortable with anybody else. After 2 weeks of my injury I got my ACL reconstruction done. I'm currently under rehab and in hope to recover completely . Even now he communicates well and clears my doubt time to time. ",

After few days by following the instructions gave by doctor has completely cured my knee pain..\nAm also getting treated for my mother for the same which even she is also feeling comfortable and relaxed with her knee and anckle pain for the medication and exercise.. Genuine for patience not like others who generally prefers to go for x-Ray or MRI\u2019s or other expensive scans or treatments for even a small injuries, usually Dr Anil prefers no unnecessary formalities as such.. Thank you Dr.Anil for the treatment.",

In today fast paced life I found Dr Anil to be able to give so much time for each patient as I had observed in the waiting room . He was unlike other doctors whom I have met before who give offer a diagnosis or medicines without even touching me . I found him to do a lot of tests which i obviously didn't understand .  My wife too had a pleasant experience during the course of her treatment for her ankle sprain .\n\nI strongly recommend visiting his clinic for orthopaedic sports injuries .  \n\n",
