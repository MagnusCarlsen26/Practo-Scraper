To focused treatments, good explanation of problem and why he is giving the particular treatments.Many doctors give too many medicines to my father in law for a simple fracture not getting settled. But He just cured with 150 rs stretch.the way he explained it seemed very trivial problem and simple solution required.",

We had no prior information about non-availability of doctor either telephonically or message. Being such a reputed clinic, this is very unprofessional and carelessness. I am deeply hurt by such response.\r\nHope you will take this matter seriously and find out the reason for such negligence.   \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSangita Bhowmik\r\nPatient name-Mr Ratan Sarkar",
