First, he listened to the problem properly and he suggested it very well. First time he prescribed medicine after some days he said taking more painkiller tablets are not good so if you have more pain than you can continue and his suggestion was helpful. There was not much waiting time for the doctor and I would like to recommend this doctor to others. During my discharge the staff were not cooperating well because they did not help with the billing process, it took a long time and it was needed for my office process and I am on bed due to hand fracture.
