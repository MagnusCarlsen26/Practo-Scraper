They explained in detail causes and possible issues. X ray dept was good and gave me X ray report within 20-30 mins.\n\nBad Part:\n1. They charge Rs 50 for registration details. This is wrong because registration of patient is done so that hospital can have a centralized information/Database. Now it's totally wrong for them to charge patient for this as it's to improve hospital processes.\n2. Waiting: My appointment was at 12 noon and I met the doctor at 1:20 pm, that is waiting time of approx 90 mins on working day. \n3. Hospital needs to improve the customer handling big time as these delays are not acceptable. Need to have better processes and patiently needs to be exactly told where next department is and what is the next process, patient shouldn't be left to wonder about the next steps.    ",

I have encountered the same . As you are serving to huge no patients in your hospital. It is quiet difficult to  attend those patients by Attenders which is making the people think they are ignorant in hospital. It could be bring effective supervision of Attending Patients and directing them or please Increase the Patients Attending Staff in Hospital.",

This is wrong because registration of patient is done so that hospital can have a centralized information/Database. Now it's totally wrong for them to charge patient for this as it's to improve hospital processes.\n2. Waiting: My appointment was at 12 noon and I met the doctor at 1:20 pm, that is waiting time of approx 90 mins on working day. \n3. Hospital needs to improve the customer handling big time as these delays are not acceptable. Need to have better processes and patiently needs to be exactly told where next department is and what is the next process, patient shouldn't be left to wonder about the next steps.    ",

I have encountered the same . As you are serving to huge no patients in your hospital. It is quiet difficult to  attend those patients by Attenders which is making the people think they are ignorant in hospital. It could be bring effective supervision of Attending Patients and directing them or please Increase the Patients Attending Staff in Hospital.",

Only hope that time when I was told by other doctors that I will get leg shortening due to bone trimming is him. Now I am a proud mother of 2 kids.",
