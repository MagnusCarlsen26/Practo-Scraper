I visited this doctor at his clinic ""Bone & Joint Clinic"" which is 25 KM from my home for Right HIP joint pain and suspected benign bone lesion on Left femur.
Before visiting him we visited more Doctors but every time on pain killer my pain is relieved.
Mr. Singh also gave same pain killer which relieved while we take but again it started if I don't eat medicine.

On 1st day when I consulted him he was very polite and checked throughly and gave pain killers for Right hip pain.
For suspected benign bone lesion on Left femur, he told strictly to get ""Onco CT Scan"" **** ** ****** **** *** **** ** **** ** ****** **** **** ***** **** * and also he strictly told us to do this scan in ""Columbia Asia Hebbal"" where he works FULL TIME and also he assured that he will be present there during the entire CT Scan. 
He did X-Ray and also charged full for X-Ray but he only provided me the soft copy.

He never explained that what type of this scan is and what is all process and what precautions we need to take before going for this test , except only one thing i.e. ""Full Body Scan to detect root cause of bone lesion and if any other place it is present or not"".

Next day we reached to ""Columbia Asia Hebbal"" to do the CT Scan at 9am. There we had to pay Mr. Singh's visiting charge and new registration and we were okay with that.
I asked him about Onco CT Scan but he was rushing too much but he didn't explain it properly.
Also we told him we are getting only ""PET CT Scan"" by searching ""Onco CT Scan"", that time he said we will do PET Scan also after this. I mean how can you tell this in this easy way **** *** **** ******* ** **** **** *** ***** **** * *********** ***** ***** ** **** ** *** **** *** ** ***** *** ******** *** ******* ********** ********* *** *********

Also there we got to know what Mr. Singh didn't told us previous day.
     - > Before CT Scan I had to come empty stomach and luckily I went empty stomach .
     - > We have to do some blood test prior to it.
     - > Before CT Scan some kind of solution will be injected to my body. 
    - > Lastly he was not clear with the amount of this scan he said it will cost 4-5k but it actually it costed 8k.

Mr. Singh help me to get blood test report faster than expected and when I went for the CT Scan. I had to wait for more 1hr and the receptionist told me to ""PAY AFTER I AM DONE WITH CT SCAN"".
During this period I saw Mr. Singh was roaming here and there and then he took a newspaper and went to cafeteria and after sometime I saw him leaving the hospital. 

REMEMBER: He had assured previous day that he will be present there during the entire CT Scan.

After the CT scan is done I was to that it will take 3 hrs to generate the report so I ""PAID"" the amount and went to near by restaurant as me and my wife didn't had any thing since morning and that current time was 1.30pm.
After returning around 4 pm we got our report and then wanted to consult with Mr. Singh.
I know he sits at his personal chamber at around 4.30 pm which is around 4-5 km from the Columbia Asia Hebbal Hospital and our home is around 20KM far. So we decided to visit his chamber same day without any delay and we called to his reception and reception guy told us to come.

By now I was too much tired for the whole day under going so much.
**** * **** *** *** **** ** *** ******
I reached to his chamber for consulting the reports and he started talking to me and my wife in a very RUDE manner.
He blamed us falsely that ""We left Columbia Asia Hebbal Hospital without taking test and didn't paid test bill and also he said he was looking for me which was totally a false claim, we were sitting there and watched his activities there as mentioned above and even he didn't see the report he said rudely come other day next week""!
He insulted me like this in front of everybody, I was really shocked with this unacceptable behaviour.*** **** * *** ** ****** **** * ******* *** ** ********** ******** *** **** ** *** *** **** ** ******** ********
