,,0,0,Yes,"*** ******** ********* *** **** ***** He will give good guidance which will help to cure problems very soon. The doctor behavior was good. First, he listened to the problem properly and he suggested it very well. First time he prescribed medicine after some days he said taking more painkiller tablets are not good so if you have more pain than you can continue and his suggestion was helpful. There was not much waiting time for the doctor and I would like to recommend this doctor to others.
