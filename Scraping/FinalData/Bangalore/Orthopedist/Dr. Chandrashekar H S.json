He did not even examine my leg properly neither did he give me any information. I had to ask all he questions. On showing the MRI he read out what was already written in the report which I had already read. As a doctor he should have explained what it means. I was so disappointed that I went to another doctor and had such a detailed examination of my leg. He even taught me a few exercises and this doctor was actually worried about my leg and was not just trying to wash his hands off. I wish I had gone there first.",

I was so disappointed that I went to another doctor and had such a detailed examination of my leg.
