"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,Value for money,","Knee care,",0,0,YES,"Gathered that Doctor normally does not visit Trustwell Hospital on Saturdays. Since we had booked through Practo, Doctor made a visit. Kindly check and update so that it will be helpful for future appointments on Saturday. Doctor was very helpful, explained in simple terms. His reassuring words and simplicity were exemplary. Hats off
