Neither Doctor nor his staff took any effort in informing that Doctor's unavailability. The staff simply insisted to wait until the Doctor comes without giving any reason on why the delay and when will the Doctor be back. So many patients with me were left disappointed. This is not the kind of treatment I would expect. I felt there was no respect for patients' time. After waiting for a long time and getting tired of not receiving any response, I left the place. Have previously visited the Doctor. ",
