Initially, he was advised to undergo a knee replacement, but as a stop-gap solution, he suggested an arthroscopy instead.\n\nUnfortunately, this turned out to be a disastrous decision. My father\u2019s left knee was completely worn out, and the arthroscopy did nothing to address the problem. This surgery was performed on March 12th, by Dr. Pradyumna Raghu, followed by a review surgery a week later, which further deteriorated his condition. * *** *** **** ****** ** *** ********** ********* *** he has been in severe pain for over two months.\n\n** **** ******* ****** *** ****** ******* ******** ******** *** ********** ****** *** ** *** **** * ******* ** * **** ** ********* ***** ** *** ******* ******* *** ***** ** *** ****** Despite this severe deterioration, the doctor failed to adequately prepare or counsel my father about the potential pain and complications.\n\nWhen my father reached out to the doctor expressing his pain, he was met with ********* *** * lack of empathy. *** ********* ***** **** ********** ***** ** ****** ******* **** ****** *** **** ******* *** ******* **** ** *********** ******* ***** ****** ******* ***** ************* **** *** ******** ** ***** ********** *********** ** *** ******** ********** **** ** *** ******* ***** ** ****** *** ****** ********* *** *** *********\n\nThis whole ordeal has not only affected my father\u2019s physical health but also caused immense mental trauma.
