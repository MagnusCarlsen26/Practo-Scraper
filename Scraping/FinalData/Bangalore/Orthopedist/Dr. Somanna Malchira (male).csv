"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,",,0,0,YES,"Here I am writing the review after 6 months of my treatment at Aster CMI hospital, Hebbal, Bangalore.
It was a really great treatment by Dr. Sumanna. 
I had a surgery with metal implant for my leg bone fracture. Ofcourse it was scary and initially I was really concerned how fast and how well it will be healed. 
Thank you doctor. Your experience, excellence and confidence, played a big role in boosting up my confidence and became my strength everyday. 

I would like to mention as well the followup checkup in 6 months I had here in Germany. You know, it is always pleasant to have a positive feedback from another expert. Yes that's what happe happened. The doctor here was so happy with surgery, he repeatedly told just WOW and finally asked the doctor and hospital name and concluded with a statement ""wow India has great doctors!"". Feel proud of India and again thank you Dr. Sumanna. God bless you.",2022-08-07 11:59:23,False,True,Mr. Jyotipriya Das,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Osteoarthritis,Joint Pain,Knee Problems,Knee Replacement,",0,0,YES,"Dr.Somanna is very professional, courteous and polite. I consulted with him and picked him as the surgeon for my mother's knee replacement surgery at Aster CMI hospital. The diagnosis, explanation of core issues & scheduling of the surgery was all done promptly by him and staff. He also helped my mom understand more about the surgery, prepped her and took post operative care too. He was always reachable in case of queries and helped us through the 2-3 month journey. I'd recommend him for knee replacement in Bangalore.",2022-03-16 09:28:28,False,True,Divij Sharma,,,
