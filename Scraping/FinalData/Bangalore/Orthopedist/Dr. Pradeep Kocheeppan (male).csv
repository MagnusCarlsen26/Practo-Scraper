"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Knee care,ACL Surgery,",0,0,YES,"I recently underwent ACL reconstruction surgery performed by Dr. Pradeep Kocheeppan, and I'm very happy to recommend him to anyone facing a similar situation. Dr Kocheeppan is a highly skilled orthopedic surgeon who instilled confidence throughout the entire process.

His expertise was evident from the initial consultation. He clearly explained the procedure, answered all my questions patiently, and addressed any concerns I had. During the surgery itself, I felt completely at ease thanks to his professionalism and experience.

Dr Kocheeppan encouraged me to start physiotherapy before the surgery, and this pre-surgical physiotherapy proved to be invaluable. As a result, my rehabilitation process after the surgery was smooth and pain-free. I'm now recovering well and on track for a full return to activity. Dr. Kocheeppan's surgical skill, guidance, and commitment to comprehensive patient care played a vital role in this positive outcome.

Moreover, Dr Kocheeppan also performed a successful knee replacement surgery on my father-in-law, which further solidified my impression of him as a well-rounded and highly skilled orthopedic surgeon who excels in both ACL reconstruction and joint replacements.

If you're looking for a top-notch orthopedic surgeon for ACL reconstruction, knee replacement, or any other orthopedic need, I highly recommend Dr Pradeep Kocheeppan. His expertise, combined with his focus on comprehensive patient care, makes him an outstanding doctor.",2024-03-13 11:40:05,False,True,Roy John,,,
