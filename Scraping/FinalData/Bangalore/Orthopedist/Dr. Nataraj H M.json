When you visited the hospital, during that time 12 patients registered in an internal of 45min ( ideally 3 patients can be seen in 45 min). Its not a mistake of hospital or doctor when more patients register at a time(some are late for the their appointments, some are early, some are emergencies). So the back log continued. That day I continued seeing patients without taking lunch break so that I can clear all the waiting patients. I was pretty much sitting in my cabin and seeing patients without stepping out. No appointments were cancelled but got delayed due to the rush. \nThank you",

The physiotherapist (Ms. Megna) is also very knowledgeable and cordial. \n\nIt would not be an exaggeration if I say Dr.Nataraj is indeed an expert orthopedist and one of the very few in Bangalore to have  given us a lucid explanation about the pain which helped us to keep our cool and stay bother-free.

The doctor is well read and explained us the problem which my father is suffering from with pictures on his laptop and scientific explanations. He explained all the treatment options for the disease. Previously we visited 2 very big hospitals but no body explained to us so well, they just said admit him for knee replacement surgery. Knee pain reduced with the course of medicine and physiotherapy(Even the physiotherapist was awesome) which the doctor prescribed but still understood that Knee replacement surgery is the permanent cure. Definitely I will get my father's knee replaced by Dr Nataraj after few months.",

She was suffering from shoulder pain from almost a year due to rotator cuff tear. We met couple of doctors but we were not confident to undergo surgery by them. Then I remembered Dr Nataraj who had done a keyhole shoulder surgery for my colleague for shoulder dislocation and he recovered very well. So we thought of meeting him once for a opinion. We were fully convinced that we met a right person and underwent surgery. He was very helpful throughout and made all the process very smooth including arranging a physio to come to our home. Now my mother in law is pain free, able to cook and take care of our children. I fully recommend him for shoulder surgery.  ",

When you visited the hospital, during that time 12 patients registered in an internal of 45min ( ideally 3 patients can be seen in 45 min). Its not a mistake of hospital or doctor when more patients register at a time(some are late for the their appointments, some are early, some are emergencies). So the back log continued. That day I continued seeing patients without taking lunch break so that I can clear all the waiting patients. I was pretty much sitting in my cabin and seeing patients without stepping out. No appointments were cancelled but got delayed due to the rush. \nThank you",

The physiotherapist (Ms. Megna) is also very knowledgeable and cordial. \n\nIt would not be an exaggeration if I say Dr.Nataraj is indeed an expert orthopedist and one of the very few in Bangalore to have  given us a lucid explanation about the pain which helped us to keep our cool and stay bother-free.

The doctor is well read and explained us the problem which my father is suffering from with pictures on his laptop and scientific explanations. He explained all the treatment options for the disease. Previously we visited 2 very big hospitals but no body explained to us so well, they just said admit him for knee replacement surgery. Knee pain reduced with the course of medicine and physiotherapy(Even the physiotherapist was awesome) which the doctor prescribed but still understood that Knee replacement surgery is the permanent cure. Definitely I will get my father's knee replaced by Dr Nataraj after few months.",

She was suffering from shoulder pain from almost a year due to rotator cuff tear. We met couple of doctors but we were not confident to undergo surgery by them. Then I remembered Dr Nataraj who had done a keyhole shoulder surgery for my colleague for shoulder dislocation and he recovered very well. So we thought of meeting him once for a opinion. We were fully convinced that we met a right person and underwent surgery. He was very helpful throughout and made all the process very smooth including arranging a physio to come to our home. Now my mother in law is pain free, able to cook and take care of our children. I fully recommend him for shoulder surgery.  ",
