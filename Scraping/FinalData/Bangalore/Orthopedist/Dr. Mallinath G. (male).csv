"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Joint and Muscle Problems,Sports Injury,",0,0,NO,"I visited Dr. Mallinath on 31st Dec 2022 because my heel soft tissue was paining. I have a flat foot and I had an idea that the pain was because of playing sports.

The doc looked at my foot and said that the pain is because of flat foot (and that's it!!) - no treatment, no remedy, no way to reduce the pain.
