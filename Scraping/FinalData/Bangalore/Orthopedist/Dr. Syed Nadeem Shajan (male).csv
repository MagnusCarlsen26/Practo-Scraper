,,0,0,YES,"Wanted to give some feedback on my Wife's Dr. Syed Nadeem.

I met with a serious accident along with my Wife who was sitting behind me on a bike. 
Somewhat we reached to Medclick hospital emmediate after this accident and their faculty informed us that for your wife's Leg treatment (injury which is for main Leg Bone got broken into two pieces) then we met this Dr. Nadeem. Trust me I got so scared about my wife health that time I cannot express in word's cause it was really a serious accident. When I met Dr. Nadeem and the way Dr. Explained about the injury and the process of treatment made me relaxed and comfortable. 

I really want to Thank Dr. Syed Nadeem for being so generous and kind till my wife's Leg treatment is completely done. Now my wife is walking without any support... 
Thank you Dr. Once again. Much appreciated your treatment and support..‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç",2024-07-27 16:35:28,False,True,Abdul Waheed ,,,
