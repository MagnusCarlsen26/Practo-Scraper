As a fitness enthusiast, it was difficult for me to accept that I have to go through a surgery. I consulted almost 5 suggested surgeons, but when I met Dr. Pavan, he was the only one who explained my problem soooo clearly and my treatment. From the day 1, until my recover he was always available when needed \nSurgery was just a day being in the hospital, pain started after the 2nd day of surgery. Dr. Pavan was always available and suggesting the best things to do. Started Physio therapy as per his advice, today it been two months, now I\u2019ll felling confident with my arm than ever.\nPost surgery, his care, *** ********* of what\u2019s happening and what will happen was astounding. \nHe understands what we want, he helped me through out this phase for me to recover faster. \nTo conclude, his care *** *** ********* of the issue is enormous. Will recommend him to anyone with this issue without hesitation.\nIf you are reading this and going through such recovery phase, wish you all a speedy recovery!",

I researched on Practo and decided to consult Dr. Pavan Chebbi after looking at his experience in the field if sports injury. He explained everything very patiently at his Amber Clinic. He assured me that I will be able to go back to sports if I get the surgery done. He connected me ro relevant party to get my insurance on the way. Once insurance was approved, the surgery was performed at Apollo Spectra Hospital, Koramangala. The surgery was performed without any complications. Dr. Pavan talked to me during the surgery and showed me the damaged and replaced ACL. After the surgery, I was transferred to the ward where the hospital staff was very negligent. This was the only bad experience I had. Immediately after the surgery, the care provided by the hospital was minimal. The Physiotherapist that the hospital provided for initial exercises was also very arrogant. But at night, the nurse took really good care. It was a difficult night as it was the first night after surgery. Anyway, once I was discharged, I revisited Dr. Pavan for further procedures such as dressing and stitches removal. Even during lockdown, he kept touch with me on Whatsapp and via call. I started going to a Physiotherapist nearby and he told me about the exercises. Dr. Pavan also taught some exercises that I started performing. It is been over two and a half months now, as the surgery was performed on 12th March. I met Dr. Pavan day before yesterday and my recovery is excellent, both according to him and my Physiotherapist. I am confident that in 9 months I will be able to play again. I am really grateful to Dr. Pavan whi is an outstanding surgeon and an even better human being. He has quite literally helped me get back on my feet with confidence. I recommend him for any Orthopaedic advice without a doubt. ** ** ****** *** ** *** ***** ",

Because I met Dr. Pavan Chebbi for my Elbow fracture.\nI had lost my hope regarding my right hand as I am not able to bend or stretch it, it was stuck somewhere 95 to 100 degrees. At that time I was not able to do my normal works like having food, washing my face as my palm is not reaching.\nIn this time, he patiently listened to my problem and He gave me HOPE that I could use my right hand normally as before and asked me to go for surgery. The surgery went well and almost took more than 3 hours (31-03-2021). After that he suggested me to go for physiotherapy for 2 months. But before one month only I am feeling normal about my right hand. Now I can eat, wash my face, and do normal activities with the right hand, and continue my office work without any problem.\nI could say the Doctor is a very cool and calm person, and listens to the patient's problems with uttermost patience, and explains the problems and any causes bit by bit slowly so that any layman could understand easily. Down-to-earth person. I am totally satisfied with Dr. Pavan Chebbi's treatment. And also He helped me to get my insurance very easily, he provided all the documents whenever needed. I strongly recommend to others with orthopedic problems.",

I got to know about Dr. Pawan through some common friends who had undergone treatment from him and were very positive and appreciative about his way of treating a problem/disease. By Oct 2018 my pain had increased a lot and so I visited Dr. Pawan. A complete check up and few tests were done for me. What really impressed me was his very friendly way of explaining me clearly about my condition and what needs to be done both in the short and the long duration to avoid such problems. The medicines he prescribed were both easily available and not expensive either and it worked like wonder for me. I also underwent the Physiotherapy and other advice as suggested by Dr. Pawan and as of today my problem with my back is totally gone and I feel so relieved to be able to move around and do normal chores like before...Thanks to Dr. Pawan's advice and guidance which has shown me results in just a few days. I had spent a lot elsewhere without any effective results.",

From the day 1, until my recover he was always available when needed \nSurgery was just a day being in the hospital, pain started after the 2nd day of surgery. Dr. Pavan was always available and suggesting the best things to do. Started Physio therapy as per his advice, today it been two months, now I\u2019ll felling confident with my arm than ever.\nPost surgery, his care, *** ********* of what\u2019s happening and what will happen was astounding. \nHe understands what we want, he helped me through out this phase for me to recover faster. \nTo conclude, his care *** *** ********* of the issue is enormous.

I researched on Practo and decided to consult Dr. Pavan Chebbi after looking at his experience in the field if sports injury. He explained everything very patiently at his Amber Clinic. He assured me that I will be able to go back to sports if I get the surgery done. He connected me ro relevant party to get my insurance on the way. Once insurance was approved, the surgery was performed at Apollo Spectra Hospital, Koramangala. The surgery was performed without any complications. Dr. Pavan talked to me during the surgery and showed me the damaged and replaced ACL. After the surgery, I was transferred to the ward where the hospital staff was very negligent. This was the only bad experience I had. Immediately after the surgery, the care provided by the hospital was minimal. The Physiotherapist that the hospital provided for initial exercises was also very arrogant. But at night, the nurse took really good care. It was a difficult night as it was the first night after surgery. Anyway, once I was discharged, I revisited Dr. Pavan for further procedures such as dressing and stitches removal. Even during lockdown, he kept touch with me on Whatsapp and via call. I started going to a Physiotherapist nearby and he told me about the exercises. Dr. Pavan also taught some exercises that I started performing. It is been over two and a half months now, as the surgery was performed on 12th March. I met Dr. Pavan day before yesterday and my recovery is excellent, both according to him and my Physiotherapist. I am confident that in 9 months I will be able to play again. I am really grateful to Dr. Pavan whi is an outstanding surgeon and an even better human being. He has quite literally helped me get back on my feet with confidence. I recommend him for any Orthopaedic advice without a doubt. ** ** ****** *** ** *** ***** ",

Because I met Dr. Pavan Chebbi for my Elbow fracture.\nI had lost my hope regarding my right hand as I am not able to bend or stretch it, it was stuck somewhere 95 to 100 degrees. At that time I was not able to do my normal works like having food, washing my face as my palm is not reaching.\nIn this time, he patiently listened to my problem and He gave me HOPE that I could use my right hand normally as before and asked me to go for surgery. The surgery went well and almost took more than 3 hours (31-03-2021). After that he suggested me to go for physiotherapy for 2 months. But before one month only I am feeling normal about my right hand. Now I can eat, wash my face, and do normal activities with the right hand, and continue my office work without any problem.\nI could say the Doctor is a very cool and calm person, and listens to the patient's problems with uttermost patience, and explains the problems and any causes bit by bit slowly so that any layman could understand easily. Down-to-earth person. I am totally satisfied with Dr. Pavan Chebbi's treatment. And also He helped me to get my insurance very easily, he provided all the documents whenever needed. I strongly recommend to others with orthopedic problems.",

I got to know about Dr. Pawan through some common friends who had undergone treatment from him and were very positive and appreciative about his way of treating a problem/disease. By Oct 2018 my pain had increased a lot and so I visited Dr. Pawan. A complete check up and few tests were done for me. What really impressed me was his very friendly way of explaining me clearly about my condition and what needs to be done both in the short and the long duration to avoid such problems. The medicines he prescribed were both easily available and not expensive either and it worked like wonder for me. I also underwent the Physiotherapy and other advice as suggested by Dr. Pawan and as of today my problem with my back is totally gone and I feel so relieved to be able to move around and do normal chores like before...Thanks to Dr. Pawan's advice and guidance which has shown me results in just a few days. I had spent a lot elsewhere without any effective results.",

He gave a detailed explanation of the type of arthroscopy, the materials used for the surgery, the rehabilitation period & time to get back to sports and riding which is my passion. I had almost a smooth recovery post surgery. The physio exercises also helped a great deal. \nAfter more than a year of the surgery I am back to what I love. Thanks to doc for his timely help and support. I would like to recommend Dr. Pavan Chebbi for anyone with ACL injury.",

I kept trying physiotherapy and massages it made it worse.. \nI was in excruciating pain and no amount of medicines and injections helped me.\nI then consulted Dr. Pavan Chebbi who did a thorough check up, got CT and MRI scans and found out that my tendons were stuck in between the shoulder joint. I had to undergo arthroscopic surgery to release and reattach the tendons. \nAs promised by the doctor I started moving my shoulder within 2 weeks! I am extremely happy with the surgery. \nNo amount thanks is enough for Dr Pavan Chebbi and his team. He is absolutely calm and his reassuring words helped me through the whole process.",

After MRI got to know that there's tear in my muscle and needs an Arthroscopy to repair it. Though initially I was so scared, Pavan explained me the problem clearly and also the surgical procedure. After surgery follow up was really good, doctor gave me right exercises and medication to recover soon and was always available over the phone call for all emergency purposes. Now I'm recovered to better extent and could see major improvement in my shoulder muscle. Thank you doctor for your amazing treatment and kind support.",

Then, he asked for an X-ray to get done in order to rule out fracture. We got back to the clinic after 30 mins and it was 10:00 PM. But, Dr Pavan patiently looked at the X-ray and suggested that this is a ligament issue which would take some time and should heal on its own. He had given medicines and gel to apply and suggested few methods in order to not complicate the issue/trigger it any further. I would recommend Dr Pavan for his ******** diagnosis and vast experience. ",

But unfortunately had a minor fall late 2021. \nSince then it became difficult for her to walk even a few steps. We went for a check up with Dr Chebbi and in his opinion she had a ligament meniscus tear for which treatment was given. He also told that this situation can flare up her already existing osteo-arthritis. Also he told us about a possibility of a knee replacement in the near future. My mother managed the pain for few more months and when she had enough then we again consulted Dr Chebbi. As usual we had a lot of questions and doubts but all of them were answered by the doctor. In early March 2022 we had the total knee replacement surgery done and now in mid April she is doing better then we had expected. She\u2019s walking independently, doing her chores, exercises with out much effort. We are great full that we happen to get a good doctor like Dr Chebbi. He has made this whole process so simple and did not hesitate to answer all our questions at anytime. Overall it was smooth process and thanks to doctor and his team.",

As my brother had head injury so his surgery  was delayed  for almost 6 month and after 6th month he had undergone surgery which didn't go well  so  I decided to bring him Bangalore  for his treatment. So I met Dr Pavan Chebbi  showed him all the reports and X-ray ,he listened to the problem genuinely, gone through all the reports patiently  and  explained  treatment plan needs to be done  and what all risk associated with the fracture as fracture where in sensitive places keeping  in mind medical expenses. He guided me with physiotherapy as well that  needs to be done before  and after surgeries.  As per his guidance and plan, one after other surgery went well and now he is able to walk after  Knee contracture release, able to do his work after right wrist surgery and left humerus fracture (which currently in healing phase). \nI would like to thank him a lot because of his patience  and the  treatment given to my brother.\nI am continuously following up with him for the treatment from past 7 -8 months till now.\n\nI would like to recommend him for ortho treatment  and would like to give 5 star rating  from my side.\n\nThank You.",

Doctor very patiently handled my daughter who still has immense pain in her fingers. At the same time doctor removed the stitches very seamlessly.I am extremely happy after seeing Dr. Pavan. I would certainly recommend others to seek advice at this clinic.",

I met a lot of doctors who recommended knee replacement surgery but since it is a dead-end last resort option I was hesitant to take it as I am very active and independent. Dr Pavan Chebbi recommended me an osteotomy surgery which does not require any replacement, relieve the pain and also let me be as active as possible. \nDoctor explain to me in very simple terms The exact nature of the procedure The advantages and disadvantages at my age 57. \nDuring my recent follow-up after eight months of the surgery I am able to do all my routine chores and the doctor has told me to start cycling and light exercises.\nI am very satisfied with the treatment provided by Dr Pavan Chebbi I would like to wish him great success in his noble endeavours.",

At my age I am 43 many family doctors friends were against joint replacement. Then I have read about Bone marrow stem cells treatment for AVN. I approached Dr Pavan for the same and he had explained about the whole process with good to excellent results guarantee. So I had went ahead with the surgery. It is showing very good results now and my latest MRI also is showing that the treatment is working. I and my family are very much thankful for the treatment by Dr Pavan and Will like to recommend people who have unfortunately this AVN condition. To seek the right type of treatment.",

However, at any point of the treatment I was not scared because everything was as I was told earlier. This helped me to prepare myself in advance and then proceed further. \nBut yes, the few days after the surgery I was in pain no doubt. This also went well with the right medicines. \nI must wholeheartedly thank Dr Pavan Chebbi and his team for all this. \nI write this review with a normally functioning knee now!",

I finally got my arthroscopic surgery done. It has been approx. 3 months and the improvement is phenomenal! \nHe answered to all my queries, even the silliest ones. \nEven my mother consulted with him for her knee pain and he has given a simple solution with assurance to my mom. She is showing good improvement steadily.  Overall we are satisfied and happy with the treatment. Thank you Sir \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

I am able to perform better than before. The supplements given by him are helping me with pain and stiffness. The best part is he has not prescribed any pain killers. I liked his approach to the problem and would like to recommend him for any sportsman having problems like me.",

It did  not end there, even during the follow-up sessions he explained and gave confidence to my mother to do the correct exercises and the right physiotherapy. My mother is very happy with the outcome even though at one point of time she did not want any surgery to be done.

I had been told that surgery is necessary to fix it but none gave me the confidence of returning to play sports. Dr pavan explained to me in depth the cause and effects of the type of injury I had sustained. And of course he give me a 90% chance of return to play. But to my surprise I am 99.9% better than before and continue to play my badminton, cricket and table tennis. My heartfelt thanks to you sir.",

After years my mother has a fully normal knee and enjoys her daily walks.\nAbsolute transparency and professionalism was displayed by Dr Chebbi yet again. I am extremely pleased with the results of the surgery and would highly recommend him for anyone looking for knee replacement in Bengaluru.",

There was a twang in the knee and after I played football the knee swells up and had problems in movements. One fine day i had a small twist of the knee in the bathroom and the reconstructed ACL tore. With a lot of scepticism I approached Dr Pavan Chebbi because I knew that RE operation was the only option and what if the same thing happens again!! Doctor explained me the reason for the failure and assured me that the new surgery will guarantee a return to normalcy. I went ahead with the surgery and now my knee feels more natural. After 6 months now I have no major complaints. Now i am confident to get back to physical activities. I would like to thank Dr Pavan for his skill and confidence.",

Doctor is very good in understanding the patient's problems. His way of diagnosis is excellent. He makes a proper diagnosis. Usually doctor will not prescribe tests and for confirmation he prescribes X ray if required but not mandatorily. The X ray impression vs doctor's diagnosis will be same. He explains the diagnosis in a layman language. I'll definitely recommend Dr.Pavan for all types of orthopaedics",

We consulted another doctor who was strongly suggesting to go for surgery, without clearly explaining why. We met Doctor Pavan who clearly explained the problem and possible remedies. My mother was not comfortable with surgery, so he suggested the alternative to get plaster done and monitor weekly progress. If it doesn't heal as expected then we will have to go for surgery. Thankfully, it is healing as expected. I had great experience with Doctor Pavan and will strongly recommend him to friends and colleagues.",
