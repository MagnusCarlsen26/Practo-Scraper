I left a message asking for a call back at the OPD department and of course nobody called me. \nI did speak to a couple of junior doctors who were very good, attentive and respectful of my time. Dr Patil came highly recommended and I was very disappointed. His recommendation was that I \"do physiotherapy sincerely\" by which I can only assume he thinks I have not being doing physio for over 6 months, despite not asking me or knowing me at all. Could have spent my time so much better. Between the long lines at payment and fighting through Bangalore traffic and waiting for the doctor, I really would have been better off not seeing him.",

My wife booked an appointment to see Dr. Sharan Patil at 1.40 PM so that she can consult and get his opinion.Firstly Doctor didn't show up for about an hour saying he was on rounds and later went for lunch. The OPD staff was calling us 20 min prior to the appointment asking if we are coming for the appointment and when we showed up before time the Dr is not there for an hour.Secondly his assistants came and took all the reports from wife saying that the nurse will give it back to her.Dr. Sharan came after an hour's wait and didn't even spend 5 min to speak with my wife saying there is no need for surgery and it will heal on its own. My wife was literally walking and talking to Dr he didn't even have time to sit and talk to my wife patiently. When my wife insisted him to provide proper guideline he just denied saying i don't treat reports i treat patients. Without even considering that a person with Broken leg can't visit every doctor for an opinion.Last but not the least and biggest bummer is when the nurse returned all the reports to my wife they had lost one of my prescriptions. Now they are not able to find it and without that i can't claim my bills with insurance company.I would say there is no empathy towards patients and very bad management.",

I left a message asking for a call back at the OPD department and of course nobody called me. \nI did speak to a couple of junior doctors who were very good, attentive and respectful of my time. Dr Patil came highly recommended and I was very disappointed. His recommendation was that I \"do physiotherapy sincerely\" by which I can only assume he thinks I have not being doing physio for over 6 months, despite not asking me or knowing me at all. Could have spent my time so much better. Between the long lines at payment and fighting through Bangalore traffic and waiting for the doctor, I really would have been better off not seeing him.",

My wife booked an appointment to see Dr. Sharan Patil at 1.40 PM so that she can consult and get his opinion.Firstly Doctor didn't show up for about an hour saying he was on rounds and later went for lunch. The OPD staff was calling us 20 min prior to the appointment asking if we are coming for the appointment and when we showed up before time the Dr is not there for an hour.Secondly his assistants came and took all the reports from wife saying that the nurse will give it back to her.Dr. Sharan came after an hour's wait and didn't even spend 5 min to speak with my wife saying there is no need for surgery and it will heal on its own. My wife was literally walking and talking to Dr he didn't even have time to sit and talk to my wife patiently. When my wife insisted him to provide proper guideline he just denied saying i don't treat reports i treat patients. Without even considering that a person with Broken leg can't visit every doctor for an opinion.Last but not the least and biggest bummer is when the nurse returned all the reports to my wife they had lost one of my prescriptions. Now they are not able to find it and without that i can't claim my bills with insurance company.I would say there is no empathy towards patients and very bad management.",

The whole meet with Dr. Sharan was just for around 20 seconds and this is not an exaggeration. They say just a doctor's words have healing capability. If that is true then in that aspect the doctor failed miserably. We have paid Rs. 800 for consulting the senior doctor,not the juniors. The doctor however senior he might be needs to respect the patient. We waited for 2 hours to see the doctor and for what to see him for just 20seconds?. **** * *** **** ***** **** *** **** **** ***** Not expected of the doctor when we are paying him to see us.
