On the day of visit, she was in severe pain and I visited the hospital with prior appointment. My mom wasn't in a position to sit or stand due to pain. The Nurse told I have to go inside doctor's cabin after 2 patients, so we were waiting anxiously. However, the doctor has a woman asistant who comes out to call patients every time. I am sure, she follows no appointment order and calls inside people to see the doctor, whomever she likes. So we could see that people came in 5 mins ago and met the doctor, but we waited like for 1.5 hours. Meanwhile my mom was facing much more trouble due to pain, so I confronted the woman. She went to see the doctor inside, then came out and told \" doctor said to go to emergency dept, if you can't wait\". I was totally shocked at such unprofessional behaviour from staff of Columbia Asia. We waited for 1.5 hours and when I demanded my Mom to be checked, the lady comes and tells us to go to emergency. If that is the case, then why wa-ste our 1.5 hours and tell us that our no. is after 2 patients? Also, while sitting there and observing closely, I could see that the lady would come out and call South Indian patients irrespective of their appointment time to visit the doctor first. Afterwards, she calls other patients. **** * ******* ******Finally, when we met the doctor, he did all check up and read reports and suggested \"Microdiscectomy\" surgery for my Mom. As it was a shock for us, I asked him to give us 2 days time to discuss and take the call. So the doctor asked that lady to take my number and call on Saturday w.r.t the surgery decision. Ironically, she never called in-spite of noting down my number at the doctors cabin and I didn't have any other contact to speak personally to the doctor. Anyways, I was furious with the behaviour of such callous staff of Columbia Asia.\n\nFinally, I visited another good and reputed hospital in the same vicinity. ** ***** ******* **** **** *** *** ** ****** **** ** *** ***** ********* *** ******* *** ***** **** **** ***** **** ***** ************ ***** ***** ******** *** ***** ******** ** ***** ******* I would never visit such hospital and such doctor *** ***** **** ************** ****** ** ***** ******* ***** Anyways, loss is theirs and I got my mom treated **** at another hospital.\n\nP.S: The doctor was good but, when he asked us to go to emergency; it was a true let down. If someone is seriously ill and waited for 1.5 hours to see you, you need to understand the pain of the person and not dismiss them like some false case. Also, he might not be aware of his helping hand 'the lady' who lacks basic humanity and follows no rules. ",

On the day of visit, she was in severe pain and I visited the hospital with prior appointment. My mom wasn't in a position to sit or stand due to pain. The Nurse told I have to go inside doctor's cabin after 2 patients, so we were waiting anxiously. However, the doctor has a woman asistant who comes out to call patients every time. I am sure, she follows no appointment order and calls inside people to see the doctor, whomever she likes. So we could see that people came in 5 mins ago and met the doctor, but we waited like for 1.5 hours. Meanwhile my mom was facing much more trouble due to pain, so I confronted the woman. She went to see the doctor inside, then came out and told \" doctor said to go to emergency dept, if you can't wait\". I was totally shocked at such unprofessional behaviour from staff of Columbia Asia. We waited for 1.5 hours and when I demanded my Mom to be checked, the lady comes and tells us to go to emergency. If that is the case, then why wa-ste our 1.5 hours and tell us that our no. is after 2 patients? Also, while sitting there and observing closely, I could see that the lady would come out and call South Indian patients irrespective of their appointment time to visit the doctor first. Afterwards, she calls other patients. **** * ******* ******Finally, when we met the doctor, he did all check up and read reports and suggested \"Microdiscectomy\" surgery for my Mom. As it was a shock for us, I asked him to give us 2 days time to discuss and take the call. So the doctor asked that lady to take my number and call on Saturday w.r.t the surgery decision. Ironically, she never called in-spite of noting down my number at the doctors cabin and I didn't have any other contact to speak personally to the doctor. Anyways, I was furious with the behaviour of such callous staff of Columbia Asia.\n\nFinally, I visited another good and reputed hospital in the same vicinity. ** ***** ******* **** **** *** *** ** ****** **** ** *** ***** ********* *** ******* *** ***** **** **** ***** **** ***** ************ ***** ***** ******** *** ***** ******** ** ***** ******* I would never visit such hospital and such doctor *** ***** **** ************** ****** ** ***** ******* ***** Anyways, loss is theirs and I got my mom treated **** at another hospital.\n\nP.S: The doctor was good but, when he asked us to go to emergency; it was a true let down. If someone is seriously ill and waited for 1.5 hours to see you, you need to understand the pain of the person and not dismiss them like some false case. Also, he might not be aware of his helping hand 'the lady' who lacks basic humanity and follows no rules. ",

However that where all positive end. **** ***** ** ***** ** ***** ******* ****** ****** ***** **** ** ** ***** ***** ******** After taking consultation fee they charge special surgeon fee of 1200 if you do pop( extra material and nursing charge also). So basically give Rs2500 for every dressing plus any material charge. Never any other hospital I have seen that they charged surgeon fee extra of consultancy for fixing slab ( which nurses do). Please avoid this doctor, there are other good doctor in same hospital.",
