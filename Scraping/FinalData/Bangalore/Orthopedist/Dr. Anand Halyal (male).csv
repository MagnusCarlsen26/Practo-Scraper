"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Hand Pain Treatment,Neck Pain Treatment,",0,0,NO,"Took my wife for a  neck and shoulder issue as she had sever pain, also some knee issue and wanted to consult a doctor. So booked an appointment for 12 PM consultation through Practo and reached 10 mins early. There was quiet a crowd.  After multiple follow up with the receptionist, and being told to wait 10 mins every time I asked, we decided to leave after 40 mins wait since we noticed people who came after us were being let in. That's when the doctor called us and asked us to wait 2 mins as he would finish up .  Firstly he was annoyed that we had booked an appointment online and said he doesn't take new patients on weekends. But option to book online appointment was available for everyone. Secondly he hurried through without proper check up or listening to the issue and recommended some tablets or pain injection. didn't want to check knee issue as ""we were in a hurry and not ready to wait"". Was rude and asked us to come back Tuesday when he was free.  All in all , 1. the consultation was done in about 5 mins ( Practo slot was 15 mins) .2.  All the issues were not heard to or addressed, were asked to come back after 2 days. 3. With the hurried check up process, came back with more pain after check up than before , with issue not solved or anything suggested to satisfaction and cost Rs600. 4. Was rude and expressed his displeasure for booking an appointment on days he doesn't accept new patient, but the slot was clearly available online and accepted by them at reception through Practo. they could have just disabled the slot or informed at the reception when we visited so we didn't have to either wait or we could actually consult who was ready to help. **** ** *** ***** ******* ****** * **** ******* ** ***** * **** **** *******",2021-11-07 10:13:10,False,False,naveen02p0921@gmail.com,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",,0,0,YES,"Dr.Anand is the most patient friendly, humble doctor i have ever seen. 
Nowadays, most of the doctors are busy and by the time, we finish speaking  two sentences, they will come to a conclusion and start writing prescription. But Dr.Anand is an exception to it. He listens to all that the patient has to say, examines properly and only then he starts explaining about the problem. 
One day, i noticed at the reception, a man said that he doesn't have enough money for consultation and asked if it is still possible to get a consultation from the doctor. They immediately accepted his request and the doctor attended to him.
Also, in general, Dr.Anand gives so much respect to every patient. He ensures that all his staff also treat the visitors special.

Somedays, the lobby gets really full and my observation is that at the reception, they do not tell the real waiting time for the patient. They assure that they will be seen very shortly and some patients end up waiting for more than an hour even. Some people get annoyed by the false hopes given on the waiting time. This is the only practice to be improved.
