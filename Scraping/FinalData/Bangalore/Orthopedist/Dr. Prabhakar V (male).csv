,,0,0,YES,"Had booked an appointment for my father who had severe pain and swelling around ankle. It was Sunday and out of the very few  Dr.Prabhakar & Dr.Nizam was available. The doctor identified the issue as soon as he saw and confirmed the same with X-ray and Blood test, both these are available at the hospital itself.  The doctors  explained the issue and solution clearly without any rush. Would definitely recommend the Doctors.

Hospital definitely needs to work on few things such as easy access to wheelchair, my father had difficulty walking and wheelchair was not available immediately and before they got it he walked to the sitting area. The waiting time is 20-30mins even if you’ve taken appointment.
