She gave us the list of tests that were required and told us to immediately send in the reports for her Perusal. She immediately put her on the required medication and have to admit my daughter is feeling so much better since. Her energy levels have gone up and is in a good frame of mind - it\u2019s good to see her doing better. Thank you Dr for a quick prognosis. I would recommend her to all my friends who have children.
