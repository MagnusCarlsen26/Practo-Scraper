,,0,0,YES,"Very detailed and specific approach by the doctor to address the ailment for my son. In my case it was skin and gastro related for my 9 week old son and he patiently explained the reason in depth, made us understand and gave the right prescription for the same. Highly recommended pediatrician to have video/remote consulting for your child in these times of lockdown in the covid pandemic situation. Attitude of the doctor was friendly and genuine and we felt at ease and felt better post the consultation online with him. 5 star rating fron our end.
