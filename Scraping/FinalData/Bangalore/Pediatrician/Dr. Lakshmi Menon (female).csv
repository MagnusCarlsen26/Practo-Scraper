"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Child specialists ,",0,0,NO,pathetic experience. Dr.lakshmi was so rude and not having patience to listen to the problem statement. Right from beginningshe was speaking in a higher tone and felt like talking my mother in-law. Huge generation gap.. I was about to highlight about my sons  issue to her. In one sentence she made me stop that other dermat is looking at it. Thought as she is elderly person she would have that empathy to towards the patients.Most of all as a doctor she haven't spoken a single word to my 4 year old son to see check his mental growth.*** **** *** * ******* ******** **** ********** *** **** * ** ** *****,2022-04-26 20:04:58,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
