Going forward with a couple of sessions, I have gone through some ups and downs with the services over there. The best part is that the doctor never writes any unwanted tests. Based on the requirements, a very few tests are suggested until now. Considering the open market price, Manipal bills are slightly high for medical tests. So that can be customised as that will influence the patients in a better way. Other than that, probably the waiting time is a little complicated. The appointments are not streamlined. Since the schedules are not strictly implemented, we can't expect the appointment on mentioned time. Apart from that, I am happy with everything else. **** ** ***** ** *** ********** ** ** **********",

So that can be customised as that will influence the patients in a better way. Other than that, probably the waiting time is a little complicated. The appointments are not streamlined.
