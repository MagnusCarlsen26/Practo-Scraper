The first visit for my baby was scheduled on 12th of March with Dr Prashanth Kumar, while my review after my normal delivery was on 14th of March. During the first visit, my baby was underwent check for jaundice and a blood test was done to check for the jaundice range. After two hours, we got the result which proved my baby doesn\u2019t have jaundice. And the doctor suggested that his next visit is on 20th of March and that I just visit him when I visit my gynaecologist which is on 14th of March. On the day of my visit, after my check up, I tried too hard to meet Dr Prashanth who in fact had asked me to visit him. After waiting for an hour, he came out of his cabin and I stopped him and reminded him that he had asked me to visit him. All that he said to me was get the baby checked for jaundice and pay the consultation fees. Mind you, the baby\u2019s next visit is scheduled on 20th of March. What does this mean? ******* ***** *** ** ********* I walked out of the hospital and visited him again on 20th where he confirmed baby doesn\u2019t have jaundice and I addressed my concerns of my baby throwing up milk along with phlegm and then mucous making him difficult to breath. Every single time that I visited him which over three times- all three times he said the baby is fine. ** *** ** ****** ** ** * ********* *** ** ******",

During the first visit, my baby was underwent check for jaundice and a blood test was done to check for the jaundice range. After two hours, we got the result which proved my baby doesn\u2019t have jaundice. And the doctor suggested that his next visit is on 20th of March and that I just visit him when I visit my gynaecologist which is on 14th of March. On the day of my visit, after my check up, I tried too hard to meet Dr Prashanth who in fact had asked me to visit him. After waiting for an hour, he came out of his cabin and I stopped him and reminded him that he had asked me to visit him. All that he said to me was get the baby checked for jaundice and pay the consultation fees. Mind you, the baby\u2019s next visit is scheduled on 20th of March. What does this mean? ******* ***** *** ** ********* I walked out of the hospital and visited him again on 20th where he confirmed baby doesn\u2019t have jaundice and I addressed my concerns of my baby throwing up milk along with phlegm and then mucous making him difficult to breath.
