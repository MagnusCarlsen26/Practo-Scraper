I had to deliver my baby at 29 weeks and he had explained the risks and uncertainties that might occur after my baby is born in the most composed manner which helped me and my husband remain sane. He has a unique way of first solving the problem and letting the parents know about it later. His confidence and friendly positive attitude throughout the daily counselling sessions helped us remain calm. He was always patient in giving detailed explanations whenever we had any doubts. My now happy 10 month old was in NICU for almost a month and I was lucky that he was in safe hands.  ",
