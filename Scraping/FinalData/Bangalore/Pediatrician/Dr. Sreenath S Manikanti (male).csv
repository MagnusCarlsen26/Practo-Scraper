"Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,Doctor friendliness,","Paediatric Critical Care,",0,0,YES,"My baby was 15 days old and he had passed blood in stool. This is due to providing formula feed (Similac advanced) along with my feed (as my feed was  insufficient). We immediately consulted the doctor and he changed the formula feed to Nutramigen. The blood in the stool has stopped but however I observed that he had discomfort in digestion and he started to mourn, when I took him to doctor I understood that he is not only intolerant to lactose but also to cow's milk protein.  We did the required tests and the result was positive. Doctor switched to Neocate from Nutramigen and the baby is fine with this feed. Simultaneously I had to stop consuming milk and curds as the baby is not able to digest. This has resolved the feed issue.

Also due to my hormonal changes he had neonatal acne and the doctor suggested Atogla and Ritch lotion to subside the itchiness and red rashes that had occured on his face. I could see the results in a day's time and my baby stopped crying

Normally clinic is open at 10 AM , so if patient arrives early they can wait in the waiting area. That day was an exception. 
When doctor saw you , you didn‚Äôt inform the doctor that ur consultation was prepaid in Practo. All prepaid customers should scan QR code in the clinic so that Consultation is paid to the doctor by Practo. That was also not done. Hence you were charged Consultation Fee + Vaccinations. We charge all vaccinations on MRP & we don‚Äôt charge any additional amount. In fact doctor had showed u the vaccination boxes & exact price, same was charged to you. We‚Äôve kept the video recording of the same. 
When we realised in the evening that it was supposed to be prepaid after generating the detailed billing by our receptionist , we apologised for the oversight & promptly refunded the extra amount to you over google pay.

I very rarely prescribe antibiotics and your son presented with a massive lymph node swelling in the neck which needed antibiotics. I generally prescribe very less investigations , however your child case was different. Whenever child presents with such a massive swelling it‚Äôs always prudent to investigate to find out the cause. Simply giving antibiotics without any tests can sometimes mask underlying disease such as TB or Malignancy. Hence I recommended the tests, which are standard protocol in any good hospital. Also majority of kids who present with such massive swelling may not respond to oral antibiotics, which is a fact.",2023-05-08T14:25:47+0000,Dr. Sreenath S Manikanti
