It had been a while since his injections and we requested the Dr to do it with care and he was so nice to oblige. I am so grateful to him for treating my 8 year old in a way that he felt it was not a bad experience to get injections.  Highly recommend the Dr for his patience and his pleasant way to treat children.  Thank you Dr. ",
