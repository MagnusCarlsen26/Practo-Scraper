"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Pediatric Vaccinations,",0,0,NO,We had been consulting with the doctor from birth till 5 months. She is someone who believes I’m not giving unnecessary medications to the baby which is good. But she isn’t very friendly. It’s very difficult for new parents to ask her questions. She is rude at times. She is undoubtedly a good doctor but a little more patience and friendliness would help. That’s the reason I changed the pead for my baby. ,2021-11-24 11:59:09,False,False,Sneha,,,
