Very difficult to get such * **** doctor who is so patient, sympathetic, listen to our problem without getting irritable. He will prescribe medicine and tests as less as possible even if you insist. Inspite of being an allopathic doctor he will still suggest home remedies to treat simple ailments naturally. \nMajority of doctors I have seen have lost their touch with nutrition and basics of human health. They just try to treat symptoms but Dr. Praveen is different.\n\nMy daughter had growth issue and she was not able to sleep more than 10 min at a shot and we were so worried. I changed so many doctors but I was not satisfied with the answer of anyone. I met  Dr Praveen coincidently because I missed appointment with an scheduled doctor. I just told him my daughters problem and he gave one answer and I was like 'Full Stop'  to all my questions and my search for a perfect doctor stopped forever . He answer was so logical. And now I refer to him for both of my kids.",

They just try to treat symptoms but Dr. Praveen is different.\n\nMy daughter had growth issue and she was not able to sleep more than 10 min at a shot and we were so worried. I changed so many doctors but I was not satisfied with the answer of anyone. I met  Dr Praveen coincidently because I missed appointment with an scheduled doctor. I just told him my daughters problem and he gave one answer and I was like 'Full Stop'  to all my questions and my search for a perfect doctor stopped forever . He answer was so logical.
