But the only objection I have towards the hospital is that they charged me 700 bucks for my second session in which I just wanted to show the blood test reports. What I was informed was that after 3 days of my primary consultation, I will be charged the regular fees again. But they have not mentioned it earlier. It seemed pointless. The rules and formalities should be even more considerate otherwise it causes complete despair in patients.",
