She was born about 3 weeks back and Since its my first baby, I had no idea about anything to do with a newborn. But Dr. was there throughout to help us out with everything, from how to take care of a newborn, to treating her for some medical issues. He was extremely meticulous with her treatment. Most importantly, he strongly stressed upon treating her by natural means rather than giving her medications and unnecessary medical interventions. He explained every step along the way and this to me was what established the trust completely. I generally tend to stress a lot over small things but he was very patient with my stress levels and never ending questions. He is really friendly, cooperative and approachable. During these tough times with respect to covid-19, we were highly apprehensive about Stepping out of the house with the baby. But Dr. Shashidhar was kind enough to help us out over the phone for most part. I would be more than happy to refer anyone I know to Dr. Shashidhar. Thank you so much Doctor for all the help. ",
