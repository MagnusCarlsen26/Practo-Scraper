"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Growth & Development Evaluation / Management,",0,0,YES,"What to say, not getting enough words to describe him. Very difficult to get such * **** doctor who is so patient, sympathetic, listen to our problem without getting irritable. He will prescribe medicine and tests as less as possible even if you insist.
