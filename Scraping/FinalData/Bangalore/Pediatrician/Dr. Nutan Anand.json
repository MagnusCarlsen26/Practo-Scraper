She isnt bothered if you are convinced or your concerns are put to rest. \n- We also had to get vaccination done for my baby during covid-19, But as per the process we were asked to do video consultation with the doctor. And then doctor says she is not available for vaccination. This could have been informed to us by staff before fixing appointment or atleast the doc could have handled this better by forwarding us to another doctor who was available in same hospital.  Did not like the way the doctor handled this. \n- Overall, not worth the high fee we pay at the hospital. Doctors at clinics give  us much much better experience than this. \n\nNot recommended",

She isnt bothered if you are convinced or your concerns are put to rest. \n- We also had to get vaccination done for my baby during covid-19, But as per the process we were asked to do video consultation with the doctor. And then doctor says she is not available for vaccination. This could have been informed to us by staff before fixing appointment or atleast the doc could have handled this better by forwarding us to another doctor who was available in same hospital.  Did not like the way the doctor handled this. \n- Overall, not worth the high fee we pay at the hospital. Doctors at clinics give  us much much better experience than this. \n\nNot recommended",
