                "reply_text": "Thank you for your feedback. Let me assure you that your feedback has been well taken. The same was conveyed to you when I reached out to talk to you last week. Our therapists are well qualified and experienced in dealing with children with developmental difficulties. If it seemed like one of them was insensitive, pl accept our apologies. \n\nWe did call you several times after the initial 5 days for report discussion, but your number was not reachable, there was no response or switched off. I myself called you several times to get the same response, you were not reachable. I finally managed to reach you after trying several times on different days.\nWhen  we meet again for report collection, it is a standard follow up practice to enquire how the child has been and if there has been any changes since the last meeting. Many parents report changes in two months, improvements or other difficulties. The same follow up question was asked, perhaps misunderstood. \nAlso depending on the distance to our centre from their homes, parents many times opt to go for centres closer to their homes for therapy while continuing to follow up regularly with us. We help them by giving address of other centres closer to their homes as we know it is impossible for people to travel long distances in Bangalore traffic. The same was suggested to you considering the distance. If we do not have any centre known to us in a particular area, we ask parents to also look for such therapy centres close to their residence so that no further delay takes place in accessing therapy that is needed. We keep a database of such centres in and around Bangalore and also in other cities and towns. \nIf we are able to help anyone in any way we do so to the best of our professional ability and we are one of the centres ( except for trust or Govt. hospitals like, Institute of speech and Hearing,  SSK or NIMHANS) most reasonably priced for all assessments and therapies and offer flexibility of payment options namely online payment, payment by session for our therapy sessions and unlike many centres who collect payment in advance for whole year, for several months, etc. Our assessments are standard universal practices and all our staff who carry out assessments have masters degrees from reputed Universities. Once again thanks for your feedback and the opportunity to clarify from our side.\nIf you have any queries, pl do not hesitate to contact us. Best wishes.",

                "review_text": "You generally approach a medical center or child growth development center with a hope or something to look forward to. You may generally be vulnerable or sensitive expecting a moral or overall support if not for the normal course of medical or scientific course of support.\n\nWaiting area: Progressive Milestones is a Child Development center and sadly they are insensitive to handle children and/or their parents. An example of an incident at this center I would like to narrate. We were waiting for the doctor to arrive and my child was playing in the waiting area. During the course she noticed a kids playroom, where there was one kid playing with the ball. My child was attracted to it and went inside the room to play with the other kid. Apparently there was another doctor attending to that kid in that room and was not happy with my child getting in. We were also unaware that there was probably a session going on. What we noticed later was the doctor pushing my child out of the room and pulling the ball from my child\u2019s hand, leaving my child in tears and upset. Nevertheless we apologised to the doctor for obstructing the session, but we were bit shaken by the sheer attitude of the child psychologist\u2019s behaviour in handling the situation insensitively. This was our upsetting moment number 1.\n\nThe receptionist: We got our child assessed for her development after paying a premium. Expected time to receive the report was 4-5 days as conveyed by the receptionist herself. I called back the center to know the status of the report after one week. The receptionist did not mince any words and was blunt to say that it is not ready yet. I inquired why the delay, she responded saying that it is not like any blood test report, it takes time and that I shall be intimated. I felt she could have told that in a better way. When you are dealing with your child\u2019s development assessment and bit desperate, when you hear such unpleasant responses it actually upsets you. This was our upsetting moment number 2.  With such attitude towards handling their customers and their business, I lost interest to pursue any further, but the guilt of having paid a premium without receiving the report made me contact them after 2 months, yes that is pretty much of a delay. They did contact me once to arrange a consultation for the report review, but they did not pursue much. After all, it is not their requirement anyhow. Progressive Milestones does not accept credit cards or cashless transaction. They deal only through cash even for the expensive assessments and tests.\n\nThe doctor: As many has observed, the doctor is stiff and stern. I doubt if a child would be able connect well with the doctor. A paediatric growth development specialist is a very challenging role. The countenance or the overall approach and attitude is not welcoming and comforting as a parent and of course for the child. After receiving the report and seeing her after two months since her assessment and after reading the report, the question she had was on us. What is the status? Is there any improvement or development? We were confused, since we did not undergo any therapy yet and were there expecting her expert analysis of the report, guidance and way forward. But that literally put us off and lost hope of what we could expect from this center and doctor. My hard earned bill and time off my work went down the drain with no firm or solid support or guidance regarding the matter. This was my ultimate and the final upsetting moment. However she has suggested to consult some other centers if I know of which is close to my residence.\n\nI shall not recommend this place for your child\u2019s development needs or intervention.\n",

Our therapists are well qualified and experienced in dealing with children with developmental difficulties. If it seemed like one of them was insensitive, pl accept our apologies. \n\nWe did call you several times after the initial 5 days for report discussion, but your number was not reachable, there was no response or switched off. I myself called you several times to get the same response, you were not reachable. I finally managed to reach you after trying several times on different days.\nWhen  we meet again for report collection, it is a standard follow up practice to enquire how the child has been and if there has been any changes since the last meeting. Many parents report changes in two months, improvements or other difficulties. The same follow up question was asked, perhaps misunderstood. \nAlso depending on the distance to our centre from their homes, parents many times opt to go for centres closer to their homes for therapy while continuing to follow up regularly with us. We help them by giving address of other centres closer to their homes as we know it is impossible for people to travel long distances in Bangalore traffic. The same was suggested to you considering the distance. If we do not have any centre known to us in a particular area, we ask parents to also look for such therapy centres close to their residence so that no further delay takes place in accessing therapy that is needed. We keep a database of such centres in and around Bangalore and also in other cities and towns. \nIf we are able to help anyone in any way we do so to the best of our professional ability and we are one of the centres ( except for trust or Govt. hospitals like, Institute of speech and Hearing,  SSK or NIMHANS) most reasonably priced for all assessments and therapies and offer flexibility of payment options namely online payment, payment by session for our therapy sessions and unlike many centres who collect payment in advance for whole year, for several months, etc. Our assessments are standard universal practices and all our staff who carry out assessments have masters degrees from reputed Universities. Once again thanks for your feedback and the opportunity to clarify from our side.\nIf you have any queries, pl do not hesitate to contact us. Best wishes.",

                "review_text": "You generally approach a medical center or child growth development center with a hope or something to look forward to. You may generally be vulnerable or sensitive expecting a moral or overall support if not for the normal course of medical or scientific course of support.\n\nWaiting area: Progressive Milestones is a Child Development center and sadly they are insensitive to handle children and/or their parents. An example of an incident at this center I would like to narrate. We were waiting for the doctor to arrive and my child was playing in the waiting area. During the course she noticed a kids playroom, where there was one kid playing with the ball. My child was attracted to it and went inside the room to play with the other kid. Apparently there was another doctor attending to that kid in that room and was not happy with my child getting in. We were also unaware that there was probably a session going on. What we noticed later was the doctor pushing my child out of the room and pulling the ball from my child\u2019s hand, leaving my child in tears and upset. Nevertheless we apologised to the doctor for obstructing the session, but we were bit shaken by the sheer attitude of the child psychologist\u2019s behaviour in handling the situation insensitively. This was our upsetting moment number 1.\n\nThe receptionist: We got our child assessed for her development after paying a premium. Expected time to receive the report was 4-5 days as conveyed by the receptionist herself. I called back the center to know the status of the report after one week. The receptionist did not mince any words and was blunt to say that it is not ready yet. I inquired why the delay, she responded saying that it is not like any blood test report, it takes time and that I shall be intimated. I felt she could have told that in a better way. When you are dealing with your child\u2019s development assessment and bit desperate, when you hear such unpleasant responses it actually upsets you. This was our upsetting moment number 2.  With such attitude towards handling their customers and their business, I lost interest to pursue any further, but the guilt of having paid a premium without receiving the report made me contact them after 2 months, yes that is pretty much of a delay. They did contact me once to arrange a consultation for the report review, but they did not pursue much. After all, it is not their requirement anyhow. Progressive Milestones does not accept credit cards or cashless transaction. They deal only through cash even for the expensive assessments and tests.\n\nThe doctor: As many has observed, the doctor is stiff and stern. I doubt if a child would be able connect well with the doctor. A paediatric growth development specialist is a very challenging role. The countenance or the overall approach and attitude is not welcoming and comforting as a parent and of course for the child. After receiving the report and seeing her after two months since her assessment and after reading the report, the question she had was on us. What is the status? Is there any improvement or development? We were confused, since we did not undergo any therapy yet and were there expecting her expert analysis of the report, guidance and way forward. But that literally put us off and lost hope of what we could expect from this center and doctor. My hard earned bill and time off my work went down the drain with no firm or solid support or guidance regarding the matter. This was my ultimate and the final upsetting moment. However she has suggested to consult some other centers if I know of which is close to my residence.\n\nI shall not recommend this place for your child\u2019s development needs or intervention.\n",
