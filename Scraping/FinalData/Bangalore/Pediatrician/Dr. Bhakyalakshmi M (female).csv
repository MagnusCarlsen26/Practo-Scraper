,,0,0,YES,"I would like to take time to write proudly my thanks to Dr. Bhakyalakshi M for detecting An atrial septal defect (ASD) is a hole in the heart between the upper chambers (atria)
I actually visited her for Fever, Cold, Caugh for my kid, she heard Whooshing sound that can be heard through a stethoscope (heart murmur). 
Got chest X-ray, and ECHO as she had some doubt in her mind of ASD.
I was actually had bad experience of most of the corporate hospital doctors as they do unnecessary tests and increase our expences for no good reasons , but she proved it wrong me wrong in my case. And it's our luck at for the age of 4.5years only we got to know about he had heart defect. Tomorrow is discharge for my kid in Whitefield Manipal Hospital, I don't want to write some genuine highlights of good experiences, this somewhere helps to others and doctor both.
