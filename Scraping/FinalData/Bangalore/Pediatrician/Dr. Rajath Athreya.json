That time we met Dr. Rajat Athreya & team,who became saviours of my child's life. The way the treatment given by them was extraordinary. The confidence and the counselling given to the parents was awesome. They have given a new life to my child and to us as well. I thank each and everyone of the hospital staff for their extraordinary treatment. I recommend everyone for their neonatal issues and fertility issues as well.",

So it's not fair to say that Dr. is unnecessarily pushing for hospitalization. In fact in our case the cold was so severe we thought hospitalization might be necessary. But Dr. Rajath assured us that it will not be needed and prescribed some medicines which cured our daughter eventually. ",

The confidence and the counselling given to the parents was awesome. They have given a new life to my child and to us as well. I thank each and everyone of the hospital staff for their extraordinary treatment. I recommend everyone for their neonatal issues and fertility issues as well.",

So it's not fair to say that Dr. is unnecessarily pushing for hospitalization. In fact in our case the cold was so severe we thought hospitalization might be necessary. But Dr. Rajath assured us that it will not be needed and prescribed some medicines which cured our daughter eventually. ",
