He provides maximum possible natural way of treatment unless it\u2019s really necessary to go for medicinal options for new born baby. I like this approach.

However Dr. Mallesh is not that kind, he clearly assess the actual problem and provide solid solution for the same. Due to this pandemic situation he provided good video consultation whereas my baby\u2019s umbilical cord issue is resolved now. Thanks for your support.",
