"Explanation of the health issue,","Pediatric Vaccinations,",0,0,NO,"I do believe he is a good doctor but I was truly disappointed with the vaccination experience for my baby. I am not sure if this should be attributed to the doctor or the hospital. If there is a way I can give thumbs up to my consultation experience separately, I would have done so.I went for 7th month vaccination which was just influenza shot. Even before consultation, nurse came with the prescription to buy vaccine which was surprising as up until then, vaccine is prescribed only after clearing the baby. When the vaccine amount was high, we were surprised as it was only supposed to be influenza. But with vaccine bought, we went to see the doc where we asked if it’s just influenza and he said no we are doing typhoid as well. He said your book is outdated (trust me it’s been only 7 months since the baby was born), now typhoid should be given btw 6-12 months and we at cloud nine give it at 7th month..we weren’t too sure abt it but we are not experts and doctor is saying this and he has not given us an option to think about it coz we were told to buy the vaccination before consultation. So this is my problem here. We are coming here for our baby’s immunisation and we want the best for her but there is a level of trust that needs to be established and that was not there. If doctor is going outside the book, shouldn’t the parents be aware of it before purchasing the vaccination. Then the parents can actually digest that information and probably ask for time to wait on this particular vaccine, just saying.
