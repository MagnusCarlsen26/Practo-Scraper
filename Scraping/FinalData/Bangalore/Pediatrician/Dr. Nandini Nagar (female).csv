"Doctor friendliness,","Children's Health,",0,0,NO,"I visited doctor for the ear piercing of my baby after waiting for a long duration of one hour. Even though it was told to be a painless procedure, the baby was continuously crying for the next 2 hours. 

The earring that I purchased from the Cloudnine hospital was of inferior quality and it fell off the baby’s ear the very next day. Since I didn’t get the appointment of the doctor the next day, I had to visit after 3 days. When I took the appointment, the doctor told that  the baby might have pulled the ear due to which the earring might have fallen off wherein the earring was pretty loose which I can confirm of. I paid around 5-6k for the entire procedure and she told me to wait for another
months to get it  redone. Very rude attitude and demeanour",2024-06-03 07:33:22,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
"Treatment satisfaction,","Paediatric Critical Care,",0,0,NO,"Hello everyone, I would like to share my experience and kindly advise against choosing a particular doctor for newborns, or infants aged 3 to 6 months. In my experience, this doctor lacks the necessary skills to effectively treat children of this age group. She appears to offer advice without proper consideration and lacks the patience required to care for young children. I recommend avoiding such doctors to ensure the well-being of your babies. It's important to be mindful and make informed decisions regarding your child's healthcare.",2024-06-01 10:26:08,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
