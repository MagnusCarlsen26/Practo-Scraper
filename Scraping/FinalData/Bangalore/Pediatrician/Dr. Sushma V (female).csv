"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Children's Health,",0,0,YES,"Dr.Sushma has been my son's pediatrician since his birth. He is 3yrs old now and I am very satisfied with her diagnosis every time. She is a very friendly and approachable doctor, so much so that son who is 3yrs old willing visits her every time and tries explaining the symptoms himself( however he can and how much ever he can :) ). She is a very good listener and does not prescribe any additional tests or antibiotics unlessl really necessary. Most of the times roots for household remedies. She is very gentle with kids as well, my son does not throw tantrums even during vaccination visits.",2020-02-23 18:01:18,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
,,0,0,Yes,"My daughter is one year old now and Dr. Sushma V is taking care of her medical concerns. Going forward with a couple of sessions, I have gone through some ups and downs with the services over there. The best part is that the doctor never writes any unwanted tests. Based on the requirements, a very few tests are suggested until now. Considering the open market price, Manipal bills are slightly high for medical tests. So that can be customised as that will influence the patients in a better way. Other than that, probably the waiting time is a little complicated. The appointments are not streamlined. Since the schedules are not strictly implemented, we can't expect the appointment on mentioned time. Apart from that, I am happy with everything else. **** ** ***** ** *** ********** ** ** **********",2020-01-17 08:31:23,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
