She talks to the point and always answers all the questions asked to her. after catching covid in 5th month of pregnancy, we observed some missing heartbeats in my baby. so we consulted her. She looked at my entire history of pregnancy patiently and asked me why did I visit her. After the tests were done, she asked me that I don't need to visit her again. And advised me not to take any medicine which is not pregnancy friendly. I really appreciate her honest opinion and her advice. She is a great doctor who is not after money. I am very glad that such doctors exist in this world who are not after money. I am very impressed with her.",
