Doctor Suvarna madam could gave us complete clarity and confidence to us that it's not dengue pls rest be assured no need to go for any tests. We were so impressed with madam advice as it was so helpful for us to take further action being parents and also suggested us not to go for any antibiotics that really talks about doctor involvement with the patient.We highly impressed with Doctor Suvarna madam and we suggested to our neighbours, relatives & friends about madam. We thank once again Doctor Suvarna madam for guiding us in right direction as madam diagnosed our son correctly.Thank you madam once again.",

Doctor Suvarna madam could gave us complete clarity and confidence to us that it's not dengue pls rest be assured no need to go for any tests. We were so impressed with madam advice as it was so helpful for us to take further action being parents and also suggested us not to go for any antibiotics that really talks about doctor involvement with the patient.We highly impressed with Doctor Suvarna madam and we suggested to our neighbours, relatives & friends about madam. We thank once again Doctor Suvarna madam for guiding us in right direction as madam diagnosed our son correctly.Thank you madam once again.",
