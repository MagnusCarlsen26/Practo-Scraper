"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Type 2 Diabetes Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I have been visiting the Doctor from about 8 years. It started with high Gestational diabetics but eventually I got to know that I am type -2 diabetic. I have delivered two babies through normal delivery under her guidance. She is so supportive with me through out this 8 yrs giving encouragement and support and lead me in proper direction in controlling diabetics. When I am not caring for myself and taking care of kids more, she made me understand how important is mothers health to take care of baby and brought me back in track. She visited me personally to check how I am doing in the delivery room. This means a lot to me. She did not restrict to just giving me medicines. She treated me as a child. For me she is walking GOD. Without her proper direction I couldn't deliver my kids safely and with proper health. ",2022-05-23 06:36:29,False,True,Usha Madhavi Pratapa,,,
