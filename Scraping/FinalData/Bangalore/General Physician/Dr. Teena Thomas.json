She gives you information that you need and nothing more. She is patient to answer all your questions and also a good counsellor for when you have apprehensions and worries. One big help was her availability over messages for times when I had some challenges during pregnancy and also post delivery. \n\nPersonally the fact that my age (37) didnt bother her and she never mentioned it or questioned me about why I/we waited so long before getting pregnant etc was very comforting. She also instilled confidence in me, by not scaring me with the usual 'Oh this is a G3 pregnancy, there could be complications.. etc etc..'  \n\nMy delivery was also normal, she didnt push for a Ceserean delivery, allowed me to go through 14 horus of labour and yet when I almost gave up, she stood by me and encouraged me to go through with the process and thanks to her, I delivered a normal healthy baby girl, who is amlost 2 months old today. \n\nWe will be eternally grateful to Dr. Teena for her support and guidance through my pregnancy, delivery and post delivery journey. God bless you Doctor!",

It\nwas always us who said, we are done with questions :)\n4. Very supportive, very understanding, ma'am ensured we feel\nlike home when talking to her\n5. She prescribes very less and only needed medicines\n6. Her focus/priority is normal delivery, and not cesarean.\nAlthough in our case, my wife couldn't have a normal delivery,\nbut that has nothing to do with the doctor.\n7. Ma'am gave good enough time to my wife during the delivery\n8.

It was subchorionic hematoma of considerable size(>50%). Dr. Teena handled the situation very sensitively and accurate to the point where her expert diagnosis of the condition helped us sail till very end of this journey. The journey after 14th weeks was tough due to multiple other complications but Dr. Teena oversaw every bit of it closely and very carefully. It\u2019s easier to get depressed with this kind of situation at hand but with Dr. Teena you are in for a treat. The way she handled the situation with her expert medical advice and guided us, we never felt stressed because Dr. Teena brings in a sound medical advice with a composed persona. I\u2019ve never met a doctor who is not only the expert at her field but goes all-in for a patient\u2019s care. At times, we called her at 3 AM in the morning and she wouldn\u2019t think twice before picking up the call and guided us.\n\nDr. Teena has enormous attention to detail, medical accuracy and excellent interpersonal communication. As a patient what more one would expect? I\u2019ve always had a peculiar complaint off doctors in India that they don\u2019t spend enough time with patients; Dr. Teena proved me utterly wrong. She is not only a compassionate doctor but an expert in her field. She knows what she is doing and does it with ease. I was amazed to see her knowledge and philosophy of practising evidence based medicine which was not only effective but was boon in case of my wife\u2019s complicated pregnancy since we could not have afforded to go wrong at any stage. Dr. Teena explains you the possible diagnoses in detail and doesn\u2019t rush into a decision without your comfort; she is simply amazing at dealing with patients in the most humane way.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be an overstatement that doctors are God for patients; Dr. Teena is indeed one for us. If it was not for her then we couldn\u2019t have made to where we are today.  Thanks to her that we are blessed with beautiful twins. Thanks Dr. Teena for everything you have done and gave us such beautiful and everlasting joy and memories to cherish for our lives! ",

Teena mam gave us all the hopes and was very supportive. She took special care and did not prescribe unnecessary medications. She ensured that my wife was naturally conceived. Throughout the pregnancy she was very friendly and reachable all the time even on phone. By the last trimester we got to know that AFI is decreasing and hitting lower limit. Even then the doctor was very calm and composed which made us stay positive. She tried her level best for normal delivery but we had to go for C section as the baby was finding it difficult to breath. We are blessed with a baby boy and it's all because of the extra care and support that the doctor provided. It's not only the treatment that she provides, its actually the time, care, counseling she provides makes her the best out of others. Me and my family are very grateful to her. Of course, we strongly recommend Dr. Teena. \n\nThe hospital nursing department is doing an exceptional job. The patience and attention they show is truly appreciable. Our baby was admitted in NICU for almost a week due to low birth weight. It was the toughest time for us. The care and kindness the NICU nurses showed actually boosted our hope and made us believe that our baby is in the right hands. They understand the stress each parents go through and answer any queries even if you keep bugging them. Me and my family will never forget their service and will always have that respect towards them.",

She would not only avoid unnecessary tests/meds, but also calmed us down whenever we panicked. Within a couple of consultations, our stance shifted from going hometown for delivery, to delivering wherever she is available.\n\nDr. Teena came has not just an OBG for us, but also a guide, friend who we could approach anytime and everytime (even when she was on vacation), and to top that she herself followed up on questions asked over phone/ text. A good human being, a great mother makes her the best of her lot. She treats each pregnant women personally and ensures they  carry a smaile at all times and talks them through the issues- not all OBG would care this much. Also, she has gone beyond just OBG duties to help us in emergency situation for our newborn.\n\nIf you're consulting her, be ensured you're in safe hands.",

She has asked us to get done some basic which was resulted positive. Looking at our age factor, she has advised us for fertility treatments. She played a good mentor role at every stage. As per her suggestion we have attempted two fertility treatments but some time you get success in harder way. Outcome was not in our favor. \nFamily members were insisted to get further treatment at Mumbai. There we strongly disagreed, the doctor, who was mentoring us as family member, who was praying to god for us, how can we discontinue her treatment. We wanted get treatment under her till last hope.\nDay came, GOD has decided to fulfill our wish. We received positive result for pregnancy test. We were at MUMBAI for attending family function. We were super excited and jumping with joy. We were eager to share this happy movement with Dr. Teena. I have alone travelled to Bangalore since my better half was asked to take rest for few weeks. I remember that day, when I conveyed the new to her (Dr. Teena), I have seen her happier and relaxed for us. There were no second thought of delivering a baby elsewhere. We wanted to bring our bundle of joy under her treatment/supervision only. \nHer support was excellent. She had explained us about each step of treatment / medicines. For our every question, she had always given explanations. Many occasions, we have received answer for the question asked on whatapps chat also. For us she was available to us anytime / every time.\nFinally, there was end to tensions and worries. Few days back we are blessed with baby boy. Really it is a beginning of a wonderful journey of parenting. \nWe are very much thankful to Dr. Teena Thomas for all her help. We really want to appreciate her support, guidance at every step, personalized attention.",

She gives you information that you need and nothing more. She is patient to answer all your questions and also a good counsellor for when you have apprehensions and worries. One big help was her availability over messages for times when I had some challenges during pregnancy and also post delivery. \n\nPersonally the fact that my age (37) didnt bother her and she never mentioned it or questioned me about why I/we waited so long before getting pregnant etc was very comforting. She also instilled confidence in me, by not scaring me with the usual 'Oh this is a G3 pregnancy, there could be complications.. etc etc..'  \n\nMy delivery was also normal, she didnt push for a Ceserean delivery, allowed me to go through 14 horus of labour and yet when I almost gave up, she stood by me and encouraged me to go through with the process and thanks to her, I delivered a normal healthy baby girl, who is amlost 2 months old today. \n\nWe will be eternally grateful to Dr. Teena for her support and guidance through my pregnancy, delivery and post delivery journey. God bless you Doctor!",

She prescribes very less and only needed medicines\n6. Her focus/priority is normal delivery, and not cesarean.\nAlthough in our case, my wife couldn't have a normal delivery,\nbut that has nothing to do with the doctor.\n7.

It was subchorionic hematoma of considerable size(>50%). Dr. Teena handled the situation very sensitively and accurate to the point where her expert diagnosis of the condition helped us sail till very end of this journey. The journey after 14th weeks was tough due to multiple other complications but Dr. Teena oversaw every bit of it closely and very carefully. It\u2019s easier to get depressed with this kind of situation at hand but with Dr. Teena you are in for a treat. The way she handled the situation with her expert medical advice and guided us, we never felt stressed because Dr. Teena brings in a sound medical advice with a composed persona. I\u2019ve never met a doctor who is not only the expert at her field but goes all-in for a patient\u2019s care. At times, we called her at 3 AM in the morning and she wouldn\u2019t think twice before picking up the call and guided us.\n\nDr. Teena has enormous attention to detail, medical accuracy and excellent interpersonal communication. As a patient what more one would expect? I\u2019ve always had a peculiar complaint off doctors in India that they don\u2019t spend enough time with patients; Dr. Teena proved me utterly wrong. She is not only a compassionate doctor but an expert in her field. She knows what she is doing and does it with ease. I was amazed to see her knowledge and philosophy of practising evidence based medicine which was not only effective but was boon in case of my wife\u2019s complicated pregnancy since we could not have afforded to go wrong at any stage. Dr. Teena explains you the possible diagnoses in detail and doesn\u2019t rush into a decision without your comfort; she is simply amazing at dealing with patients in the most humane way.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be an overstatement that doctors are God for patients; Dr. Teena is indeed one for us. If it was not for her then we couldn\u2019t have made to where we are today.  Thanks to her that we are blessed with beautiful twins. Thanks Dr. Teena for everything you have done and gave us such beautiful and everlasting joy and memories to cherish for our lives! ",

Teena mam gave us all the hopes and was very supportive. She took special care and did not prescribe unnecessary medications. She ensured that my wife was naturally conceived. Throughout the pregnancy she was very friendly and reachable all the time even on phone. By the last trimester we got to know that AFI is decreasing and hitting lower limit. Even then the doctor was very calm and composed which made us stay positive. She tried her level best for normal delivery but we had to go for C section as the baby was finding it difficult to breath. We are blessed with a baby boy and it's all because of the extra care and support that the doctor provided. It's not only the treatment that she provides, its actually the time, care, counseling she provides makes her the best out of others. Me and my family are very grateful to her. Of course, we strongly recommend Dr. Teena. \n\nThe hospital nursing department is doing an exceptional job. The patience and attention they show is truly appreciable. Our baby was admitted in NICU for almost a week due to low birth weight. It was the toughest time for us. The care and kindness the NICU nurses showed actually boosted our hope and made us believe that our baby is in the right hands. They understand the stress each parents go through and answer any queries even if you keep bugging them. Me and my family will never forget their service and will always have that respect towards them.",

She would not only avoid unnecessary tests/meds, but also calmed us down whenever we panicked. Within a couple of consultations, our stance shifted from going hometown for delivery, to delivering wherever she is available.\n\nDr. Teena came has not just an OBG for us, but also a guide, friend who we could approach anytime and everytime (even when she was on vacation), and to top that she herself followed up on questions asked over phone/ text. A good human being, a great mother makes her the best of her lot. She treats each pregnant women personally and ensures they  carry a smaile at all times and talks them through the issues- not all OBG would care this much. Also, she has gone beyond just OBG duties to help us in emergency situation for our newborn.\n\nIf you're consulting her, be ensured you're in safe hands.",

She has asked us to get done some basic which was resulted positive. Looking at our age factor, she has advised us for fertility treatments. She played a good mentor role at every stage. As per her suggestion we have attempted two fertility treatments but some time you get success in harder way. Outcome was not in our favor. \nFamily members were insisted to get further treatment at Mumbai. There we strongly disagreed, the doctor, who was mentoring us as family member, who was praying to god for us, how can we discontinue her treatment. We wanted get treatment under her till last hope.\nDay came, GOD has decided to fulfill our wish. We received positive result for pregnancy test. We were at MUMBAI for attending family function. We were super excited and jumping with joy. We were eager to share this happy movement with Dr. Teena. I have alone travelled to Bangalore since my better half was asked to take rest for few weeks. I remember that day, when I conveyed the new to her (Dr. Teena), I have seen her happier and relaxed for us. There were no second thought of delivering a baby elsewhere. We wanted to bring our bundle of joy under her treatment/supervision only. \nHer support was excellent. She had explained us about each step of treatment / medicines. For our every question, she had always given explanations. Many occasions, we have received answer for the question asked on whatapps chat also. For us she was available to us anytime / every time.\nFinally, there was end to tensions and worries. Few days back we are blessed with baby boy. Really it is a beginning of a wonderful journey of parenting. \nWe are very much thankful to Dr. Teena Thomas for all her help. We really want to appreciate her support, guidance at every step, personalized attention.",

As my case was a bit rare, she took it upon herself to further research before giving a final decision.

Once I got urinary infection pain at early morning 2 am and I waited until 6 am to call her. She said you could have called me before. She takes very much care in suggesting medicines and that even saved my pregnancy. My first pregnancy was a miscarriage and she helped me a lot in that one. Many people suggested me not going there for the second one. But I believed in her and here I am blessed with a healthy baby girl. Thank you so much Teena Mam and I will always suggest you.",

I had done my IUI treatment with her and it fell on the day of Easter Sunday. She still came to the hospital and did the procedure. I was later pregnant with twins. With twins I had a number of complications and she always kept calm which helped me not to panic.She responds on whatapp as well and never once did she get impatient. She always has a smile and that gives you more confidence.It was a wonderful experience with her and would definitely recommend her to my friends.",
