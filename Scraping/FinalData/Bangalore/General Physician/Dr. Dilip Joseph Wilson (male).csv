This is my first Practo review. 

And I am sharing this review  with the motive that this might help someone in distress and need some genuine Medical practitioner.

I found about Dr. Wilson on the practo itself. I was facing fever, severe pain in my ribs & back, sore throat, weakness etc. When I visited Dr. Wilson they was very friendly, listened to me very patiently and seemed very concerned about my health. Their prognosis was very much apt to my condition and my chest/back pain got alleviated in 2-3 days. 

Though few days later I diagnosed with covid. But still, I was continuously in touch with them over phone/whatsapp, and their reverts were instantaneous. Not only this, when I was facing difficulties to get covid medications I approached Dr. Wilson regarding this. They wholeheartedly supported me and arranged medicines for me.

Later my mother also got covid (probably because of me). I again consulted Dr. Wilson ,  and with their help and support my mother is doing and recovering fairly well.

I know I have written very long review, but in my view, even these words falls short to show my gratitude to Dr. Wilson. They are a real life saver. 
A savior for me and my family.
