"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",,0,0,YES,My family and I were tested positive for covid 19. We were in a confused state on how to get treated though we started the treatment at a hospital. Came to know Dr. Uma from my colleague and thought I could get some advice from her. But after talking to her for the first time I got an understanding on the covid and it's timeline as she explained it with a clarity. We decided to drop everything and just follow Dr. Uma. I can say she is our life saviour. Only with her in depth knowledge and guidance we are able to recover from this deadly covid. She saved my father by finding out his condition in advance and treated accordingly. I couldn't even imagine how our life would be if we couldn't get her help. Have never seen a doctor like her.
