And also he asked us for blood test refrence , but didnt gave any antibitotic to be cured soon.",2023-10-25 08:41:59,False,False,Aaron ,"Hello Sir- To your comments, below are some points that I would like to highlight:

1.	You mention that it takes 2-3 consultations at our clinic to get healed. You visited our clinic only once and I prescribed certain medications based on my clinical judgement of your condition at the time of your visit. I had also informed you to contact me if your condition persists or worsens; furthermore, I gave you my personal phone number in case you wanted to reach out to me directly. You neither called nor visited my clinic again so I had no idea about your medical condition since your first and only visit. 

2.	You mention that I only gave you ‚Äúnormal medicines‚Äù which you can get from any pharmacy and that I did not prescribe antibiotics. I would like to mention sir that not all ailments require antibiotics to get cured. You mention that you consulted me for a Flu, and I would like to clarify that a ‚Äúflu‚Äù by definition is viral infection and these most often do not require antibiotics. Based on my clinical evaluation of your condition, if I did not prescribe antibiotics, it was because I felt you did not require antibiotics. The answer to every medical condition is not an antibiotic, and in fact irrational/indiscriminate use of antibiotics could potentially lead to antibiotic resistance- which means that the antibiotic may not work when you need it the most. Had I known your condition was worsening if it was, I would have altered medications as necessary. Medical treatment is often an iterative process, sometimes patients recover immediately, and sometimes things need to be changed as the medical condition evolves, and no one can exactly predict how things may proceed. In my practice, I tend to be judicious with the use of all medications including antibiotics and I use antibiotics where appropriate. 

3.	I did not understand what you meant by blood test reference. If required I may have prescribed certain blood tests based on your medical condition. We do provide lab facilities at our clinic for the convenience of our patients, and patients can choose to avail these facilities as they deem appropriate or get tests anywhere else. So, I really do not understand the context of your comment in this regard.

4.	About the masks- since I examine patients in close proximity, our aim is to minimize contamination of the clinical examination area and to minimize cross infections among other patients/clinic staff. With several upper respiratory infections currently ongoing - H3N2, Possibly COVID, Influenza etc; we request patients to wear masks for safety purposes. If patient‚Äôs/their attenders do not have their own masks we provide these to them at a very nominal amount which is at our cost price, our sole intent being the safety of our patients and staff, not any profitability motive whatsoever.

Just to clarify and for your understanding there are very specific medications like valacicyclovir that are prescribed for chicken pox.  If untreated, chicken pox can possibly cause severe complications; so it would be very unwise to not treat chicken pox and assume it will heal on its own. When we initiate this medication in particular (valacicyclovir) we need to know if the patient‚Äôs renal profile is ok which is why a test like RFT (renal function test) is ordered otherwise the dose of valaciclovir definitely needs to be altered to protect the kidneys. If I do not know what the baseline renal function of the patient is when putting a patient on a medication that may impact the kidneys, I order the RFT for the purpose aforementioned. For patients who have coexisting other symptoms like Fever, throat pain etc we often order tests like CBC and maybe ESR or CRP to check the blood counts and levels of inflammation. Hope this clarifies the medical part of your disappointment. I would like to highlight that I practice medicine very ethically and keep my patient‚Äôs well being of utmost priority. Coming to the administrative part- if you consulted me at Kasper Clinic and if there was a registration charge you were asked to pay; that is something that the clinic may have charged you and I certainly don‚Äôt have any role in this nor do I specifically ask the clinic to collect this registration charge on my behalf; in case the clinic asked you to pay the registration charge again, I will ask them to issue you a refund.",2023-03-01T13:28:09+0000,Dr. Prashant Dinesh

First and foremost, I would like to emphasize that for a physician, asking history about pregnancy, lactation and menstruation from female patients of reproductive age group is an essential requirement and global medical standard for clinical/medical history taking and patient evaluation. This is just as important as it is to know what the patient‚Äôs complaints are, the past medical/surgical history, which medications the patient is taking or is allergic to, family medical history etc.

It is extremely important for a physician to know during a consultation if a female patient of reproductive age group is pregnant or lactating (breast feeding) so that medications that are not supposed to be given during this time are withheld to not cause any harm to a growing fetus or breast fed child. In your case also this information was important to possibly withhold (if needed) certain antibiotics, pain medications, anti histamines or other medications for the same reasons as highlighted above.

Furthermore, irregularities in menstrual cycles may potentially point to other underlying patient medical conditions such as thyroid disorder/PCOD etc. based on which the physician may advise the patient to seek gynecologist opinion and/or provide appropriate treatment plans as deemed beneficial for the patient.

As a physician I consider my responsibility to not only treat the problem on hand but also to ensure that I cause no harm to the patient and help uncover and treat other medical problems that the patient may have.",2023-12-16T11:43:52+0000,Dr. Prashant Dinesh
