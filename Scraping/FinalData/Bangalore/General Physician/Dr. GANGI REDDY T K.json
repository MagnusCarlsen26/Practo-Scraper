I had some issues noticed in the X-ray which he explained to me clearly saying that nothing to worry, it can be treated with medicines. He did not insist on any expensive scan or other tests. He is a polite and approachable doctor. I am  really happy and impressed by his treatment . He has prescribed some medications and was asked to review after 2 weeks. I am feeling better now. Highly recommend Dr. Gangi Reddy for Pulmonary related issues.",

He was bedridden post his admission in the ICU.  There was a point when we lost hope, but Dr.Reddy didn\u2019t give up on my father.He goes out of his way to make sure all your questions are answered and he works with you to address the health concerns rather than just telling you what needs to be done. And also he cares for his patients a lot and follows up for regular update. He is very approachable and walked us through every minute details. Today after almost 1.5 years my father has been able to walk around, can breathe easy and there is no sign of TB. When I see my father today its almost unbelievable that he is the same man who was admitted in ICU and was struggling for his life. It feels like a miracle. We as a family can\u2019t thank Dr. Reddy enough for his relentless support, guidance and encouragement during this entire journey.",

This is when I visited Dr Gangireddy TK. He explained it very well that there is nothing to worry about such PFT results and it is quite expected for people with mild asthma. Instead of stronger oral medication he suggested me milder inhale medication. I could feel remarkable improvement in my breathing and feel a greater lung capacity after undergoing treatment from him. He is a next gen doctor who will explain the issue in detail and would also encourage you to google more about it to have better understanding (not take medication from Google of course!) and suggest small lifestyle changes that will help and to avoid allergents rather than undergoing medication. I would strongly recommend him for respiratory and allergic issues. ",

I had an acute eye infection and was on steroids before visiting him..then my opthalmologist suggested to visit some pulmonologist, then I came to know about Dr Gangi Reddy. He did some blood tests and it was diagnosed that i have eye TB (tuberculosis).. i was surprised to know about my unique condition. Ever since 2months i am under ATT  (Anti Tuberculosis Treatment) .My eyes have recovered...and i no longer need any steroids.\nHowever, I  need to continue ATT as it is a long term treatment to cure TB which affected my eyes..\nI would strongly recomend Dr. Gangi Reddy for his friendly behaviour, explaining me all details and consequences of my treatment.",

He is a polite and approachable doctor. I am  really happy and impressed by his treatment . He has prescribed some medications and was asked to review after 2 weeks. I am feeling better now. Highly recommend Dr. Gangi Reddy for Pulmonary related issues.",

He was bedridden post his admission in the ICU.  There was a point when we lost hope, but Dr.Reddy didn\u2019t give up on my father.He goes out of his way to make sure all your questions are answered and he works with you to address the health concerns rather than just telling you what needs to be done. And also he cares for his patients a lot and follows up for regular update. He is very approachable and walked us through every minute details. Today after almost 1.5 years my father has been able to walk around, can breathe easy and there is no sign of TB. When I see my father today its almost unbelievable that he is the same man who was admitted in ICU and was struggling for his life. It feels like a miracle. We as a family can\u2019t thank Dr. Reddy enough for his relentless support, guidance and encouragement during this entire journey.",

This is when I visited Dr Gangireddy TK. He explained it very well that there is nothing to worry about such PFT results and it is quite expected for people with mild asthma. Instead of stronger oral medication he suggested me milder inhale medication. I could feel remarkable improvement in my breathing and feel a greater lung capacity after undergoing treatment from him. He is a next gen doctor who will explain the issue in detail and would also encourage you to google more about it to have better understanding (not take medication from Google of course!) and suggest small lifestyle changes that will help and to avoid allergents rather than undergoing medication. I would strongly recommend him for respiratory and allergic issues. ",

I had an acute eye infection and was on steroids before visiting him..then my opthalmologist suggested to visit some pulmonologist, then I came to know about Dr Gangi Reddy. He did some blood tests and it was diagnosed that i have eye TB (tuberculosis).. i was surprised to know about my unique condition. Ever since 2months i am under ATT  (Anti Tuberculosis Treatment) .My eyes have recovered...and i no longer need any steroids.\nHowever, I  need to continue ATT as it is a long term treatment to cure TB which affected my eyes..\nI would strongly recomend Dr. Gangi Reddy for his friendly behaviour, explaining me all details and consequences of my treatment.",

Consulted multiple peadiatricians but could not find out the root cause. She was continuously on medicines for almost 2years and could not eat/sleep/play because of cough. \nI myself had a good experience with Dr.Gangi reddy for my allergic problem. I saw him in Add on scan n labs and consulted for my kid. I spent many sleepless nights with my kid and cried so much for my kid's condition. But just in a matter of 1day doctor's  medicines gave relief to my kid. And now its not recurring. I am so happy to see her eat and sleep properly. \nCant thank enough doctor for this change. I highly recommend this doctor for any kind of respiratory problems. ",

The approach to diagnosis was done in a gradual manner. After a few tests it was found that I had DNS and hence referred me to an ENT specialist. Coming to the billing and stuff, I believe the tests conducted were charged a bit more and that's acceptable considering its Bangalore and things are costlier than other metropolitan cities. Overall, I recommend Dr. Gangi Reddy for his positive attitude towards his patients and diagnosing diseases in a systematic manner before arriving at an early conclusion.",

Since then we continue to come to him in spite of the distance from home and proximity to other big hospitals. He is very friendly, very clear and concise about his diagnosis and treatment plan, detailed communication in simple terms on every step of treatment and reason behind his treatment decisions, open communication on options. Takes time to talk freely to the patient (my father is 74) and make him comfortable on each visit. It was also easy to share records and reports to him to avoid/reduce visits.\nWe are quite pleased with his treatment and my father recovered well. We would highly recommend him.",

All these took at least 15 mins. \nSince you were in disagreement, I said our customer care team to return your consultation fees and advice you to consult any other doctor of your choice.\n        An acutely breathless patient who would need immediate treatment will not be able to talk 2-3 sentences also comfortably.
