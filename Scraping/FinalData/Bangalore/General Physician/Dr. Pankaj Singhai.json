She has been taking treatment for RA at Manipal Hospital, Old Airport Road, Bangalore, since 2008.\n\nWhen her health deteriorated, with multiple problems in 2014, my father approached Dr. Pankaj Singhai in 2014. Considering her chronic condition, he had prescribed a low dosage and administered commensurate treatment and gradually brought her to a normal level and set her health right, and saved her life. Since then she is under the treatment of Dr. Pankaj Singhai and he has been treating her with an appropriate dosage. On account of his treatment, my mother is active today. \n\nThe holy proverb \u201cDoctor is next to God\u201d appropriately applies to him. \n\nI and my father have advised our relatives, friends, and associated colleagues to approach Dr. Pankaj Singhai for better treatment. \n\nI and our family are indebted to the doctor for the exemplary medical care he has given to my mother.",

It\u2019s just not about his accurate analysis and medication, it is also about the confidence he puts in my head to make sure I\u2019m getting the right treatment. Also he tells a lot about managing small episodes of gastric and fever at home by taking right medicines and not to run hospital each and every time which is highly recommended. A charming and friendly person who doesn\u2019t recommend unnecessary tests and medicines but a lot of trust to make sure you\u2019ll be treated right . Took a long time to finally write a valid review but longer the better . I highly recommend him and make sure your appointments are booked well in advance to avoid longer waiting period at Manipal .",

Considering her chronic condition, he had prescribed a low dosage and administered commensurate treatment and gradually brought her to a normal level and set her health right, and saved her life. Since then she is under the treatment of Dr. Pankaj Singhai and he has been treating her with an appropriate dosage. On account of his treatment, my mother is active today. \n\nThe holy proverb \u201cDoctor is next to God\u201d appropriately applies to him. \n\nI and my father have advised our relatives, friends, and associated colleagues to approach Dr. Pankaj Singhai for better treatment. \n\nI and our family are indebted to the doctor for the exemplary medical care he has given to my mother.",

Whenever I\u2019ve a condition where I\u2019m unwell mostly due to fever and gastric or any other ailment then I run to him and trust me when I walk out from chamber I\u2019m calm, cool and composed. It\u2019s just not about his accurate analysis and medication, it is also about the confidence he puts in my head to make sure I\u2019m getting the right treatment. Also he tells a lot about managing small episodes of gastric and fever at home by taking right medicines and not to run hospital each and every time which is highly recommended. A charming and friendly person who doesn\u2019t recommend unnecessary tests and medicines but a lot of trust to make sure you\u2019ll be treated right . Took a long time to finally write a valid review but longer the better . I highly recommend him and make sure your appointments are booked well in advance to avoid longer waiting period at Manipal .",

The Medicines made her condition worse, that's where I decided to move to another hospital and Manipal was the first preferred choice. \n\nDr Pankaj with initial examination scrapped the previous medicines and confirmed with super confidence that he'll take only 5 days to treat her.\n\nShe was admitted and started with another treatment course and got discharged on the 5th day and it has been 3-4 months and she is perfectly fine now.\n\nI was amazed and speechless with gratitude. ** ** ****** * ***** ****** *** *** * ****** *********** ",
