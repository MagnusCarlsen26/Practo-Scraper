,,0,0,YES,"During my health check at Apollo clinic in Jul 2022, I was diagnosed with CKD.
I was consulted by Dr Mary Susan K S.

She insisted that I take my ailment seriously and get admitted to a good hospital.

I highly recommend Dr Mary for her high standard of treatment, the way of communicating the ailment, dedication and empathy for patients.

Her diagnosis and insistence to pursue the treatment is helping me towards the path of recovery.
