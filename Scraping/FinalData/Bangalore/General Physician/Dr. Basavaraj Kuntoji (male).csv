,,0,0,Yes,"He made my treatment as simple as it could be. His explanation about the problem assessment was too good. I am very much impressed with his way of approach. I obtained maximum results out of prescribed medications in estimated period. For the consultation, I should have to wait around 30 minutes as I was quite behind the queue. But overall consultation was comfortable and satisfactory.",2020-01-22 09:31:37,False,True,Krishna,,,
,,0,0,Yes,"Although I won't visit him on a regular basis, I am consulting him from the year 2015. I'm very happy with his guidance and have obtained an extreme satisfaction with his treatment. All these years with Manipal has been a very good experience. It takes time for the consultation depending on availability but still it has never bothered me anyway.",2020-01-27 09:43:48,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
