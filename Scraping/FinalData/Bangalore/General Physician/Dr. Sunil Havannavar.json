My brother in law was treated by him and his group at Columbia Asia on covid related issues.  He literally gave him a new life. I'm a pharmacist in the USA and have been in close contact on how he was being  treated at Sagar hospitals where he was not only  treated horrible but also had to experience life threatening conditions as a result of the treatment he recieved at Sagar (Sagar hospital hasn't followed any basic protocols related to his covid treatment)\nDr. Magesh Balakrishnan (Cardiologist) is my brother in laws life saver who insisted on joining him at Columbia Asia and after which my brother in law was truly saved by all their efforts.  He guided us throughout and we are so grateful for all his efforts and guidance!\nMy family can't thank them enough and forever indebted to these great doctors! \nThe treatment was to the point and very efficient.  Thank you  the whole columbia asia doctors!\n",
