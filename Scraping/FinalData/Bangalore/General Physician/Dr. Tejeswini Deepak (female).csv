"Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",,0,0,NO,"Dear team,

It's been more than an hour, I am waiting for a meeting with doctor.

It seems it's first come first serve , no benefits of booking it through practo. It's frustrating and top of that they are asking me extra money for registration. I am highly disappointed with practo. You should have made it clear in the beginning itself that they goona charge extra fees which is of no use to me in future.
Though they have made bill at 6:36 but my consultation has not started yet. They are very clever and so as practo.
