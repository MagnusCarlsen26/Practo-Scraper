"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Stomach Pain,",0,0,YES,I was having severe stomach ache on Sunday 14 th Feb 21 since 4 PM. I consulted in Emergency clinic of the hosp at 2 AM on night of 14th/15th. There was not much relief. Next day on 15th Feb pain was still continuing and I consulted Dr Prabha Ramadurai at Nano hisp at 1245 PM. She thouroughly examined my stomach area and advised for immediate Ultrasound scan as she suspected inflammation of appendix. She also advised me to consult a surgeon immediately if the appendicitis is confirmed. I underwent the scan at 4 PM and it revealed the same problem. I got admitted at 5 30 PM same day at Fortis hosp and the surgery was done on 16th. The doctor's correct diagnosis and timely advise helped me to take proper action.
