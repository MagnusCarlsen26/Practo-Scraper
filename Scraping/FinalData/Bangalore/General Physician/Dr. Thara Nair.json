They sugggested me the best package they had, which covered most of the checks at a very reasonable price.I did not literally have to wait a extra minute to consult the doctor.The Doctor was very patient enough to expalin things clearly and also that the suggestions that were given was something simple that i could follow easily. The best part was that I was not directly given list of medications at a go, but instaed the doctor has given me sometime where i can get few things into control naturally, only if i fail to do so, i will be prescribed for medcations from the next visit. I am truly satisfied!Good Hospital, Good and friendly Staff with Great Doctors.",

The best part was that I was not directly given list of medications at a go, but instaed the doctor has given me sometime where i can get few things into control naturally, only if i fail to do so, i will be prescribed for medcations from the next visit.

I visited thrice but no staff available over the weekend and on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe next day when the staff was available, they charged me another Rs.100 just for monitoring the BP. (no doctor available.)\r\n\r\nOverall it was horrible experience paying Rs.750, visited 5 times and no relief.",
