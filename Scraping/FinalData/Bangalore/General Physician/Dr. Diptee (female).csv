"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,",,0,0,YES,"Actually, during July first week, I was suffering from fever, cough and cold. Fever was coming within every 5-6 hrs and also I was having throat pain. Then Doctor suggested for Covid test. Within a day, she has arranged for sample testing. The lab person was sent to my home. After a day, I got my report of Corona Positive. After getting positive report, BBMP person has called me for shifting to the hospital. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a bed in private hospitals. At that time, I talked with the doctor. After talking with me and getting my health information, she suggested that I could be treated at home only. She provided all medication and she herself has come to my society to deliver those medicines. She used to daily take information about my health and accordingly changing medicine dosages. Ultimately, after 14 days she suggested a re-test for me. That was also arranged in a day and then finally I got my Covid Negative report. I will always be thankful to her for her dedication, care and treatment provided to me. Basically, she saved my life from Corona and also saved me from going for outside hospitalization.
I truly appreciate her.
Thanks
