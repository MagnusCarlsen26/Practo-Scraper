"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Diabetes Treatment,",0,0,YES,"It’s been 3 months for me under the consultation of Dr. Shilpa Singi. I met her when I was diagnosed with Diabetes and was really tensed because of getting diagnosed in my early 30s. Dr. Shilpa instantly made me comfortable and had a great empathy. She gives enough time to patients and develops a great bond. After 3 months of treatment and significant improvement in my health be it my noticeable weight loss as a result of diet and workout suggested by her or be it my diabetes being in control, I want to heartily thank Dr. Shilpa for her treatment, help and instilling confidence in me. I wish we have more such calm, patient and understanding doctors around.  This is my warm recommendation for Dr. Shilpa",2020-11-28 06:59:55,False,True,Manish Kumar,,,

It is not technically correct to write multiple medicines irrelevant in a clinical scenario. 
The focus has to be 
for a priority problem that in your case is fever and cold cough 
There is one more follow up “free” when you can again come and discuss your issues !!
Medically  the problem at hand has to be taken care and it should not be mixed with many months long and year long issues it makes the treatment process and understanding easier for the patient !",2023-02-23T13:42:58+0000,Dr. Shilpa Singi
