"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I cannot express enough how grateful I am for the incredible care that my wife received from Dr. Thejaswini. From the very first visit to the last, Dr. Thejaswini has been an absolute godsend. Her dedication to her patients and her unwavering commitment to their well-being is truly remarkable.

First and foremost, Dr. Thejaswini's warm and compassionate demeanor immediately puts patients at ease. She takes the time to listen attentively, addressing all concerns and questions with patience and empathy. This level of genuine care goes a long way in reducing the anxiety that often accompanies visits to a gynecologist.

What sets Dr. Thejaswini apart is her exceptional ability to educate and empower her patients. She took the time to explain every aspect of my wife's treatment, making sure we fully understood the options and decisions ahead. This transparency was invaluable in helping us make informed choices regarding our healthcare.

One of Dr. Thejaswini's most remarkable qualities is her conscientious approach to medical care. She firmly believes in not prescribing unnecessary medicines or tests. She said ""You don't need a doctor; you need a dietician first,"" embodies her commitment to addressing the root causes of health issues rather than relying solely on medications. This approach demonstrates her dedication to the long-term health and well-being of her patients.

Thank you, Dr. Thejaswini, for being the incredible doctor that you are, and for making such a positive impact on our lives.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Was fortunate enough to find her. What a gem of person and professional ma’am is. 

She was consulting doctor through my wife’s pregnancy and there was no one better I could’ve wished for. Now I will tell my reason in the most layman’s perspective 

1. Very grounded in her approach and would only make the necessary recommendation in terms of medicines or scans, so one can be assured if Dr has prescribed it then it is of utmost importance and not for the pharmacy or the scan clinics profits as sometimes people are apprehensive about.

2. Listens and encourages you throughout your journey, without you ever feeling if she is rushing into things

3. Approachable for people from all kinds of economic strata in the society.

4. Will never hint at or even make a passing reference of C Section unless absolutely necessary, will encourage you and give your tips for natural delivery right from day 1.

5. She helped us naturally deliver a healthy baby boy in Columbia Asia Sarjapur after my wife went in labour 24 hours after her water broke. She insisted on not going the c section route or even giving epidurals as she said that the vitals are all good and natural route is best one at this stage even when my wife said that the pain was unbearable, she held her hand and encouraged her to be the most comfortable position to push, which the nurse weren’t allowing (squat position).
