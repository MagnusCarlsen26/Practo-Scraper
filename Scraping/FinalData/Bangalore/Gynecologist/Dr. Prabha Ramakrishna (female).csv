"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pregnancy,",0,0,NO,"*** ** **** *********** *** ******* **** ********* ** ********. My experience -  This is my 2nd pregnancy, based on my NT scan, she recommended going for a NIPT test and the report was negative. She told everything is fine, nothing to worry about. When I did my anomaly scan in the 20th week of pregnancy, some soft marker was still there, we were very worried and needed honest & clear counseling. Then she is telling us that NIPT doesn't make sense as the fetal fraction count is less and the baby has a chance of chromosomal abnormalities and we don't have any options now. She made us cry the whole night and was worried and stressed for 2 weeks. ** **** *** *** * * ***** ******* **** ******* ******* * *** ******** ******* **** **** *** **** ** ******** *** ******* ** ***** ****** *** **** ** **** *** ***** ** ** **** ** ** **** ***** *** ** *** ** ******* ***** **** **** ****** *** ******** **** **** ** *** ******* ***** ***** **** **** ********* *** **** ******* ** ******* ** ********** * *** ****** ** *** * **** ********* ****** *** *** **** *** *** ** ***** **** *** **** ******* * ******* **** **** This was our mistake and I would never want anyone to go through this experience.
