Instead of providing immediate assistance, she insisted on making an appointment, even though it was clearly urgent.\n Overall, Dr. Murthy's lack of attention, disinterest, and unavailability during crucial times made the entire experience highly unsatisfactory.\nI would advice all the people to think twice before visiting her .",

On the second visit, she was in a rush to leave, again on her phone, and spent a mere five minutes with us.\n The final straw was when I had an emergency, and she was nowhere to be found. Instead of providing immediate assistance, she insisted on making an appointment, even though it was clearly urgent.\n Overall, Dr. Murthy's lack of attention, disinterest, and unavailability during crucial times made the entire experience highly unsatisfactory.\nI would advice all the people to think twice before visiting her .",
