I would rate her more than the best.. (if any category is available like that)if you are looking for a good gynaec and obsterician.. I think you can just go ahead with her.. don have 2 thoughts about it at all.. ",

She gave me some tablets that helped but time spent in trying to explain what was actually going on with me was zero. In fact when I simply asked \"What exactly should I tell a dietitian if they ask me what my condition is\" rather than stating what was going on or taking the time out to explain things to me, she just brushed it off and said \"Show them your scan they will get it\". She has zero concern for trying to make the patient understand what is going on. Apart from this, time spent in general is extremely limited, looks like she's always in a hurry to get somewhere and she's doing us a favor? Terrible. My experience with her today broke the camels back which prompted me to go out of my way to create an account on Practo just to post this. She prescribed me some medication *** * *** ****** * *** **** **** ******** ********* *** ****** ***** **** **** ***** **** **** *** ***** ***** ***** *** ***** *** ********* *** ** **** Savitha's actual visit in itself is as short as a 2min phone call.. but rather than saying what I needed to do she said she would have to see me even before hearing what I had to say.. Before I could ever talk about what happened she told me I needed to come down to the hospital. ********* ***** **** ***** **** ** ** *** *** ****** \n\nIn summary, she does not explain the problem at hand, brushes things off and does not talk about what to do unless asked *** **** *** **** **** *** ** ********** *** ********\n",

I would rate her more than the best.. (if any category is available like that)if you are looking for a good gynaec and obsterician.. I think you can just go ahead with her.. don have 2 thoughts about it at all.. ",

She gave me some tablets that helped but time spent in trying to explain what was actually going on with me was zero. In fact when I simply asked \"What exactly should I tell a dietitian if they ask me what my condition is\" rather than stating what was going on or taking the time out to explain things to me, she just brushed it off and said \"Show them your scan they will get it\". She has zero concern for trying to make the patient understand what is going on. Apart from this, time spent in general is extremely limited, looks like she's always in a hurry to get somewhere and she's doing us a favor? Terrible. My experience with her today broke the camels back which prompted me to go out of my way to create an account on Practo just to post this. She prescribed me some medication *** * *** ****** * *** **** **** ******** ********* *** ****** ***** **** **** ***** **** **** *** ***** ***** ***** *** ***** *** ********* *** ** **** Savitha's actual visit in itself is as short as a 2min phone call.. but rather than saying what I needed to do she said she would have to see me even before hearing what I had to say.. Before I could ever talk about what happened she told me I needed to come down to the hospital. ********* ***** **** ***** **** ** ** *** *** ****** \n\nIn summary, she does not explain the problem at hand, brushes things off and does not talk about what to do unless asked *** **** *** **** **** *** ** ********** *** ********\n",

I am not wasting time here. \n\nHospital facilities people are forcing doctor to finish appointment with patients soon,  so that other patients need not wait much. \n\nI know Dr savitha madam,  she is very responsible towards a patient,  she never does time pass with patient. I request the hospital authority,never force doctor to finish the patient appointment soon. \n\nI request hospital to have clean and smell free restroom in -1 floor. \n\n",
