"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Ovarian Cyst Removal,",0,0,YES,"I am a 21-year-old who first experienced severe abdominal pain and was in and out of hospitals during my final exams. I was given medication for two cycles, was diagnosed with a hemorrhagic cyst, finished my medicinal course, and then met them for a follow-up check. When an ultrasound disclosed nothing, they had to perform a trans-vaginal scan. I was feeling fine until I discovered that I had a dermoid, which, to my dismay, was twisted. I went to Dr. Deepak for a second opinion after the first doctor told me that the only option left to me was surgery. 
Dr. Deepak gently broke the news to me that I would undoubtedly need surgery after taking the time to explain about what went wrong with me. He gave me a lot of encouragement throughout and was quick to address my silly concerns. My surgery was indeed successful, and my recovery thereafter wasn't too difficult too. He has managed to keep my anxiousness in check, and I am genuinely delighted with my experience. He is an incredible doctor with high experience and is excellent at what he does.   
I am truly pleased with my experience. He is a fantastic doctor with deep expertise who excels at what he does.",2022-08-31 15:16:28,False,True,Lalitha Shree,,,
