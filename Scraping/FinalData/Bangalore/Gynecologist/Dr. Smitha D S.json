Not only is Dr.Smitha blessed to have the patience in answering to all my myriad stupid-silly questions but she also successfully got my frantic mum calm down who was panic stricken with my diet .lol. Yes, and it isn't easy to convince my mum unless you're qualified enough:DShe's also been like that coach who gives you that punch of motivation when you're getting it all wrong. Yes, I've had times when I wasn't too regular with my exercises and skipped my meds cause of my schedule but she's always there with an internal checklist  and give you the facts and get you back on track. She's a cool gynaec who know's her game. You go gal!!\ud83d\ude0e So all you ladies out there..if you want somebody to take you through this bitter sweet experience called pregnancy and make it less stressful and more positive  then you need someone like Dr.Smitha. Totally recommend her!! (P.S I didn't get paid to talk like this)",

She also did not put me on high medicines since it wasn\u2019t really required and I completely appreciate that. Because hormonal tablets can cause the body to change. I was very impressed when after the check up she told me to get back to her after the dosage days are completed  to inform her on my health. She was friendly, ************* and caring though my problem was just a beginning. Trust happens when you are told the right thing without hiding or missing out on points. That is what has happened to me with her. I am glad I have had the opportunity to be under her guidance for my health issue. I would definitely recommend her to my friends and family. ",

Yes, and it isn't easy to convince my mum unless you're qualified enough:DShe's also been like that coach who gives you that punch of motivation when you're getting it all wrong. Yes, I've had times when I wasn't too regular with my exercises and skipped my meds cause of my schedule but she's always there with an internal checklist  and give you the facts and get you back on track. She's a cool gynaec who know's her game. You go gal!!\ud83d\ude0e So all you ladies out there..if you want somebody to take you through this bitter sweet experience called pregnancy and make it less stressful and more positive  then you need someone like Dr.Smitha.

I was very impressed when after the check up she told me to get back to her after the dosage days are completed  to inform her on my health. She was friendly, ************* and caring though my problem was just a beginning. Trust happens when you are told the right thing without hiding or missing out on points. That is what has happened to me with her. I am glad I have had the opportunity to be under her guidance for my health issue. I would definitely recommend her to my friends and family. ",
