Throughout our fertility journey there were times I felt emotionally drained, but doctor  always made me feel that giving up was not an option. Her kindness and compassion have been such a blessing! Dr. Arockia always kept us informed during the entire treatment process and often took the time to personally call us to check on us. She is very knowledgeable, understanding and comforting. She was very patient with me & my husband and our many questions. Words can\u2019t express our gratefulness but our hearts can. Dr. Arockia will always have a special place in our heart! Thank you will never feel like enough. I highly recommend Doctor Arockia for all fertility treatment and Gynaecology treatment ",

Finally, I made a decision and prayed to God to show me a doctor and thats when I found Dr. Arockia. I always feel god is treating me through her, I believe she is god sent into our life. Right from the start, she is so kind, gave me lot of confidence whenever I was down. She is the person I can even cry to. \n\nEvery step of my medicine, tests, and consultation she stepped down to check with me always and remind me of what I have to do. She is always reachable for me and in touch with me on whatsapp and calls. She is soo soo kind and the treatment that she gave me was very well planned and explained to me and my husband from the start and finally I got conceived. She always makes sure I am comfortable. \n\nMillions of Thanks are not enough for Dr. Arokia and I thank god for sending Dr. Arokia as my angel into our life. God Bless her and the Medical team. ",

Right from the start, she is so kind, gave me lot of confidence whenever I was down. She is the person I can even cry to. \n\nEvery step of my medicine, tests, and consultation she stepped down to check with me always and remind me of what I have to do. She is always reachable for me and in touch with me on whatsapp and calls. She is soo soo kind and the treatment that she gave me was very well planned and explained to me and my husband from the start and finally I got conceived. She always makes sure I am comfortable. \n\nMillions of Thanks are not enough for Dr. Arokia and I thank god for sending Dr. Arokia as my angel into our life. God Bless her and the Medical team. ",

She makes you feel so comfortable. \n\nThis is a very emotional and physically draining journey which is difficult to go through unless you have the right doctor with you. Dr. Arockia has been so patient in explaining every single doubt and was always available on whatsapp and calls. Having a caring and down-to-earth doctor has really made our life easier during this difficult phase and made our journey successful.

She leaves no stones unturned in the treatment provided and also values and understands the emotions of the patients considering that the entire IVF jounery at times is stressfull and emotionally draining. She instills hope in every situation in the patient. You can trust her judgement and treatment without an iota of doubt. Most importantly, she provides the right advise at the right time and values the patient and never hides anything from the patient. After succesfull treatment under her care and guidance, I'm happily pregnant with my first child after years of wait. Me and my family will always be indebted to her. May God bless you and your family in abundance and you continue to re-create magic in lives of many couples struggling with Fertility issues.",

Your thorough diagnosis and understanding of our situation made all the difference. You made us feel confident and reassured throughout the entire process eventhough we had failed attempts through OI & IUI. We know that IVF is a difficult and emotionally draining process, but you made it as smooth and stress-free as possible. We were particularly impressed with your ability to explain the process in detail and answer all of our questions about endometriosis.  \n\nWe are so grateful for your expertise and compassion. Unlike our previous experience with other doctors, your expertise and appropriate treatment approach led to a successful outcome. We also appreciate your willingness to go the extra mile by answering texts over whatsapp to make sure that my wife was comfortable and safe. Thank you for making this journey smoother.\n\nThank you.",

I am very happy that I consulted Dr Arokia at the right time and she is truly god sent. She handles all the queries with a smile on her which makes the patients comfortable to ask all the questions without hesitation. The overall experience with Dr Arokia was very pleasant and positive.

She was so calm throughout and understood my issues completely. That made me feel good. Atleast I tried to get rid of the fear, which I wasn\u2019t able to do it earlier.  Her friendliness and care make  us feel confident on the process. *** ** **** ************** You can reach the doctor at any time over WhatsApp and you will get immediate response. The time she takes during every visitation to listen to us makes me feel better.  Thanks to the care given by the doctor.  I will surely recommend her. \n\nAll the staff in the hospital deserve kudos. They all will make you feel so cared. ",
