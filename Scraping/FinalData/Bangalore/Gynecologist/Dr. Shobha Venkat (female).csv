Dear Shobha ma‚Äôam,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for your extraordinary care and support throughout my pregnancy journey. Your unwavering dedication, expertise, and compassion have truly made all the difference in bringing my precious bundle of joy into this world.

From the very beginning, you instilled confidence in me and encouraged me to aim for a normal vaginal delivery. Your motivation and reassurance helped me overcome my fears and anxieties, empowering me to embrace the birthing process with courage and optimism. Your commitment to promoting natural childbirth and your belief in my ability to achieve it were incredibly motivating and reassuring.

Throughout the prenatal visits, you patiently addressed all my concerns and provided invaluable guidance, ensuring that I felt informed and empowered every step of the way. Your gentle demeanor and genuine care created a supportive environment where I felt safe and confident in your expertise.

When the big day finally arrived, I felt a sense of calm and confidence knowing that you were by my side. Your expert guidance and encouragement during labor were instrumental in helping me navigate through the challenges and ultimately achieve a successful vaginal delivery. I will forever be grateful for your skillful hands and reassuring presence during one of the most pivotal moments of my life.

Thanks to your exceptional care, I welcomed a healthy baby into the world, and for that, I am eternally grateful. Your dedication to your profession and your patients is truly commendable, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have had you as my gynecologist.

Once again, thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you have done for me and my little one. Your impact on our lives will never be forgotten.

Delivery at 6 months is advised in certain cases where continuation of pregnancy is going to endager life of mother or baby.If mother & baby are in  good condition maximum effort is taken to prevent preterm delivery.

6 months fetus weighing 560 gms has a poor survival rate in the best of the centres.I don't think anyone would say 'be positive' in that context.

Many times we need to do certain tests( some are expensive& some are not expensive) to know the cause of  pregnancy problems ,so that if possible  problems can be prevented in subsequent pregnancy .
We offer the tests,but patients have the CHOICE to do.

Many  pts understand their problems  explained by the doctor & remain optimistic to do necessary  tests hoping for better outcome
Some patients fail to accept & understand & blame on others

I know it‚Äôs late, but better late than never! 

One of the people we as a family are grateful for is Dr.Shobha Venkat.
She was my gynecologist for both my babies.
I gave birth to my baby girl in 2018, who is going to be 5 years old in other 3 months. 
The journey throughout my pregnancy with my daughter was very smooth. I had no issues.

I gave birth to my son in Sep 2022, but it was very difficult, I had many health issues. 

There were times I was really stressed, worried and sometimes I used to think if I could deliver the baby safe.
But the moment I enter into her cabin and see her big smile, all my worries would just fade away.

Any Issue I tell her, she had a solution for that. 
From the first visit, throughout the Pregnancy the care given by Dr. Shobha Venkat has been phenomenal. 
She is an amazing woman, a wonderful human being.

But she always gives the credits to me saying that I managed it very well üôÇ

Doctor, I hope this post reaches you.
You brightened up our lives with 2 beautiful children, We are a happy family now.

You really can't imagine the amount of respect we have for you. you've become one of the most important people in our lives.
Thank you! Thank you very much for all the care!

And I can't complete this post with out thanking your whole team of doctors nursers and the house keeping staff.
Especially Doctor Chethana for supporting in the delivery.
Nurse Sheebha, she took care of me during the labour
Nurse Anniyammal, She is a wonderful person, didn't hesitate even a bit to complete the procedures after the delivery.

People may say its your job, or responsibility whatever, but it means a lot for us.

"Doctor friendliness,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"We would like to thank Dr.Shobha for making our pregnancy journey calm and relaxed.
Initially we visited a different doctor on confirmation of pregnancy and they suggested supportive injections for entire first trimester and diet plans and weekly blood sugar tests,etc. It scared us at the beginning of the journey. Then we came to know about Dr.Shobha through our colleagues and we decided to visit her. As mentioned by so many others, mam always welcomes with warm smile and the first thing she mentioned to us was that Pregnancy is not a disease and we should enjoy the pregnancy. She reviewed the reports and assured they were not worrying. We felt that we were in good hands and relaxed. Mam always encouraged for normal delivery and we delivered our first baby vaginally under Dr.Shobha's supervision.

With this positive experience, we decided we would visit only Dr. Shobha in our successive pregnancy and we did so. In our second pregnancy, my blood sugar levels were borderline high but mam handled it in a very calm way and suggested to do portion control and continue the same diet instead of suggesting a completely different diet which makes it difficult to follow.  Also, mam always encourages to eat healthy food, example my iron levels were a little low and she suggested to supplement it in diet instead of resorting to iron injections immediately. Mam never suggested unnecessary tests/medicines. She encouraged us for normal delivery this time also and under her guidance, we were able to deliver our second baby also vaginally.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I am writing this on mother's day, as this mother's day is special for me as being mother of a month old boy and all thanks to Dr. Shobha.
 We started our family planning in late 2017. I conceived in Dec 2017 but after 10 weeks also we couldn't hear baby's heartbeat and I had to go through miscarriage. After that same thing happened in Oct 2018. After second miscarriage in a year I was mentally broken. Becouse of 2 miscarriages Dr. shobha asked us to do some special reports. All reports were normal. Then doctor advice me reduce some weight and be happy and be mentally prepare before trying for 3rd time. I followed same. Waited for 6-7 months and during that time I excercised a lot and focused on healthy diet. After that we tried for 3rd time and everything worked out well and we blessed with baby boy in April.
What I like about Dr is she always welcomes patients with smile and say how my girl is doing. This gives positivity and strength to patients. Atleast for the people likeme who are staying away from family and gone through miscarriages in past. 
She was always reachable through call/what's app/sms for my any queries related health and later when lockdown got imposed due to corona virus. 
I had normal delivery, that to all thanks to Dr Shobha and her staff from cloud 9 hospital. I had given up and told her staff and her many times that I can't bear pain and please do c-section. But they always told me you can do it we all are with you. 
Some other doctors might have gone for C-section as soon as patient asks for it. But She was firm on her decision that till things are fine and she will not do C-section and she kept motivating me. 
She used to tell me make your mind and be strong, you will sail through your entire pregnancy journey and labour time easily. This is very important now a days as we all know that now C-section is not as painfull as it used to be before and we start giving up easily.

I consulted Dr. Shobha for my first pregnancy in June 2020. What I like most about Dr. Shobha is that she is easy to talk to, listens attentively, advises appropriately and focuses on overall well-being. 
Due to Covid restrictions, I had to sometimes consult her online which was also smooth and equally effective.

During the second trimester, I started feeling severe itching in my palms and feet. After consultation and blood tests, I was diagnosed with a liver condition - Cholestasis of pregnancy. I looked for it online and was disheartened at the severity of the disease and its side-effects such as preterm delivery, still-birth, slow baby growth etc., but doctor Shobha calmed us down and explained the condition well to us. She prescribed the necessary medication and also advised Liver Function Test every 15 days to keep track of the progress, this gave us more confidence and helped reduce our anxiety. 

Doctor Shobha's cool attitude, timely advice and detailed explanations at all stages of pregnancy lead to a healthy baby delivery at 39 weeks.

She did not mandate the medications and focused on natural diet. She regularly monitored the health checkup reports and ensured everything is normal. I really liked her ever smiling attitude. In my case I did not get the labour pain until the due date, so we decided to induce labour pain. We waited for 15 hours and she tried several techniques and finally I was able to deliver normally. The pain was unbearable but the doctor and staff kept motivating me for normal delivery. 
I also asked about epidural and its side effects and decided to opt for that. Many people think its same as anaesthesia but actually its analgesia and I did not face any side effects post pregnancy. It really helps in easing the labour pain of normal delivery.

We are very glad to have shared this experience with Dr. Shobha. Right from the start she was welcoming, warm,  firm and guided us with advice to make my pregnancy comfortable.  She made sure we didn't have to do multiple tests and follow-up visits and guided us with only what was required.
My husband and I were very particular about having a natural delivery and because of the positive experience of our journey, we were absolutely certain that was how it was going to be for us.  While I attended Lamaze classes, discussed a birth plan and my expectations, and was moderately active throughout, I was very humbled to learn that you can need to be prepared for any scenario as I ended up having a c-section during an early water leak with no dilation. This could have been a very negative experience due to the disappointment of not having my plan A scenario, which is why I am grateful for Dr. Shobha who helped ease my mind and talked me through the importance of a C-sec given the situation if it was not for her I would have been in a state of panic. It made me realize it is so important to have your baby delivered by a doctor who understands what's important for you and can provide you with the best advice and take decisions that might be overwhelming for you to take on your own.
She has incredible experience in her field and I would recommend her to be part of your journey for sure.

Sorry about your feelings!
Clarifying the doubts of my patients & students is my priority in my clinical practice & that is what brings me joy& we @ Bharggavi clinic do it religiously
Most clients appreciate & some do not .We do understand that each ones expectations are at different levels,& can't meet everyone's specially if it is unrealistic
Take care & Best wishes
