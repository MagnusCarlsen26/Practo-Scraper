My wife then complained how come they made her assistant sit under main doctorâ€™s name without patientâ€™s knowledge? The supporting staff apologised and while appreciating our politeness they told other patients behaved rudely when they got to know about that. This is a serious matter when it comes to trust.

,,0,0,NO,"Pathetic experience. I went there for a small medical issue, the doctor is okay but the management is pathetic and slow. 

1. Not asking test consent - First the doctor wrote some tests post visitation,then the clinic people directly sent me to the lab room without even asking whether I want to do the tests from the same clinic.
2. Not experienced assistant - The lab technician *** **** ** ***** *** *** **** ******* *** ****** ****** ** kept on moving the needle around my vien to get the blood. When I asked that person whether he is experienced for the job then he said he is from ott and not a lab technician adding to that he took blood on two vials for 3 tests. When I highlighted the same to the receptionist she said not to worry and they will send the reports within 2-3 days. Continued misery
3. Delays and lies - They shared 2 out of 3 test reports and after multiple follow-ups over call/email/whatsapp over a period 8 days they told the 3rd report is not done and advised me to visit the clinic and then they will again do the test.

PATHETIC MANAGEMENT - **** * ******** ALSO THEY DO NOT RESPOND. I AM NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN.

Note - 
1. the follow-up consultation is only free if you visit within 4 days post your 1st consultation.
2. Tests are much cheaper outside the clinic
