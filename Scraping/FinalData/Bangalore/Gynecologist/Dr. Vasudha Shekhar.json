For the first time I walked into her clinic frankly with least expectation but i felt most comfortable throughout the 9 months of pregnancy and delivery and today finally I'm utmost satisfied. She has that magic of healing with smile and creating comfortable atmosphere. I have a kind of phobia with doctors, hospitals, injections etc. But I opted for C section and I had  confidence that she can handle it smoothly and she did it as I expected. Toady I no longer have that phobia. Thank u doctor for everything. ",

I have a kind of phobia with doctors, hospitals, injections etc. But I opted for C section and I had  confidence that she can handle it smoothly and she did it as I expected.
