Awesome doctor! Has helped me so much with everything I have been through! Really efficient.

Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It’s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient.

Dr. Smriti is indeed, the most treasured of the Doctors I have been privileged to meet.

It’s not only the good skills she has as a doctor but also the good heart, one that cares for others.

Her care really made me feel that I am in safe hands throughout my pregnancy.

Her personal touch and willingness to spend time with her patients explaining the situation is a welcome trait.

I feel most fortunate to have her as my gynaecologist.

She is kind of a person who tells you what is going on in regular language and not in ""doctor talk"".

Dr Smriti is genuinely blessed with the magical power to treat a life.

She made my journey of pregnancy stress free and a relaxed one.

Dr. Smriti’s presence holds positive vibes that is more powerful than any medicines.

Thank you doctor for the wonderful birthing experience, no words are enough to appreciate the service you do.

Your talent and caring manner is a credit to the medical profession.

We will continue to recommend you to all the couples who are planning for a baby.

We will keep you in Our prayers",2021-03-06 14:56:06,False,True,Arathi,,,

I had read this sloka in books and heard many times from different people. But today, I experienced it.
To us, you’re a magician, a great doctor, a special gift from God. 

We took treatment for around 7 years in Belgaum, Hubli, Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli and met many doctors but it was not successful.
As a last try we met Dr.Sunil Eshwar sir and Dr Smrithi mam and in the first consultation felt postiveness, comfortness and confidence that we are in safe hands.

You proved that ""Nothing is Impossible"". Despite of having multiple complexities in pregnency, your expertiseness, proffessionalism and the way you handled our case made it Possible We are blessed with a healthy Baby boy.
You’ve given us a new life. Thank you for your excellent treatment and also grateful for your friendly staff members.
