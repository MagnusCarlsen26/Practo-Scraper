She immediately put me at ease and instilled confidence that I was in safe hands. My delivery was in the early morning hours, and I was impressed to see that Dr. Sreeja was there with me even during off-hours alongside her team, ensuring that every aspect of the delivery went smoothly.\n\nShe never recommended any unnecessary tests, scans, or medications. Additionally, she was open to considering our opinions and preferences, which made the entire process more comfortable and personalized.\n\nBased on my personal experience, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Sreeja Rani to anyone in need of a skilled and compassionate gynecologist. \n\nThank you, Dr. Sreeja, for your exceptional care and for making my delivery experience a positive and memorable one.",

She immediately put me at ease and instilled confidence that I was in safe hands. My delivery was in the early morning hours, and I was impressed to see that Dr. Sreeja was there with me even during off-hours alongside her team, ensuring that every aspect of the delivery went smoothly.\n\nShe never recommended any unnecessary tests, scans, or medications. Additionally, she was open to considering our opinions and preferences, which made the entire process more comfortable and personalized.\n\nBased on my personal experience, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Sreeja Rani to anyone in need of a skilled and compassionate gynecologist. \n\nThank you, Dr. Sreeja, for your exceptional care and for making my delivery experience a positive and memorable one.",

I am okay with that as the bigger the net chances are more to catch the fish(root cause) . But even after these tests reports, the doctor couldn't give me a proper root cause, just answered may be because of stress, can you believe it. And also I observed, doctor is not interested at all to go deep into the matter. When my wife asks for another problem, the doctor without examination only, concluded not issue (how is that possible, I wonder). I have the complete story, as we had very good experience with her first appointment when she was in Narayana hospital, so we thought of consulting with her again (now she is in manipal). With current experience, definitely I wouldn't refer anyone to her. Now I have to look for someone better.",
