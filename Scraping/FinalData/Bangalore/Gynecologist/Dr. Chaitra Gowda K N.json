She was very calm and guided us with right life style change and  supplement for readiness. This helped us in healthy conception. In 1st trimester we found that we had beta thalassamia intermedia thus my hb was down to 7 in second trimester, for which the doctor took right precautions throughout to ensure that baby is delivered full term with good development. Ours was even complicated case because of fibroid, but doctor kept us assured of phealthy  delivery and rooting out any fear from our minds. She was patient in all  consultation and ready to resolve any confusion.  she was readily available on call, message. Even when i had family emergency and was out of station for 2 months, we could continue consulting over video call, whatsapp. My family and i completely trusted the doctor and satisfied with her help thus highly recommend her.  Also, i had recommended 1 of my friend to consult her who conceived after long time and is continuing with healthy pregnancy under Dr. Chaitra's guidance. ",

Initially I was quite nervous but Dr Chaitra Gowda assured us that even in such a case normal delivery is possible.\nAnd true to her words I delivered my baby girl via normal vaginal delivery on 14th April. During my labour process, Ma'am was like a pillar of strength by my side , continuously motivating and supporting me during my painful contractions. \nI can't thank Dr Gowda enough for making this\u00a0 pregnancy journey so smooth and memorable for me.",

From the very first visit, I felt comfortable and reassured that I was in good hands. She is highly knowledgeable, professional, and caring.Dr. Chaitra takes her time during appointments to listen to any concerns or questions and provides thorough explanations and guidance. She is always available at the hospital and has only 15-20min waiting time. She is also available over WhatsApp for any queries. She has a calm and reassuring demeanor that helps to ease any anxiety that may arise during pregnancy.During my labor experience, I had a very tense moment when there were two loops around my baby's neck and my water index suddenly reduced to 8.7, putting my baby's and my life at risk. Dr. Chaitra suggested early admission for normal delivery, and I was hesitant at first, but I put my faith in her.When I consulted other senior doctors, they all suggested that the chances of normal delivery were very low, which made me even more anxious. However, Dr. Chaitra remained calm and confident, and I trusted her completely.Finally, the day arrived, and the delivery was painless and perfect. Dr. Chaitra's expertise and care had resulted in a successful virginal delivery, despite the challenges we faced earlier. I was immensely grateful to her for her support and guidance throughout the pregnancy and delivery.Overall, Dr. Chaitra's dedication to her profession and her patients is unparalleled, and I would highly recommend her to anyone in need of obstetric care.",

She is very patient and polite who will listen to all your problems be it day Or night. She is available on phone and never misses to reply to ur texts. I had been consulting her from Davangere almost for 7 months in my pregnancy.. Most of the time texted her or called her randomly and she had responded without any delay. 2. You can get any sort of clarification. She would make sure we are comfortable on discussing the same. I had a miscarriage before this delivery and she made sure that I don't have any doubts on anything and making sure to not to panic or get any kind of fear on the same. Her constant support and confidence kept me out of fear. 3. Her guidance and advice in pregnancy helped me  to deliver a healthy baby boy. She gives all inputs of do's and dont's. U can ask her the most silliest doubts without any hesitation and she will reply to you without getting irritated. She was always sweet and so kind to me which was very crucial during my pregnancy who  patiently listened to all my issues and gave appropriate solutions. Especially after a miscarriage ur mind would doubt even a slightest change in your body. And I was constantly checking with her and she always responded with a smile. I am so grateful to Dr Chaitra for all the support I received . I would highly recommend her to everyone. Thank you Dr once again for everything \u2764",

She made me deliver normally even though i was really scared of it. She had more confidence in me than i had.",

Her vibrant smile and ever friendly    communication and explanation of all procedures and consultations were always a pleasant experience for me.\nI personally believe beyond the medical expertise a doctor has, the confidence , calmness , patience and care with which a doctor handles a patient makes all the difference, Chaitra maam was a true testimony to the above. \nThe whole thought of strict doctors and scary hospital environment was all put to rest when I was under maam s  supervision.  Right from a PV examination to post delivery stitch removal, Chaitra ma\u2019am\u2019s consultation had a magical touch. Overall I had a completely seamless and least painful delivery experience and my family and I are ever thankful to maam for the guidance and care. ",

This really shows the commitment and selfless service she is doing towards her patients!\n\nI would 100% recommend Doctor Gowda to anyone who is searching for doctors during their pregnancy journey.\n\nThanks a lot once again \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

She was very calm and guided us with right life style change and  supplement for readiness. This helped us in healthy conception. In 1st trimester we found that we had beta thalassamia intermedia thus my hb was down to 7 in second trimester, for which the doctor took right precautions throughout to ensure that baby is delivered full term with good development. Ours was even complicated case because of fibroid, but doctor kept us assured of phealthy  delivery and rooting out any fear from our minds. She was patient in all  consultation and ready to resolve any confusion.  she was readily available on call, message. Even when i had family emergency and was out of station for 2 months, we could continue consulting over video call, whatsapp. My family and i completely trusted the doctor and satisfied with her help thus highly recommend her.  Also, i had recommended 1 of my friend to consult her who conceived after long time and is continuing with healthy pregnancy under Dr. Chaitra's guidance. ",

Initially I was quite nervous but Dr Chaitra Gowda assured us that even in such a case normal delivery is possible.\nAnd true to her words I delivered my baby girl via normal vaginal delivery on 14th April. During my labour process, Ma'am was like a pillar of strength by my side , continuously motivating and supporting me during my painful contractions. \nI can't thank Dr Gowda enough for making this\u00a0 pregnancy journey so smooth and memorable for me.",

From the very first visit, I felt comfortable and reassured that I was in good hands. She is highly knowledgeable, professional, and caring.Dr. Chaitra takes her time during appointments to listen to any concerns or questions and provides thorough explanations and guidance. She is always available at the hospital and has only 15-20min waiting time. She is also available over WhatsApp for any queries. She has a calm and reassuring demeanor that helps to ease any anxiety that may arise during pregnancy.During my labor experience, I had a very tense moment when there were two loops around my baby's neck and my water index suddenly reduced to 8.7, putting my baby's and my life at risk. Dr. Chaitra suggested early admission for normal delivery, and I was hesitant at first, but I put my faith in her.When I consulted other senior doctors, they all suggested that the chances of normal delivery were very low, which made me even more anxious. However, Dr. Chaitra remained calm and confident, and I trusted her completely.Finally, the day arrived, and the delivery was painless and perfect. Dr. Chaitra's expertise and care had resulted in a successful virginal delivery, despite the challenges we faced earlier. I was immensely grateful to her for her support and guidance throughout the pregnancy and delivery.Overall, Dr. Chaitra's dedication to her profession and her patients is unparalleled, and I would highly recommend her to anyone in need of obstetric care.",

She is very patient and polite who will listen to all your problems be it day Or night. She is available on phone and never misses to reply to ur texts. I had been consulting her from Davangere almost for 7 months in my pregnancy.. Most of the time texted her or called her randomly and she had responded without any delay. 2. You can get any sort of clarification. She would make sure we are comfortable on discussing the same. I had a miscarriage before this delivery and she made sure that I don't have any doubts on anything and making sure to not to panic or get any kind of fear on the same. Her constant support and confidence kept me out of fear. 3. Her guidance and advice in pregnancy helped me  to deliver a healthy baby boy. She gives all inputs of do's and dont's. U can ask her the most silliest doubts without any hesitation and she will reply to you without getting irritated. She was always sweet and so kind to me which was very crucial during my pregnancy who  patiently listened to all my issues and gave appropriate solutions. Especially after a miscarriage ur mind would doubt even a slightest change in your body. And I was constantly checking with her and she always responded with a smile. I am so grateful to Dr Chaitra for all the support I received . I would highly recommend her to everyone. Thank you Dr once again for everything \u2764",

Her vibrant smile and ever friendly    communication and explanation of all procedures and consultations were always a pleasant experience for me.\nI personally believe beyond the medical expertise a doctor has, the confidence , calmness , patience and care with which a doctor handles a patient makes all the difference, Chaitra maam was a true testimony to the above. \nThe whole thought of strict doctors and scary hospital environment was all put to rest when I was under maam s  supervision.  Right from a PV examination to post delivery stitch removal, Chaitra ma\u2019am\u2019s consultation had a magical touch. Overall I had a completely seamless and least painful delivery experience and my family and I are ever thankful to maam for the guidance and care. ",

This really shows the commitment and selfless service she is doing towards her patients!\n\nI would 100% recommend Doctor Gowda to anyone who is searching for doctors during their pregnancy journey.\n\nThanks a lot once again \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

I know for sure today i have a baby only cause of Dr Chaitra. From the moment i conceived again possible only due to doctor and her treatment and encouragment. I had a hemorage a week afte knowing i conceived and Dr was very clear about the siutation and explained it to me very well no fear mongering neither did she sugar coat it but in a calm manner which in turn gave me the encouragemnt to face it. Advicing me on what to do and promptly giving me medical care .As the pregnancy progressed Dr was on mark with all checks and vaccinations and fetal monitoring. Coaching me to do the best and encourging me when i got dishartened .\nBoth Dr and us had planned for a normal delivery( starting me on squats and kegel exercise at the begenning of my thrist trimester) but by the end of my final trimest my BP started to shoot up and due to less fetal movement we had to rush in for a emergency C-Section. This was within 1-2 hrs and Dr was immediatly available and present . After the delivery and based on what happend in the OT ( and  lot of googling later ) I am 1000% sure that C-Section was the only solution and I am really glad i put blind fait in my Dr who has never advice anything wrong for me.\nDr Chaitra was the only doctor ( even pediatrics did not help) who asked how my son and liteally showed me what i was doing wrong with breastfeeding and how to latch properly. This is above and beyond what was expected and this shows how much the doctor cares about her patients .Since the others just told me to watch youtube videos.\nI can never thank Dr Chaitra enough for all the suppport she has given me .\n",

The way she supported me in OT it was like a family member.I would recommend everyone pl visit her once if you have any gynae related issue or planning for pregnancy and  pregnancy journey. SHE IS AN ANGEL AND LUCKY CHARM TO ME..seeing her half of my problem get solved. Really dont have any word to explain what a fantastic doctor she is..",

One of the most amazing things about her is she replies to your messages, even when it is a silly one..\nEven post delivery she counselled me on several things very nicely. Overall I feel for a Doctor it is very important to keep the patient calm in every situation and tackle the situation objectively. Doctor Chaitra is very good at this and I shall be forever greatful to her for being with me and my husband in this journey.",

During my 3rd trimester, there was a possibility of me having pre term delivery due to false contractions (during the 29th week). I was admitted for close to a week to bring down the contractions and Doctor was  fully involved from the beginning till the end, even ensuring to visit me during odd hours and give all the encouragement and support , besides the timely and required medications for ensuring baby growth and reaching full term.

Her friendly nature made me super comfortable to interact and discuss all my problems.  Though I had multiple issues health wise,  her treatment made my pregnancy smoother. \n\nThank you so much  \"Chaitra Gowda\" for all your contribution and efforts that you do to keep your patients  well. I really admire all your dedication to your work.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Chaitra Gowda .",

I had literally called her directly that not able to tolerate the labour pain, she has been very kind to speak on call, shared positive vibes holding hands. Only with Dr. Chaitra Gowda support and encouragement I delivered my baby vaginally. I would definitely suggest Dr. Chaitra Gowda for my colleagues and relatives.

This gave me the sense of satisfaction that I am always under medical surveillance. \nLastly, this may sound little cheesy but to be honest my family and me are in love with your professionalism and the amount of personal care-love you gave me.

For me there was chance of pre term delivery due to less fluid and baby position in 7th month but she managed to postponed the time and I completed all nine months. During delivery also we faced some complications but she managed everything and did my normal delivery. Post delivery also she took complete care of me my baby. Also the recovery post delivery was very smooth and I was able to enjoy my precious time with my bundle of joy due to Dr. Chaitra Gowda. I strongly recommend for Dr. Chaitra Gowda for all gynecologist related issue and specially for pregnancy and delivery. Thanks to Dr. Chaitra Gowda for giving me joy of motherhood.",

She was a godsend to resolve my wife's complication post delivery and herself put in lot of effort to stop the pain.\n\nShe has a personal touch with her patients and we are glad that we chose her for our care. I would recommend her to all my friends and family in case if they need treatment related to her specialization.",

At one point of time, I trusted her and began to adhere only to her instructions. I didn't get pain naturally. So, we planned for IOL. Contractions began and I was in intolerable pain for several hours. I felt a bit relieved only upon seeing her in labour ward.  She was motivating me even in labour ward which gave me confidence that I was in safe hands. I would strongly recommend her for pregnancy and related issues too.",

She is having an excellent way of approach which is rarely found in other Doctors because prior consulting her I had visited many doctors of same domain in Bangalore. More than a doctor she was like my elder sister and I can still remember her timely follow ups about me during my labour days even at night 1 AM, 3 AM, 4 AM. She is the reason for my normal delivery I can say, because she is having an Angel hand always filled with positive vibes for you. I strongly recommend her to those ladies who are expecting moreover want to have a normal delivery,\ud83e\udd70\n",
