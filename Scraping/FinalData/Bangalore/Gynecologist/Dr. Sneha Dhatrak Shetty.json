                "review_text": "She drove us to our destiny and we are thankful to her :)\n\nDr Sneha Dhatrak is a wonderful doctor and we highly recommend her as the gynecologist and obstrecian for all.\n\nGirisha is our first baby and like every couple having their first baby, we were equally anxious about the pregnancy process, about our doctor and the support we will receive.\n\nIn our first session itself, we realized the doctor is an amazing counselor and gave us practical and handy guidelines for each month of pregnancy. In our every session, beyond prescription and tests, she patiently explained about the pregnancy period, how to avoid misleading information ( as abundantly available on internet) and how to take care of self during the nine months.\n\nShe spent enough time with us on every session, patiently answering our questions (even if they were silly ) and remembering to follow-up on her suggestions/advise ( like have you now started drinking more water, more fruits?). We appreciated that our sessions were never rushed through and we came out of the clinic room satisfied and having no questions in mind.\n\nShe also took every little observation of ours seriously and never ever admonished them as silly. We felt respected as parents for that.\nThis is very crucial for the first time parents as they can be paranoid :)\n\nShe balances with ease, when the need arises to be assertive or when the need arises to be caring or when need arises to counsel or advise. Kudos to her for that.\n\nDuring the last nine months we had ups and downs and her mere presence at the hospital was definitely uplifting and strengthening. There was a certain complication regarding baby's health at one time for us at the hospital and we were really tensed and worried. The moment my wife saw her, it was a drastic change in our moods.  We felt that our baby was safe, under her care. That we felt is a mandatory requirement in a doctor and she excels at that.\n\nWe are extremely grateful for this kind hearted, patient, vibrant and highly knowledgeable doctor, who also striked a chord with us. \n\nShe was indeed like the driver, who made our journey to our destiny smooth, safe and this first time pregnancy pleasurable and we will ever be grateful to her for that. She indeed drove us to our destiny and what an amazing journey it was.\n\nIf our daughter grows up to be like her, we will indeed be very very proud parents.\n",

The staff were super speedy and didn't make me wait at any point. She spent as much time as needed to answer all my questions, educated me on the process to the very detail that I'm made 100% aware of what I'm dealing with. You can tell she truly cares about her patients. It gives me immense relief that I've done my part by choosing to freeze my eggs  at Vriksh by Dr Sneha.\n\nI undoubtedly recommend Vriksh to anyone seeking solutions to better fertility health and do so in a personalized way.",

Her command over the skill she pursued and the way she makes her patients confident about the treatment and end results are unmatchable. Their were scenarios we had doubts about ourselves but the way she addressed with technical aspects and clear communication restored our faith. Also, I have to mention that she comes to her to clinic on time and attends to her patients with care.  We have stepped into path of achieving our dreams and I would  proudly say that it is possible only because of Sneha mam with her help & care towards it.\nI truly recommend her to pursue your dreams in this area.

In the process, luckily I caught up one video in facebook where Dr Sneha Shetty was explaining about infertility related things and I was so impressed about it. We booked our appointment in the next day at Suchitra hegde hospital with Dr Sneha, we extremely felt happy the way she received us with a beutiful smile. She explained the problem very well and given some medications and suggestions for PCOD, then some medications for fertility..we followed her exactly whatever she adviced...In the first cycle itself my wife conceived naturally , now she is in second month..We are extremely very very happy with Dr Sneha Shetty madam treatment and I would straight away recommend you for the infertility treatment. The  hospital at Suchitra follows all covid protocols strictly and staff also very caring and guide us in a proper way. Final thanks to hegde fertility and Dr Sneha mam.",
