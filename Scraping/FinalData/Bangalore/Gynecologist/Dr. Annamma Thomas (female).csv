"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I am not a person who writes reviews. However I had no choice but to find the time and make an effort  to publicly acclaim the Angel in  SAINT Dr Annamma.  I had to wait an hour to see her. But I had no choice for there were other patients who had tokens before me, and come from various parts of the country.  Others waited as well. However every patient who came out of her chamber after the consultation, seemed to be radiating with satisfaction, joy and blessed. No one thought their wait was in vain.  While waiting I spoke to others who were waiting and asked  them why they were coming here inspite of the wait. The unanimous answer was that this doctor is more sympathetic and understanding than any other person or doctor. Several patients had come for second opinion including myself. Dr Annamma was very upfront and clearly indicated that her choice of delivery will always be a normal delivery. After my consultations I never minded the wait as I had found an Angel, whose tender loving hands mixed with love and sympathy, I had never seen  or experienced before.  For me, my family and friends there cannot be another doctor for Obstetrics and Gynaecology.  Thank You Maam.",2023-03-26 16:48:18,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
