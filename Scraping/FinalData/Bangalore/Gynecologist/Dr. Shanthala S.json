It is just progesterone drug used in your case for regularising cycle..and folic acid vitamin also  helps your ovary to function better.whether you recommend me or not is your choice.",

I am very much disappointed with this gesture. I was very happy with all other tests conducted at Sagar Hospitals.  But because of this unexplained behavior from Doctor, i would not be recommending anyone to Sagar Hospitals. Its the reputation of Hospital at stake. I sincerely hope Sagar Hospital would look into this case and take corrective and preventive measures, so that these things doesn't repeat. Regards, Shilpa",

She is friendly, caring, supportive and very kind. \nShe gives plenty of time to explain things very clearly and never rush. She was always been frank in her approach that gave me so much confidence. She made sure that I will have the best possible pregnancy and also most safe experience especially during this covid-19 pandemic time. \n\nShe handled the whole delivery so well and even post pregnancy care was well managed. I would highly recommend this doctor as a must visit doctor for your pregnancy. \n\nThank you so much doctor and we have a lovely Prince because of you. I am really thankful and grateful for your service.",

She is friendly, caring, supportive and very kind. \nShe gives plenty of time to explain things very clearly and never rush. She was always been frank in her approach that gave me so much confidence. She made sure that I will have the best possible pregnancy and also most safe experience especially during this covid-19 pandemic time. \n\nShe handled the whole delivery so well and even post pregnancy care was well managed. I would highly recommend this doctor as a must visit doctor for your pregnancy. \n\nThank you so much doctor and we have a lovely Prince because of you. I am really thankful and grateful for your service.",
