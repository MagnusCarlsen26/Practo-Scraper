She was easily approachable and I was able to contact her anytime through messages especially during lockdown period.\nThe best thing was she reduced my medicines dosage and in a month, YES my thyroid and glucose level fell into normal range. Also she prescribed only necessary tests.\n\nClinic was neat, COVID protocol was always followed and No much waiting time. Consultation fee and medicine rate was also reasonable.\nA big thumbs up and I would definitely recommend Dr.Vidya. Thank you Doctor for being friendly and supportive in all these 7 months.",

As much as we find internet to be the best source for all the information regarding PCOS, we always seek certain kind of personalised advice from a doctor. The doctors I have been to would prescribe medicines to correct irregular periods and would tell me to lose weight. These were the standard instructions I got from most of the doctors. But, to lose weight systematically, keeping in mind of the condition that I suffer from was very important. Dr. Vidya explained every bit of what PCOS is and how to go about with it. She was kind enough to make a diet plan and advised to go the natural way instead of taking hormonal pills or any of that kind. I would definitely recommend her to anyone I know who is going through gynecological problems. I was really impressed by her personalised way of treating patients and the attention she gives to you as a doctor. She is friendly and unlike the other doctors I've met, she is a good listener. As a patient, I've found a good doctor after many years and I can clearly say that I am satisfied with my experience. ",

She had complete knowledge and explained us patiently in detail of what\u2019s next. She was easily approachable and I was able to contact her anytime through messages especially during lockdown period.\nThe best thing was she reduced my medicines dosage and in a month, YES my thyroid and glucose level fell into normal range. Also she prescribed only necessary tests.\n\nClinic was neat, COVID protocol was always followed and No much waiting time. Consultation fee and medicine rate was also reasonable.\nA big thumbs up and I would definitely recommend Dr.Vidya. Thank you Doctor for being friendly and supportive in all these 7 months.",

As much as we find internet to be the best source for all the information regarding PCOS, we always seek certain kind of personalised advice from a doctor. The doctors I have been to would prescribe medicines to correct irregular periods and would tell me to lose weight. These were the standard instructions I got from most of the doctors. But, to lose weight systematically, keeping in mind of the condition that I suffer from was very important. Dr. Vidya explained every bit of what PCOS is and how to go about with it. She was kind enough to make a diet plan and advised to go the natural way instead of taking hormonal pills or any of that kind. I would definitely recommend her to anyone I know who is going through gynecological problems. I was really impressed by her personalised way of treating patients and the attention she gives to you as a doctor. She is friendly and unlike the other doctors I've met, she is a good listener. As a patient, I've found a good doctor after many years and I can clearly say that I am satisfied with my experience. ",

Your condition was such that you required a personal visit and ultrasounds which unfortunately cannot be given on teleconsultation , hence you were asked to visit a  specialist  personally as you were staying  abroad \n6. Blaming us saying we dont see reports , we have not even given u treatment or solution is totally wrong. We cannot simply put a patient on medicines without having the beef or tools for check ups . i heard u with lot of patience and very well remember what we spoke regarding your health \nWhat best could be offered in fifteen minutes and with in scope of teleconsultation has been given to u . \nUnfortunately ur issue is something which cannot be tackled online \nWish you good luck ",
