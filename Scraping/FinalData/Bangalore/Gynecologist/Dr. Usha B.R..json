Doctor\u00a0 gives enough\u00a0time to each patient, never rushes,\u00a0 hears out all the concerns and answers all our questions in a language that we can understand .\u00a0 I am a patient who reads about\u00a0 everything doctor says\u00a0 to get the confidence that the treatment is right for me.\u00a0 But when i met Dr Usha within 5 mins i knew i was in safe hands and i havent googled about my problem ever since. I underwent\u00a0laproscopic\u00a0left ovarian cyctectomy   \u00a0hysteroscopy guided endomaterial biopsy.

Thank you Doctor!\nFirst thing I noticed was that she has graduated from AIIMS. I blindly went ahead.\nDoctor\u2019s explanation/communication: Right from the beginning, there was a +ve vibe. She took the details and asked us if we were willing to go ahead. We said 'Yes'. She explained what and how the body transformations would happen until the next review and then subsequent reviews thereon. We asked every silly doubts and she was prompt enough to answer all. She even read my face once when I had one doubt and made me ask it. When my wife had complains about somethings, she gave the right suggestions. She encouraged us to attend knowledgeable sessions which really really helped us, whether it was yoga/meditation session, breast-feeding or physiotherapy.\n\nThings you liked about the doctor: There are many. Friendliness, Pleasant personality, Mentoring, Overall Support, Guidance, Care.\n\nAreas of improvement for Doctor: I am in no position to answer this. She is just great. Diet-Plan is something she can include. It's just a suggestion.\n\nI would refer her to anyone and everyone.",

The positive attitude is what we appreciate a much and even though during the whole course of my pregnancy v have faced several issues the only reason v were able to get a cute princess to our family is because of good treatment , positive attitude , supportive nature. Also we appreciate if she wasnt there getting normal delivery was also difficult lots of thanks to her and entire Apollo Team who was at labour . Have recommended her to some of my cousins and colleagues hopefully they also get a cute prince or princess to their family. Continue the good work ..... We are totally happy with the service. Thank You Deepika Santosh",

Thank you Doctor!\nFirst thing I noticed was that she has graduated from AIIMS. I blindly went ahead.\nDoctor\u2019s explanation/communication: Right from the beginning, there was a +ve vibe. She took the details and asked us if we were willing to go ahead. We said 'Yes'. She explained what and how the body transformations would happen until the next review and then subsequent reviews thereon. We asked every silly doubts and she was prompt enough to answer all. She even read my face once when I had one doubt and made me ask it. When my wife had complains about somethings, she gave the right suggestions. She encouraged us to attend knowledgeable sessions which really really helped us, whether it was yoga/meditation session, breast-feeding or physiotherapy.\n\nThings you liked about the doctor: There are many. Friendliness, Pleasant personality, Mentoring, Overall Support, Guidance, Care.\n\nAreas of improvement for Doctor: I am in no position to answer this. She is just great. Diet-Plan is something she can include. It's just a suggestion.\n\nI would refer her to anyone and everyone.",

Like they say rest is history, now we are blessed with a healthy boy baby. \n\nI remember the day of my delivery she was not in town but rushed from the airport directly to the delivery room, as soon as I saw her I was filled with delighted and confidence that everything will go smoothly from here and it did.",

The positive attitude is what we appreciate a much and even though during the whole course of my pregnancy v have faced several issues the only reason v were able to get a cute princess to our family is because of good treatment , positive attitude , supportive nature. Also we appreciate if she wasnt there getting normal delivery was also difficult lots of thanks to her and entire Apollo Team who was at labour . Have recommended her to some of my cousins and colleagues hopefully they also get a cute prince or princess to their family. Continue the good work ..... We are totally happy with the service.

She is always available on phone and if busy she even calls back. \n     Now i have delivered my kid and the c- sec was done by her(as we opted for it). In the OT also she was so smiling and comforting.  I have no post delivery complaints. My baby and me we both are doing fine. She is really a very good doctor in all aspects.",

She hardly spend 4 minutes with me. She expected me to know everything that's wrong with the organs. Might have been a hurry. I had to ask her which medicine is for what. She could've explained it properly knowing the patient could be stressed or might not understand it as not everyone is from a medical background. You charge 650 rupees for a patient, atleast spend 10 minutes. I'll be visiting another gynecologist now to get a second opinion. ",

My wife was down with lower abdomen pain for quite a few months. We contacted several doctors but their medication didn't work. At last Dr Usha identified the problem and accordingly medication started and it was cured. Apart from the above short explanation i would say Dr Usha puts an air of humaneness while treating. She responds to the call / messages, if not immediately then for sure later on. Although Doctors are many but a doctor on whom you can trust without any doubt are very few, and i would say Dr Usha is one of them. God bless her and her supporting staffs.",
