I had been looking for gynecologist for 1 year and with God's grace, I came across her and I have been consulting her since day 1 of my pregnancy.\nI had a very rough pregnancy journey, and I was going to lose my baby when I was 19 weeks pregnant. On 16/11/2023 I was taken to the hospital on emergency, I was 4 cm dilated and was almost going to miscarry. Dr Manju Deepthi took a huge risk of performing emergency cerclage where my cervix was stitched. However, post preforming the initial surgery my stiches had started giving up from one side, however she refused to give up as the membrane was still intact and she performed another surgery and restitched my cervix. I was hospitalized for 3 months and was on complete bed rest and on heavy medications. I was in such a critical state where my stitches could have given up at any point and as I was on complete bed rest my baby was not gaining weight and I used to breakdown every single time when the scanning was done, but Dr Manju Deepthi always consoled me, motivated me and sympathized my situation and did her best to save me and my baby. The entire Cloudine Hospital (HRBR) stayed by my side prayed for me and constantly motivated me.\nAs the pregnancy continued, due to baby weight, there was a risk that my cervix could tear and could have caused a huge damage hence I had to opt for the delivery. Dr Manju Deepthi tried her best so that I could deliver the baby normally however I was in a very weak condition due to which C-section was performed and I have successfully delivered my baby on 14th February 2024 (33 weeks 4 days) and baby was 1.9 kg. Dr Manju Deepthi also had made sure that the best pediatrician and NICU Team were available at the time of my delivery and I Thank the Pediatricians Dr Sujith, Dr Sandeep and Dr Prashanth for helping my baby survive.\nI don't have enough of words to describe how much grateful I am towards Dr Manju Deepthi and her Team, Hema Madam, Dr Supritha Rangaswamy, Dr Ayesha, Dr Nikitha, Dr Sahithi and all the nursing Team (Sister Balema, Deeksha, Sita, Monalisa, Anu, Sheeba and team) because of whom today my baby is doing wonderful. Thank you for all your support and prayers. And huge thank you to the Housekeeping Staff and Canteen Staff who has shown nothing but kindness towards me from day 1 and even post delivering the baby.\n\nI strongly recommend Dr Manju Deepthi to all the women who are looking for not only a best gynecologist but an expert who will not only consult but will walk throughout your pregnancy journey by your side. She is a great listener and very calm person who would give you only honest opinion on the given situation and guide you accordingly and this is the main reason for me to continue consulting her till date.\n\nThank You Cloudnine Hospital (HRBR) for having such a wonderful doctor onboard.\n\nThank You Dr Manju Deepthi. Will always be grateful to you.",

I have been suffering from PCOS since 7 years and no one had ever taken such good care of me like her, instead everyone has given me plethora of tests with no significance, but she has always been extremely kind and considerate. She has been helpful during every step and has guided me efficiently. I had complete absence of cycle and only because of her finally I am able to experience regular cycles after 7 years. This has created such a profound effect in my life and made it so peaceful. \n\nI am forever indebted to her for her compassion, care and such incredible treatment.",

Ma'am is a blessing in disguise for us\ud83d\ude07.. After miscarriage in first year of marriage we struggled to conceive again .We had consulted with few other gynes in town but none of it was fruitful we had lost our hope . Never did any of the Dr we consulted explained things to us they just merely treated us with loads of medicines and scans .They didn't understand our plight. It's was a mental and emotional toll for us.When we met Manju ma'am our lives changed\ud83c\udf08. The very first interaction with ma'am was positive , she filled us with ray of hope and the confidence ma'am assured us and helped us to be positive throughout our journey of pregnancy . Ma'am understood our case and acted immediately , never did ma'am treat us just as patient, we were treated like a family. After consulting ma'am her words and personal touch became our strength I was confident and the mental toll we had was eased..Even though mine was high risk pregnancy ma'am never passed any tension to us. . Ma'am was always available to answer our smallest and silliest of our queries in wee hours .. Ma'am always encouraged me to have a normal delivery  even with high risk pregnancy. It's because of ma'am we are blessed with parenthood . A special thanks to Dr Durga shekar ma'am \u2763\ufe0ffor always filling us with courage and supporting us throughout our journey of pregnancy.\nThe staff at Madilu are so welcoming and dawn a warm smile on their face which immediately comforts any one entering the place .\n\nI would \ud83d\udcaf% recommend Dr MANJU DEEPTI ma'am ( MADILU HOSPITAL ) . Best gynecologist in town who know what is apt for her patients and strives immediately to give the \u26a1best results at affordable price.\u26a1\n\nHappy to have found you Dr Manju ma'am \u2763\ufe0f.

I had been looking for gynecologist for 1 year and with God's grace, I came across her and I have been consulting her since day 1 of my pregnancy.\nI had a very rough pregnancy journey, and I was going to lose my baby when I was 19 weeks pregnant. On 16/11/2023 I was taken to the hospital on emergency, I was 4 cm dilated and was almost going to miscarry. Dr Manju Deepthi took a huge risk of performing emergency cerclage where my cervix was stitched. However, post preforming the initial surgery my stiches had started giving up from one side, however she refused to give up as the membrane was still intact and she performed another surgery and restitched my cervix. I was hospitalized for 3 months and was on complete bed rest and on heavy medications. I was in such a critical state where my stitches could have given up at any point and as I was on complete bed rest my baby was not gaining weight and I used to breakdown every single time when the scanning was done, but Dr Manju Deepthi always consoled me, motivated me and sympathized my situation and did her best to save me and my baby. The entire Cloudine Hospital (HRBR) stayed by my side prayed for me and constantly motivated me.\nAs the pregnancy continued, due to baby weight, there was a risk that my cervix could tear and could have caused a huge damage hence I had to opt for the delivery. Dr Manju Deepthi tried her best so that I could deliver the baby normally however I was in a very weak condition due to which C-section was performed and I have successfully delivered my baby on 14th February 2024 (33 weeks 4 days) and baby was 1.9 kg. Dr Manju Deepthi also had made sure that the best pediatrician and NICU Team were available at the time of my delivery and I Thank the Pediatricians Dr Sujith, Dr Sandeep and Dr Prashanth for helping my baby survive.\nI don't have enough of words to describe how much grateful I am towards Dr Manju Deepthi and her Team, Hema Madam, Dr Supritha Rangaswamy, Dr Ayesha, Dr Nikitha, Dr Sahithi and all the nursing Team (Sister Balema, Deeksha, Sita, Monalisa, Anu, Sheeba and team) because of whom today my baby is doing wonderful. Thank you for all your support and prayers. And huge thank you to the Housekeeping Staff and Canteen Staff who has shown nothing but kindness towards me from day 1 and even post delivering the baby.\n\nI strongly recommend Dr Manju Deepthi to all the women who are looking for not only a best gynecologist but an expert who will not only consult but will walk throughout your pregnancy journey by your side. She is a great listener and very calm person who would give you only honest opinion on the given situation and guide you accordingly and this is the main reason for me to continue consulting her till date.\n\nThank You Cloudnine Hospital (HRBR) for having such a wonderful doctor onboard.\n\nThank You Dr Manju Deepthi. Will always be grateful to you.",

Ma'am is a blessing in disguise for us\ud83d\ude07.. After miscarriage in first year of marriage we struggled to conceive again .We had consulted with few other gynes in town but none of it was fruitful we had lost our hope . Never did any of the Dr we consulted explained things to us they just merely treated us with loads of medicines and scans .They didn't understand our plight. It's was a mental and emotional toll for us.When we met Manju ma'am our lives changed\ud83c\udf08. The very first interaction with ma'am was positive , she filled us with ray of hope and the confidence ma'am assured us and helped us to be positive throughout our journey of pregnancy . Ma'am understood our case and acted immediately , never did ma'am treat us just as patient, we were treated like a family. After consulting ma'am her words and personal touch became our strength I was confident and the mental toll we had was eased..Even though mine was high risk pregnancy ma'am never passed any tension to us. . Ma'am was always available to answer our smallest and silliest of our queries in wee hours .. Ma'am always encouraged me to have a normal delivery  even with high risk pregnancy. It's because of ma'am we are blessed with parenthood . A special thanks to Dr Durga shekar ma'am \u2763\ufe0ffor always filling us with courage and supporting us throughout our journey of pregnancy.\nThe staff at Madilu are so welcoming and dawn a warm smile on their face which immediately comforts any one entering the place .\n\nI would \ud83d\udcaf% recommend Dr MANJU DEEPTI ma'am ( MADILU HOSPITAL ) . Best gynecologist in town who know what is apt for her patients and strives immediately to give the \u26a1best results at affordable price.\u26a1\n\nHappy to have found you Dr Manju ma'am \u2763\ufe0f.

We will never forget your support. She took care of my wife so well during her pregnancy journey which helped my wife to stay positive and deliver twin baby boys at 35 weeks. She explains each and everything in detail and does not hurry up treating patients. She gives enough time to each and every patient and clears all doubts.",

After one month study she gave me treatment for 1 month and i concieved. Now i delivered a healthy baby girl normally. The delivery was of so ease did not get to know the pain at all by her physiotherapy team. She stayed with us whole night and day. \nI have met so many busy doctors who give only 2 or 3 mins and they will simply write treatment and give medicimes and we have to follow but madam explains everything and she will allow us to take decision under her guidance. Whoever has visited madam will agree with me. My consultation with her lasted for 20 to 30 mins with throughout the clock availability. \nI wish mam all the success and good health to treat needy patients like me. ",
