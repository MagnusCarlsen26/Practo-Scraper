"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,","Irregular Periods,",0,0,NO,"A terrible excuse for a doctor, she gave us no diagnosis paper, but slapped a test on us right away. The doctor was in a hurry to see us out of her cabin, and the attendant was in a hurry to charge us a consultation fee. Did we understand what the doctor meant by her two minute prognosis on a cyst in the uterus of my daughter? NO. it is a doctor's job to explain precisely and clearly what the problem at hand might be, but this lady showed no such concern.

"Wait time,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,",0,0,YES,Overall it was okay..only thing I didn't like was when I mentioned Dr. Suhasini that it was my second opinion from her and I have already done the test..her behaviour totally changed and she got little irate.. after that she didn't even listened to me properly where I was trying to say her about the medicine which I am taking.. also since I didn't get appointment that day but could manage somehow..so in front of me itself she told that not to entertain any patients without the appointment..which I personally didn't like.. she did some examine just to increase the bill which I felt was unnecessary.. I am not sure whether I should visit her again.. if some one coming for a second opinion they should treat them properly.. I would recommend peeple to visit her but also assure them they can get such behaviour..,2021-06-28 07:39:53,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
