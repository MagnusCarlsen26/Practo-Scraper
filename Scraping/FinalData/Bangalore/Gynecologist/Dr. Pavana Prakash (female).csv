My first pregnancy was smooth due to her handholding at every stage. And it’s not over, her decision to make a normal delivery for me was unbelievable. Like every woman who is worried about- doctors recommending c section even if we are capable of having a normal delivery; this thought was on top of my mind. But trust me, even when my family and me asked for c section or asked to epidural procedure due to delivery pains, doctor denied and insisted for a normal delivery and she successfully made it even when there were 3 loops of chord around my son’s neck.. Hats off to you and your team Ma’am 😍 you will always be remembered for your work!! Wish you all the success in your life. May many many more people benefit from your service.

Dr. Pavan Prakash was my angel in disguise.

But she gave me hopes and kept me positive.

On the day of my labor, I felt like giving up on normal delivery and thought of going for c section. But she didn't let tat happen. 
She along with Dr. Smitha, motivated me to stay strong and give a try before deciding on c section...
N there it was, almost a Medical Miracle. NORMAL delivery with Fibroids and without Epidural... Really unbelievable..
But it wouldn't be possible without Dr. Pavan Prakash. Hats off to her patience and positivity. No words to express my gratitude...
My heart felt thanks to her.
