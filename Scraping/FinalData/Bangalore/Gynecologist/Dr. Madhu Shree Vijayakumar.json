She is the most approachable, humble, genuine *** ************* doctor I\u2019ve dealt with. She was extremely patient to answer every single query I had and also provided extensive emotional support during my pregnancy. \nHer skills are undoubtedly perfect, there was not even one instance where she faultered. \nShe was completely transparent about everything and yet at the same time completely put us at ease with her personality and attitude. Although my baby was IUGR and premature by a month, she had taken all the necessary precautions to ensure that my baby didn\u2019t have to be admitted to the NICU for even a single day. \nIn this day and age it\u2019s extremely rare to find doctors who push for a normal delivery. Even though I had to undergo csection due to medical conditions, her first preference was to try for a normal delivery. \nOne of the best memories of this pregnancy is my experience with Dr Madhushree.

Especially in a big city and at a commercial hospital. I was willing to go for c-sec so as to avoid the pain but she insisted on a normal delivery and helped me make the decision and smoothly go through with it. She is a blessing for any pregnant woman. The warmth and support she provides makes one really indebted to her. I went for delivery in motherhood sahakar nagar without an insurance only coz i did trust her to do the best for me and my child. I had researched a lot online before finalizing a doctor when i moved to bangalore 5 months pregnant but i did not find much data. It was only by chance that i went to see dr madhushree on the recommendation of a local parlour lady. I had a very happy experience that i wish to share with everyone looking for a reliable doctor.",

My wife was in consultation (For pregnancy care & delivery) with Dr. Madhushree VijayaKumar, *** ** *** ****** *** *** **** ******* ** **** **** *****\nSince, our case was slightly critical, the doctor treated this as a special case and provided utmost care and support to my wife throughout.

There are no unanswered questions, doubts, or confusion at the end of our appointment. \n\nShe is the nicest, most caring doctor we have ever met \u2013 she even takes time to answer our calls during an emergency/distress situation to advice my wife and was always approchable and available on the phone round the clock. \n\nThank you so much, Doctor(Madam) for being so professional, friendly, caring and patient with us throughout. We all three of us (including our baby) will be always thankfull to you for the exceptional care and support. \n\nThank you,\nVijay Kumar TP/Varalaxmi\n\n",

Especially in a big city and at a commercial hospital. I was willing to go for c-sec so as to avoid the pain but she insisted on a normal delivery and helped me make the decision and smoothly go through with it. She is a blessing for any pregnant woman. The warmth and support she provides makes one really indebted to her. I went for delivery in motherhood sahakar nagar without an insurance only coz i did trust her to do the best for me and my child. I had researched a lot online before finalizing a doctor when i moved to bangalore 5 months pregnant but i did not find much data. It was only by chance that i went to see dr madhushree on the recommendation of a local parlour lady. I had a very happy experience that i wish to share with everyone looking for a reliable doctor.",

Also, with so many women undergoing C sections (4 cases I have heard in my own circle in the last 60 days) for various reasons, it's all the more important to have faith that your doctor will try her best to ensure a safe and a normal delivery.
