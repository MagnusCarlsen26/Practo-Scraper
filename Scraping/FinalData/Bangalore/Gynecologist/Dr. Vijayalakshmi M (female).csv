My 1st experince was just ok when i went there for PCOS treatment. 1st thing she said after asking my age was - ""You'are 29 and you're still not planning baby, then when will u?"" & her tone was not a concerned tone, she was extremely rude. Anyway, she suggested treatment & i was fine. 

The 2nd time i visited her was due to UTI. *** **** *** ****** ****** ******* *** ******** ********* ** **** she would just ask - "" So your periods came is it?
