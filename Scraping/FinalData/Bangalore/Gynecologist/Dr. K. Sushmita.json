                "review_text": "Well, I'm writing this after a prolonged duration... My baby is 11months old as date... I have been so pleased and fortunate to have had Dr. Sushmita as my gyno... Our 1st baby, and to ensure or start on with our very important decision of our life, we did think of going for a consultation... The day we walked in to Motherhood Hospital, Sahakarnagar we were sent to see Dr. Sushmita... Did not know much about her, and during our wait period we did try to do a quick check on google to gather a little info about the doctor... Finally it was our turn to meet her, I was already a little worried and tensed and much more thought running in me, since it was the 1st time I'm right in front of my gyno to discuss with her that we have decided to plan for a baby... We seeked a prior consultation since I was under birth control tablets/pills, so opting a pre-consultation before conception is what me and my husband thought as important or ideal... To commence our pre-consultation, she did recommend a few tests to be thru... During these course I found her very very humble, polite and very friendly...she made us feel more like a family... Post my pre-consultation, within a duration or a month we were back again, and this time since my pregnancy test kit showed me the result as positive... And from then no looking back... Was meeting Dr. Sushmita very often during my check up and during the course, our bond gradually increased and it felt more great meeting her and knowing all about baby... She addresses to all your concerns with a smile on her face, I have time and again bothered her with more and more doubts, some valid ones and some not... nevertheless she did not hesitate to answer them all... She will share her contact number and incase of any concerns she's available on phone or msgs... And she motivates you to deliver normally, that's a plus point in her. And I'm so grateful to have had her during this beautiful journey of motherhood... I delivered a baby boy on 15th Nov 2017, normal delivery... If your seeing her and seeking her advise, I bet your in very safe and expertise hands.",

From day one she is very friendly and always with a smile explained the solution to my concerns. That is when I decided to continue with the doctor during my pregnancy also. In my pregnancy I had few complications as I was obese and in 27th week was diagnosed with gestational diabeties. As this was my first pregnancy I used to get tensed soon and also I had lot of questions to ask. Doctor used to listen to my queries and answer to it without any fustration. Also in every visit she used to share her personal experience, give me tips to handle stress and calm myself . Doctor was anytime available on call. Sometimes I used to call doctor at 11 pm in night with NST reports she was anytime available on call.  When nearing my delivery due to low baby weight and breach position I had a scheduled C section. When my family had few doubts she patiently explained my family the reason why C section and precautions taken. Post delivery she counselled me as I was feeling low because of feeding issues. I am lucky to know a doctor like her and would definitely recommend to others.",

I have already referred most of my friends to her.\n\nTo begin with, I had a Normal Vaginal Delivery in Cloudnine hospital which was done by Dr. Sushmita. I was not able to conceive and so we went to her. She encourages us to try naturally first and then if nothing works out, only then she will suggest fertility treatments. I could conceive naturally with her advices and suggestions. We can blindly trust this doctor. She is an expert in her subject.\n\nWhile I was in labor room she consoled me so much and gave strength and made me feel so comfortable and my delivery was painless. I have a daughter today only because of Dr. Sushmita. I owe her big time. She is very friendly and straight forward. She is such an optimist person. She can turn depression into happiness. God bless you.\n\nShe remembers and knows every patient's history. She takes care of all her patients so well. She has delivered around 3000 babies. She comes with a great experience. She has so many patients and yet she is never tired. She works 24/7. A Wonder Woman.\n\nRegards, Seema",

The doctor was always polite, a good listener, understood the problems and proceeded with treatment on right direction. The doctor\u2019s confidence gave us some hope.\nWithin a month of consultation, my wife\u2019s period cycle was normal and within 2 months of consultation my wife was pregnant. \nThere were no tests or scans conducted during our consultation. We sincerely thank  the doctor for treating my wife with ease. *** ** *** ** *** **** ****** ** **** **** ******* \n\nAbout Cloud 9:\n1. The hospital has good infrastructure.\n2. We were initially told that the consultation is free if doctor requests visit within 3 days of previous consultation. However we were asked to pay 50% of consultation fee at the time of consultation. Please educate urself and do not manipulate things to customers.\n3. We had checked the pregnancy confirmation using several pregnancy kits and the results were positive. We did check for blood report sample at cloud 9, however the report was negative. We were shattered by the report.\n4. On doctor\u2019s advice, we did proceed with  blood test again on same day with another pathology center, however the result was positive. It\u2019s complete negligence by cloud 9.\n5. We would have recommended cloud 9 for delivery if the cost was reasonable. Please do not conduct any tests at cloud 9 since the cost of each test is double compared with other pathology Center.\n6. Cloud 9 can expect more and more customers from middle & upper middle class if the cost of delivery is reasonable or affordable.",

                "review_text": "Well, I'm writing this after a prolonged duration... My baby is 11months old as date... I have been so pleased and fortunate to have had Dr. Sushmita as my gyno... Our 1st baby, and to ensure or start on with our very important decision of our life, we did think of going for a consultation... The day we walked in to Motherhood Hospital, Sahakarnagar we were sent to see Dr. Sushmita... Did not know much about her, and during our wait period we did try to do a quick check on google to gather a little info about the doctor... Finally it was our turn to meet her, I was already a little worried and tensed and much more thought running in me, since it was the 1st time I'm right in front of my gyno to discuss with her that we have decided to plan for a baby... We seeked a prior consultation since I was under birth control tablets/pills, so opting a pre-consultation before conception is what me and my husband thought as important or ideal... To commence our pre-consultation, she did recommend a few tests to be thru... During these course I found her very very humble, polite and very friendly...she made us feel more like a family... Post my pre-consultation, within a duration or a month we were back again, and this time since my pregnancy test kit showed me the result as positive... And from then no looking back... Was meeting Dr. Sushmita very often during my check up and during the course, our bond gradually increased and it felt more great meeting her and knowing all about baby... She addresses to all your concerns with a smile on her face, I have time and again bothered her with more and more doubts, some valid ones and some not... nevertheless she did not hesitate to answer them all... She will share her contact number and incase of any concerns she's available on phone or msgs... And she motivates you to deliver normally, that's a plus point in her. And I'm so grateful to have had her during this beautiful journey of motherhood... I delivered a baby boy on 15th Nov 2017, normal delivery... If your seeing her and seeking her advise, I bet your in very safe and expertise hands.",

From day one she is very friendly and always with a smile explained the solution to my concerns. That is when I decided to continue with the doctor during my pregnancy also. In my pregnancy I had few complications as I was obese and in 27th week was diagnosed with gestational diabeties. As this was my first pregnancy I used to get tensed soon and also I had lot of questions to ask. Doctor used to listen to my queries and answer to it without any fustration. Also in every visit she used to share her personal experience, give me tips to handle stress and calm myself . Doctor was anytime available on call. Sometimes I used to call doctor at 11 pm in night with NST reports she was anytime available on call.  When nearing my delivery due to low baby weight and breach position I had a scheduled C section. When my family had few doubts she patiently explained my family the reason why C section and precautions taken. Post delivery she counselled me as I was feeling low because of feeding issues. I am lucky to know a doctor like her and would definitely recommend to others.",

I have already referred most of my friends to her.\n\nTo begin with, I had a Normal Vaginal Delivery in Cloudnine hospital which was done by Dr. Sushmita. I was not able to conceive and so we went to her. She encourages us to try naturally first and then if nothing works out, only then she will suggest fertility treatments. I could conceive naturally with her advices and suggestions. We can blindly trust this doctor. She is an expert in her subject.\n\nWhile I was in labor room she consoled me so much and gave strength and made me feel so comfortable and my delivery was painless. I have a daughter today only because of Dr. Sushmita. I owe her big time. She is very friendly and straight forward. She is such an optimist person. She can turn depression into happiness. God bless you.\n\nShe remembers and knows every patient's history. She takes care of all her patients so well. She has delivered around 3000 babies. She comes with a great experience. She has so many patients and yet she is never tired. She works 24/7. A Wonder Woman.\n\nRegards, Seema",

The doctor was always polite, a good listener, understood the problems and proceeded with treatment on right direction. The doctor\u2019s confidence gave us some hope.\nWithin a month of consultation, my wife\u2019s period cycle was normal and within 2 months of consultation my wife was pregnant. \nThere were no tests or scans conducted during our consultation. We sincerely thank  the doctor for treating my wife with ease. *** ** *** ** *** **** ****** ** **** **** ******* \n\nAbout Cloud 9:\n1. The hospital has good infrastructure.\n2. We were initially told that the consultation is free if doctor requests visit within 3 days of previous consultation. However we were asked to pay 50% of consultation fee at the time of consultation. Please educate urself and do not manipulate things to customers.\n3. We had checked the pregnancy confirmation using several pregnancy kits and the results were positive. We did check for blood report sample at cloud 9, however the report was negative. We were shattered by the report.\n4. On doctor\u2019s advice, we did proceed with  blood test again on same day with another pathology center, however the result was positive. It\u2019s complete negligence by cloud 9.\n5. We would have recommended cloud 9 for delivery if the cost was reasonable. Please do not conduct any tests at cloud 9 since the cost of each test is double compared with other pathology Center.\n6. Cloud 9 can expect more and more customers from middle & upper middle class if the cost of delivery is reasonable or affordable.",

She made me feel so comfortable in the OT. Ella was born in a wink and before I knew I was already stitched up and out of OT! Thank you so much Doctor. Things would have never been so smooth without you in this situation of a pandemic. Both Ella and I are happy and healthy!",

But I immediately decided she was the one who was going to help me deliver my baby. Doctor is so down to earth and she explained every process and test reports in layman terms and guided us throughout our delivery journey. Most important thing is she doesn't recommend medicines unless until required. She prefers medication through healthy diet. I had a healthy  delivery under her guidance. She and her team made sure my delivery was normal. Very much approachable and I would recommend her 100% to anyone who looks for a guiding hand than a gynaecologist for vaginal delivery. ",

With my pregnancy, she was my guide and counsellor and helped me through the toughest periods of my pregnancy. She was always available for a talk and always knew how to explain various scenarios to me and comfort me. When I needed psychological help,  she counselled me and helped me accept my role as a mother. Doctor is good at explaining things and is always willing to answer all our concerns. Even my family who live out of state and had come down for the delivery,  were bowled over by her commitment to me and my treatment. My pregnancy wouldn't have been memorable if not for doctor's care and guidance. She has a wonderful bedside manner and I gladly and wholeheartedly recommend her to all women who want an understanding and caring doctor to help them through the most important journey of their life.\nThank you Dr. Sushmita.",

So I needed somebody to guide me after listening to my case properly.Hence I connected with Dr Sushmita and she was amazing at answering all my questions with great level of patience.  After listening to my case history she told me that I need not even think of a C section and she also gave me mental support which was very much essential at that point.She is very knowledgeable and friendly. I can't put through words how relieved I was after talking to her and I must say, I was able to make an informed decision after talking to her. Thank a ton Dr Sushmita! ",

I got jaundice in my first trimester and Dr has guided me so beautifully. she is very friendly, approachable and always takes time and hears out all your concerns. Above all what I liked the most is that she is available when you need her and also that she hears out your birthing plan and is quite supportive . my mind was totally at ease with this pregnancy and lot of that credit goes to her, as she has always reassured me. I have loved my interactions with her and I will definitely recommend her to my friends and family. thank you very much Dr for your support.
