"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Consulted Dr. Rashmi Roogi for pregnancy and childbirth. 
(At Motherhood Hospital Banashankari, Ovum hospital Banashankari,  Raghavi Speciality Clinic Banashankari)

I was nervous about the whole process of pregnancy and childbirth and was hoping to find a doctor who could really understand my problems. And one fine day, I discover this Angelic Doctor !

Words fall short to describe her professionalism and sense of approach, truly one of a kind. She was patient enough to listen and understand my concerns and always helped to overcome them. No matter what the issue was, she was all ears. Rarely do we find such a  great Doctor !  

With such a great experience with her, I have been praising her among my family and friends so much so that even people in my hometown are familiar with her name.  We were truly impressed and amazed by her.  

All through this journey, she has been a  great support system, truly a gem.
