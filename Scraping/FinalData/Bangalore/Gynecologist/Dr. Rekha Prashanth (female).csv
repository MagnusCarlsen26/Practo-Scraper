"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Rekha is really good , very nice and firendly, she explain everything ,clear all doubts , certainly will continue treatment from her only.

Completely satisfied with treatement but below things also matters. 

First things, Its not Focus hospital, they have entirely different unit called ""Smiles"" and I felt like I was the only and first patient visiting this place. It could be because of lockdown also. 
Pharmacy  section I felt like they open it for first time and for us only, No proper bills for medicines , No card accepted , they are doing calculations on medicine cover just like old days grocery shop guys used to do. These are the very basic things, that should be there now a days.

When asked for bill , he said, they don't have it but when insisted then he said , he will mail it or provide day after. i'm sorry but I really doubt whether they have licence to operate this pharmacy shop for now.
