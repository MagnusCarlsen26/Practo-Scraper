Our fist visit became the best visit as we were pretty impressed by the  friendliness and professionalism maam had. She did understand our condition and did listen to our whole lot of stories and various complications, and other issues with our previous miscarriages.

After 2 miscarriages previously and other issues with my wife's uterus we had lost a hope of having a child, but after meeting Meenakshi maam her expertise, calmness and her way of handling things gave us a lot of confidence and trust which gave us a positive vibe of being parents.

Meenakshi maam is very knowledgeable and the technique or methods she uses in her treatment are mindblowing and remarkable. The success stories what we experienced and heard about Maam are to a great extent and appreciable

Today we are proud to be parents of a baby boy and the only reason for this is because of Maam, she is one of the best doctor whom we have ever seen through our entire life. Her dedication, support and knowledge has brought a success and praises which cant be explained.

Maam did take a personal care of us and she was available to us 24/7 which no other doctors would do.  She has also helped us to overcome all the consequences  throughout our entire pregnancy journey. 

Words fall short to us and cant be explained. the support, affection, care, treatment which we got from Maam are never forgetable. We will always be thankful to Maam from bottom of our heart. I proudly with raised head say it was the best decision we made to consult Maam for our pregnancy journey and i would always ask or request people to consult maam for any pregnacy or fertility related issues and you will see a postive change, happiness and joy in ur life.

Once again thank you maam for what all you have done to us and our family. We will always be thankful to you and u will remain in our hearts forever.

May you have lots and lots of success and happiness  in your life as well as carrer.
