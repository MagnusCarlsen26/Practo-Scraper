"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy Exercise,PCOD/PCOS Treatment,Family Planning,",0,0,YES,"Please visit Anjani without any second thought. 

I would definitely recommend Dr.Kalyani for planning and other gynac-issues. I met her about a year ago for conceiving problem. And, I am reviewing her hospital after a month of my Normal vaginal delivery, with my my bundle of joy right beside me!

My husband and I decided to meet a Gynac after trying to conceive for about 6 to 8 months in 2023, we fortunately met Dr.Kalyani. I was comfortable meeting her for the first time and decided to continue visiting her. She is an amiable person. Initially she went through my history-details thoroughly and asked me to do few preliminary checks.

Dr. Kalyani attends all her patients with due care, empathy and individual attention. Please feel free to meet her and discuss all your concerns with no hesitation. I'm sure the best possible resolution would be given to you. She tracked me well through my pregnancy when my family was away and my husband stood should to shoulder. This indeed helped me take great care of myself & my baby while I was carrying.

Dr.Kalyani's approach is always quite pragmatic. My BMI was already in required range. Thereby, 'weight' was never my concern. She noted that I was slightly anemic though my cycles were regular. She suspected ovarian cyst formation as I experienced signs of bloated stomach, though my cycles were monthly/ timed. My only signs of disorder were pimples and slightly bloated tummy. Also, my sleep patterns varied too, due to IT work/ shifts. She double checked for ""PCOD or cyst formation"" and if it is in the preliminary stage. She checked if I am ovulating properly (if Anovulatory), which was luckily not my case. Later, she confirmed that my major concern was Cyst-formation and prescribed medical-aid accordingly. Mild medication was suggested to me. She told that I would see the results in few months.

Of course, she made me incorporate certain changes in my diet and lifestyle. I followed them all with due diligence. Yet I used to express my anxiety during visits. She told us to be cool, carefree and enjoy the life before carrying, which is very true. In the next 3 months, it happened as she promised. I was tested positive during the beginning of my 2nd month of pregnancy. What more could I have asked for!

She always insists NVD or normal vaginal delivery. Hence, one must be mindful about the daily intake. It should be both balanced and fibrous in nature. (Please note, BMI ratio plays a crucial part here. It could become the cause of your health concern, if neglected). ""You are what you eat"" - as the saying goes.

Her clinic is well equipped, well maintained and modular. Both scanning facility and labor facility are available here. The protocols followed here are in favor of NVD. My scans were done quite efficiently though there were errors while printing one of my scan reports. Please cross-check before breaking down like me, thinking that all the effort went in vain. There is a Physiotherapy section too. Physiotherapist Gayathri taught me useful exercises, breathing techniques and birthing ball exercises from 36th week. The pelvic floor exercises really helped me reduce the pelvic muscle catch. The clinic is crowded by aspiring parents, but the labor unit is kept separate (yet interconnected) and conducive for delivery. This helped me walk around and exercise peacefully during my labor. I was able to firmly decide the next steps of my delivery when there was some risk posed at me.

I was very anxious about the pregnancy journey, I experienced heavy cramping in my 2nd month. In the initial 3 months I confined myself to a single room, due to extreme nausea. I was losing hope while dizziness and mood swings took over. I was unable to eat my meal (except 2-3 fruits) or enjoy a cup of warm milk, which I used to. I was unsure about reaching next trimester, if things would remain the same in future, etc. Dr. Kalyani pushed me and told that things shall pass. Yes, it did get better as she said.

The next 3 months were pleasant. I was bubbling with energy. Whenever I asked what is happening inside me, she would answer all my why's very elaborately and convincingly. I was told to maintain BMI, put on some weight (weight loss due to vomiting), take supplements regularly, focus on nutrition and eat healthy, which is always important. There were some false pains, etc, but my doctor was always available. All through my pregnancy, she has responded to my requests very quickly. She responds to both chat/ WhatsApp messages and urgent calls. She has attended my calls always, even during late night.

And the last trimester was a bit horrid due to my delivery-related concerns. ""It's all in your head"" - as the saying goes. I informed Dr.Kalyani that my family is away and could not get much help from them. I felt restless and used to lose sleep thinking of the labor day, stay awake to think about the how's. Problems were merely pondered, be it about bearing the birthing-pain, handling myself carefully until baby becomes full-term, taking care of my new born post delivery, adequately nurturing my child, etc. During one of my visits I enlisted my concerns, she gave solutions to each and every problem and instilled confidence in me to handle everything by myself. In fact, she told that it would be better to do things by self and remain active (Self-Help) than to rely on other family members. Also, when I reached the last leg of my pregnancy, she told my husband to not pamper me much. Her intent was good, so as to make me feel more responsible, deliver quickly and normally. Later, I had the same kind of delivery. My delivery pain subsided in few hours, though I slept on the birthing pain issue for months.  

At the mid of my labor, she gave me the liberty to choose NVG (normal vaginal delivery over C-section) though there was some undetected risk involved. Had I visited any other renowned hospital for my delivery, this wouldn't have been the case, I believe. We really admire the expertise with which she delivered our cord-around-the-neck baby normally.

We are thankful to the labor team for safe birthing experience. I cannot forget mentioning miss Revathi for her constant backing, great patience and assistance during labor. Post delivery, the day shift staff took much care of my new born and helped me feed in a right posture. All in all, it's been a pleasant journey with 'Anjani'. The very name is indeed powerful (she who ferverently prayed for a strong child, to beget Lord Hanuman as her son). Please visit Anjani and pass the toughest exam of womanhood with flying colors, just like Maa Anjani.

We wish you the best, team Anjani. Wish you the best, Dr.Kalyani, can't thank you enough ma'am. Wish the expecting mothers to have an easy delivery and healthy baby at Anjani :)",2024-08-07 18:50:56,False,True,Sharada,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"I am writing to extend my heartfelt thanks for the outstanding post-delivery care you provided. Your attentive and compassionate approach made a significant difference during my recovery period. 

One piece of advice my doctor consistently gave to me and others was to be cautious with our diets during the last trimester of pregnancy. Failing to do so could result in the baby growing too large, leading to severe complications during delivery and recovery. I strongly recommend that every expectant mother strictly follow their doctor's advice. 

During the last two months of pregnancy, it's essential to prioritize both the mother's and baby's health. Here are some precautions to consider: 

1. Regular prenatal check-ups: Keep up with scheduled appointments with your healthcare provider to monitor both the mother's and baby's health. 

2. Monitor baby's movements: Pay attention to the baby's movements and report any significant changes to your healthcare provider. 

3. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, which is crucial for both mother and baby. 

4. Get enough rest: Ensure adequate rest and sleep to support your body as it prepares for childbirth. 

5. Eat a balanced diet: Maintain a nutritious diet with a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. 

6. Avoid risky activities: Refrain from activities that could pose a risk to you or the baby, such as heavy lifting or strenuous exercise without clearance from your healthcare provider. 

7. Pelvic floor exercises: Practice pelvic floor exercises to prepare for labor and childbirth. 

8. Attend childbirth classes: Consider attending childbirth classes to learn about the labor process, relaxation techniques, and pain management strategies. 

9. Prepare for childbirth: Pack your hospital bag, make arrangements for transportation to the hospital, and discuss your birth plan with your healthcare provider. 

10. Stay informed: Keep yourself informed about signs of preterm labor or complications, such as preeclampsia, and seek medical attention if you experience any concerning symptoms.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Pregnancy care and management,",0,0,YES,"Hi Everyone, I want to share about my high-risk pregnancy experience. Because I had diabetes and was 35 years old when I gave birth, I was classified as having a high-risk pregnancy. My Hba1c was 8.4 at the time of conception, and I was rather worried about the fetal development. We went to the Anjani Hospital and had a consultation with Dr. Kalyani Reddy, madam. 

Dr. Kalyani inspired and counselled us and medications were provided. She also sent us to the dietician, Bindhu, who provided several recommendations for a diabetic diet, and to Dr. Prasanna Kumar, the diabetologist for diabetes control. Dr. Kalyani ensured that we are aware of potential difficulties, every screening step was completed at the appropriate time, and the risk was frequently discussed.

The scanning capability of Anjani Hospital is well built-in. Dr. Raja Munireddy performed all of my scans and the reports were shared on time. Dr. Kalyani madam, diabetologist Dr. Prasanna Kumar and Dr. Raja sir, collaborated and coordinated well. I took insulin the entire time I was pregnant. Because of high-risk pregnancy entails problems, I was worried about an early birth. However, with the support and guidance of Doctors a health baby was finally born at the 38th week. 

My child was delivered via caesarean section. We express our gratitude to Dr. Kalyani and Dr. Ravi, as well as the rest of the medical staff that assisted with my pregnancy care, delivery and post delivery care. I want to express my gratitude to everyone of the personnel, medical and non-medical, for the excellent care they gave us from the Day 1 we visited the hospital.

My Hba1c was 8.4 at the time of conception, and I was rather worried about the fetal development. We went to the Anjani Hospital and had a consultation with Dr. Kalyani Reddy, madam. 

Dr. Kalyani inspired and counselled us and medications were provided. She also sent us to the dietician, Bindhu, who provided several recommendations for a diabetic diet, and to Dr. Prasanna Kumar, the diabetologist for diabetes control. Dr. Kalyani ensured that we are aware of potential difficulties, every screening step was completed at the appropriate time, and the risk was frequently discussed.

The scanning capability of Anjani Hospital is well built-in. Dr. Raja Munireddy performed all of my scans and the reports were shared on time. Dr. Kalyani madam, diabetologist Dr. Prasanna Kumar and Dr. Raja sir, collaborated and coordinated well. I took insulin the entire time I was pregnant. Because of high-risk pregnancy entails problems, I was worried about an early birth. However, with the support and guidance of Doctors a health baby was finally born at the 38th week. 

My child was delivered via caesarean section. We express our gratitude to Dr. Kalyani and Dr. Ravi, as well as the rest of the medical staff that assisted with my pregnancy care, delivery and post delivery care. I want to express my gratitude to everyone of the personnel, medical and non-medical, for the excellent care they gave us from the Day 1 we visited the hospital. This was my incredible pregnancy adventure, and I'm sharing it to support future moms who may come across similar experience.",2024-05-10 10:37:36,False,True,Shilpa Kalaithendral,Thank you for your wonderful feedback üôèüèª,2024-05-20T03:48:54+0000,Dr. Kalyani C Reddy

"Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"I highly recommend Dr. Kalyani Reddy mam. She is a very patient, caring and practical person and tells you exactly what we need to do if we are looking forward for a normal delivery and welcome a healthy baby. She pushes us so much for a normal delivery which we don‚Äôt see much nowadays. I believe she is great doctor who really wants the best for us so just trust her and follow her advice. I have followed all her advices from the beginning! Mentioning a few of them if it helps any one of you:
1.Please give your body the rest if she tells that you need to rest especially in the first trimester.
2. We should be very mindful of what we eat! She clearly explains why it is so important to eat a balanced diet rich in fibre. So, please avoid a lot of carbs throughout your pregnancy and also avoid a lot of protein in the 8th and 9th month.You can ask her advice on the same. This mainly helps in maintaining baby‚Äôs weight. Of course we all need a healthy baby but we have to understand that even if the baby is not 3.5 kg we can still have a healthy baby. So, if we can maintain our diet in such a way that by our due date the weight is max around 3.2 kg there are high chances for you to have a normal delivery. I know there are other factors that should be considered but I am only talking about things that we can control.
3. Thirdly, keeping yourself hydrated and exercises. Walking does help but what helped me more were the pelvic exercises. You can take a session from the physiotherapist and continue to do it daily without stressing your body. It helps!
4. Please don‚Äôt panic during the delivery! I think remaining calm if possible, breathing normally and not holding your pelvic area tight is so important! Else all your efforts will go into vain because we couldn‚Äôt manage the stress in those last few hours. I did lose my calm for a few seconds may be a minute but had to pull myself back. I don‚Äôt know if this will help anyone as this was my personal hack that I saw in one of the videos. It is to use a comb to distract myself from the contraction pain during that last hour of delivery and it surely helped me! You never know it can help you too! 

Finally, I am very glad that I chose Anjani hospital and Kalyani reddy mam. A shout out Raja A Munireddy sir as well for his patience and how well he explains things during scans!

I cannot express gratitude in words though i would like to encourage every other pregnant girl to heed to what your Doctor has to say! Dr. Kalyani helped me overcome my fears when i was in my lowest . I had a missed abortion in late 2021 and after that i met Dr Kalyani in March 2022 just for a regular checkup , to know when can i plan for pregnancy further etc! I was so much in self doubt but i think with her counselling it was pretty easy to believe in myself and we naturally conceived in June 2022! My pregnancy journey has also been very smooth with all the medicines provided by Doc, i even had hypertension which i think never posed a problem for development of my baby throughout. In my last month after growth scans , we found out our baby‚Äôs weight was increasing, doc suggested if i want a normal delivery i have to make few changes to my diet and stick to exercise/walking without any fail! I stopped eating rice and wheat completely and switched to Ragi/Jowar/Millets! I used to do 5k-7k steps daily as suggested by Doc! I think this all honest guidance helped me deliver a healthy baby weighing 3.1kgs normally. Also i would like to mention that the delivery process was also so encouraging and seamless! Doc and sisters waited for everything to happen naturally! No pain induction or any such thing was even mentioned or done with me!

In this case actually doctors suggest for immediate c section, but Kalyani mam has patiently waited and suggested to take deep breaths which helped me to get my baby heartbeat to the required count and I had very intensive pains where at one point I had no control and asked for c section and at that point I was suggested if I can take Epidural(Pain less anesthesia) and with my acceptance I was given Epidural with which I got relief with my pains. With the help of mam and her staff in labour room I had given birth to a baby boy that too normal delivery. I had to mention the patience level of mam throughout my labour which is hard to see in almost all the hospitals these days and with my experience I can say that she almost tries and give time to her patients try for normal delivery. I should definitely mention the hospital staff and their friendly nature until I got discharged from hospital is highly appreciated.
I suggest kalyani mam for all the women who want a better experience thought out their pregency until their delivery and thanks to Dr Kalyani mam fir making my journey a wonderful one.",2021-02-14 18:49:32,False,True,Sai leela,Thank you for your wonderful feedback ,2021-02-16T05:22:39+0000,Dr. Kalyani C Reddy
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Cesarean Delivery,",0,0,YES,"I wish we had our first delivery done through Kalyani Ma'am but I guess we missed a big chunk of good things. She was diligent, throughout and extremely knowledgeable through out our visits. Guided us with practical steps throughout the journey. 

Re the admissions / billing, I'm so glad they are not like the corporate institutions. We came out paying 78K which was exactly what we had prepared for a c-sec and were told that it was not going to exceed that amount. On the day of the delivery, the doc was on time and her husband is another very gentle human being who kept us assured and informed throughout the process. The rooms was just what we needed. Though we didn't have some facilities but who cared? We went for a delivery and came out with out little super start. The nursing staff is super friendly and very helpful. They came every time we needed them and were helpful is assisting with the motor nursing and baby care. The paediatrician Dr. Narendra was also very through with the new born handling procedure guided us through just what was needed and nothing more. Guys, you really define the whole mother and baby care procedures in the day and age of corporates. We know you're set up for success, our request is that you keep this area of healthcare as it is now, no matter how big you grow. 

Thank you Kalyani Ma'am and the entire team of Anjani. We're so lucky to have met you. Thank you for doing what you do. God bless. 

Just a small area of opportunity: If there's anyway you can make the radiologist's room a little more soundproof, I think the Dr there would not have problems with the children outside running around. It is a birthing hospital after all. 

But otherwise, everything else was just awesome! Thank you so much again for a refreshing, different experience all together.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Cesarean Delivery,",0,0,YES,"I would like to share my experiences with you all. 
As soon as I got to know I am pregnant the very first question is which Doctor and Hospital to visit. 

I got to know about Doctor Kalyani and Anjani Hospital via 
BWP Bangalore Women Power Facebook group 
As I hunted the group to know the best doctor in Hennur though I was living in BTM 2nd stage as in near future I had to shift to Hennur area and I didn‚Äôt want to shift the file here n der so for the first 3 months of my pregnancy I travelled all the way from BTM 2nd stage to HBR layout

On BWP group many had recommended Dr. Kalyani from Anjani hospital so I Googled to see the hospital image to understand how the atmosphere will be there as I saw the image my heart was like this place is right and I will definitely will be comfortable here. 
Bcz I was very clear in my mind I don‚Äôt wanna go to any fancy brands of hospitals and was very particular what I was looking for. 

So Finally I visited Doctor Kalyani omg I must say she is such a beauty at heart  n her every smiling face makes you feel fresh. 
So well she guided during the whole pregnancy. 
Even Scan Doctor Raja he explains so well n tells all things in details. Doctor Ravi also guided and explained so well about the anaesthesia as mine was C session he gave confidence.
Doctor Narendra  the Paediatrician also guided so well for the babies do n don‚Äôt 

Even the  Nursing staff, Senior sister Sheena , Chaithra, , Supriya  & all other nurses for extending their support and they are always available for any help
And guide you so well in each and everything needed even for feeding the baby to burping the baby to diaper change n all. 
Even the house keeping staffs are very nice n friendly Nirmala n Bharati 

I can say hospital is very nice and very reasonable in terms of pricing and they have a dedicated person also to help you on insurance so that you don‚Äôt have to run here n there. 

Each room is spacious n well ventilated and is provided with oven, refrigerator, an attached bathroom with water heater.
Located in good area too.  

Over all it was great experience and happy delivery time. 
I keep referring n recommending ppl here so that they don‚Äôt miss the best place for the best experience of life.  

Keep the Good work Team.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Tests,",0,0,YES," This doctor is a very gentle and well-mannered doctor
The doctor speaks so softly that my wife was very happy and satisfied that everything would be fine
Eight months had passed and the ninth month had begun.
One night my wife suddenly stopped feeling moments we went to the doctor first
Doctor checked and said that the heartbeat was not feeling And then an ultrasound showed that the baby had died inside
As soon as it was known, the doctor admit my wife in his hospital
After that my wife started treatment.
Then I asked the doctor why they don't operate when it has happened.
We told the doctor why don't you do the operation when this has happened. The doctor told us that it is not appropriate for the baby to die in the womb, because of which the infection can spread in the body and the mother may have a problem.
So we should try to make the delivery normal
In the evening the doctor said that the delivery should be done by five o'clock in the morning and we will try.
When we were in the hospital, my wife was in a very bad condition and was crying a lot
The style of Dr. Kalyani Reddy and his staff is very good. They supported us a lot.
And because of their excellent treatment and encouragement, the delivery will be at 11:30 pm.
After the delivery, the doctor told us that the baby had died of relapse
The doctor is very gentle and good, very helpful
My wife said that delivery will be very easy with very little pain. Thank you doctor.
These were my wife's words.
We ask Allah to help those who helped us.

The good reviews on Practo also helped us in deciding the same. Since the first visit from Jan 2021, the doctor was friendly, communicable, explained all things candidly. We immediately felt at ease and felt confident in receiving expert medical care. The radiologist, nursing staff, and other hospital staff were also helpful and supportive throughout my pregnancy. Doctor asked for our preference for delivery and we wanted it to be a normal delivery. From our first visit itself, the doctor monitored every aspect of my pregnancy. Based on the same doctor judged my and baby's health for normal delivery throughout gestation and carried out safe and normal delivery in spite of delayed dilation. She advised me to have regular walks, squats, Kegels, and using the Indian toilet for aid in normal delivery. The doctor took utmost care of me and my baby at the time of delivery and was available all the time whenever required. She was constantly monitoring me and my baby's vitals throughout the gestation. She also advised us to go for Stem cell banking, the hospital took expert care in collecting and preserving the same during the delivery. We were very impressed with the doctor's expertise, calmness, ease of communication, smiling nature, and candid communication during the tense times. We kept faith in her methods since the first visit and have never regretted it. Radiologist Dr. Munireddy and anesthetist Dr. Kumar were also available and gave expert timely advice. 
We are very happy with the medical treatment and service we received at Anjani Hospital, all of the staff was great they were helpful, patient, and helpful with all our queries. The staff is friendly and always ensures that we got properly informed about my health and post-natal care. We are so glad that we chose Anjani Hospital and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone.

Actually I started consulting Dr. Kalyani from my 5th month of 2nd pregnancy. I could find her through practo. Thanks to practo for that. The reviews about Anjani hospital and Kalyani maam and her team what we see here are absolutely right. Dr.Kalyani is the passionate doctor I have ever seen in my life. In this covid situation, she gave me full confidence and care like one of my family members.My baby came to head down position from 4 weeks before when it is supposed to happen. Kalyani ma'am immediately noticed it and suggested the precautions to be followed to avoid premature delivery. With her guidance and God's grace, I could deliver my little angel at 38 weeks which is considered to be perfectly full term. The day when I delivered my baby was one of the days where covid cases were at its peak in Bangalore. The entire hospital team put special efforts and care to maintain all hygiene and precautions against covid situation and I got the best care one can expect. And the delivery package and all other fee are very affordable and reasonable. Special mention to the scans done by Dr. Raja. He explains the scanning results in a layman's language so that we could get a comfort after scanning. The team of sisters are highly passionate and they all have well co-ordination. The labour room staff sister chaitra, tamizh and all sisters were very encouraging which helped me to bear even the very intense pains at some stage of my delivery.

The delivery process was not easy for my wife The water broke out  in the middle of the night and the labour process took very long around 22Hrs. Even though long hours waiting the delivery was not easy we had faced many critical complications.

One of the main reasons for delivery not happening easily is my wife did not follow proper physiotherapy session.

The importance of decision making was important during delivery by doctor there Dr Kalyani Madam played a vital role and she is excellent have high patience level.
Through out the delivery process doctor and nurses were so patience and supportive

Just follow whatever doctor say blindly including tips diets and everything. Which are really helpful for normal delivery like exercises, breathing exercises, etc.
Do whatever doctor says.

The hospital staff, rooms, room service, nursing staff are very friendly and kind in nature. The rooms are clean and tidy.
NOTE: Taking classes from Physiotherapy is mandatory for normal delivery.

Exercise plays a major role,especially in the 9th month of pregnancy if you want to have normal delivery. Exercising regularly will surely help to combat stress and pain of labour.

We started our journey with Anjani clinic with pre pregnancy check up, that time I was detected with PCOS. After Kalyani Maam's proper guidance and support i was able to conceive within 2 month. We used to do all our tests and scans at Anjani hospital from the beginning which is hassle-free and cost effective unlike many other private hospital. 
During this covid time if we get all the facility for Mom and Child at one one place then it's a opportunity that everyone wants to take.The doctors and staff are very caring and explains each thing with utmost clarity. 
Since from the beginning we wanted normal delivery, Kalyani Ma'am guided us throughout pregnancy on proper weight gain, exercise, diabetic control ,diet and at the end we are able to deliver our baby boy normally with minimal recover time of Mother. Last but not the least during labor mental support from Dr.Kalyani and Dr.Ravi and entire nursing staff is commendable. The way nurses helped and guided throughout Labour pain is incredible !

Dr Kalyani really stresses on normal delivery and I have seen patients who were voluntarily opting for C-Section changed their minds after consulting her and had smooth normal deliveries. I have referred 3 of my friends and all of them had normal deliveries.

More importantly the decision we made to get the delivery done at their own clinic Ajani hospital was the best decision.
My wife had undergone cesarean and we stayed in the hospital for 4 days. The kind of care, support, empathy and service they have provided is extraordinary. As this is our second kid our elders were taking care of the 1st kid at home and I was alone with my wife at hospital but each and everything what is expected from elders were taken care by the hospital staff showing lot of patience in helping mother and baby.  
Services during our stay like providing food for mother, helping mother to feed the baby, feeding baby with supplements whenever required, bath for both mother&baby, changing diapers all these were done by professional nursing staff. 
More importantly though the package was covering the stay for 3 days we requested to stay another day as it is an auspicious day and we were not charged for the extra day. Again, this is subject to availability of rooms. The reason for mentioning this is it tell how liberal they are with respect to money and payments. Very rarely seen in these contemporary days.

Here goes our experience with Anjani Hospital & our Doctor. 

During Pregnancy :

I have undergone normal delivery under the guidance of Kalyani Madam. 
All credits to her to motivate me & to safeguard me & my baby during my pregnancy phase and during delivering baby. 
She is the one who treats  patients personally and rises her professional standard to next level! 
Hats off for her patience in making us to move forward with good vibes! 
Moral support we got from Dr. Kalyani Madam, Dr. Ravi & Dr. Raja munireddy sir is commendable. 
Kalyani madam always takes precautions for healthy baby & easy delivery. We can blindly follow her inputs for a better output, can say. 
Though I had PCOD problem, she never suggested any medicine when we met her for children. In fact, she just said, reduce weight & you will be on track with your goal. 

During Delivery :

Thanks a lot for the Nursing staff, Ms. Chaithra, Ms. Vasudha, Mrs. Sheena & all other nurses for extending their support all the time. 
Staff is always available for any help & they are very pro active. 
The way they maintained hygiene in cleaning up & dressing us should really be appreciated! 

After Delivery :

Infant baby bath & Warm water bath for mother are followed with proper protocol. 
Red light therapy is used to heal the stitches faster. This gave me lot of relief from pains. 

Baby Care :

Staff takes care of making us to feed the baby immediately after delivery. 
Dr. Narendra, Pediatrician also assisted us properly & alerted us regarding feeding the baby in proper time intervals. 

Regarding Anjani Hospital :

It's maintained in a super hygienic way! 
Can say to the level of a star hotel with pro active staff. 
Proper food is given to patients under doctor's guidance. 
Each room is spacious and is provided with oven, refrigerator, an attached bathroom with water heater. 
Located in good layout too.

I was very happy with the way she heard me out (it was my first) hence had a lot of doubts.she patiently heard me out and explained everything. I was also very happy with the covid measures taken by the hospital.Doctor Raja takes a lot of time to check each patient which can be annoying because they give you a time slot and never complete as per the time. Scanning process is extremely painful as he presses your stomach with the machine and checks. he should be a little gentle. he is also a little intimidating as he keeps screaming at his juniors.also the night duty nurses are very rude..particularly some dame named Parvarthi..i was admitted in the night and she came barging in and did not explain what she would be doing. whenever I asked her she used to say i know what i am doing..Also after my surgery, I had a c sec she came into the room during night time and I guess she was in her sleep..started speaking to my baby who was not feeding well.. she said ""drink fast, even I have to sleep""really did not expect a Nurse to behave like this. I wish doctor Kalyani had better nurses. there were two nurses during night time both were very bad.Kalyani mam's husband comes during the end and is very supportive and friendly..but he needs to know and understand the patient , he tries to be over friendly when the patient is all tensed.There is sister Sheena who is exrremely helpful and understanding All in all if you have a problem yes Kalyani doc is the best but I am not happy with the staff.also please reduce the waiting time. its almost like you have to leave everything planned for the entire day to visit the doc.i have already recommended her to my friends, she is really very good",2021-06-08 14:45:00,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
