                "review_text": "Hi..Meet me Bharath & my wife Pallavi, yet another Software Engineer working for Big IT firms. When it comes to choosing Doctors, we always tend to go for a known Doctors. Same was with our case. We were doing Hit Refresh after 5 years. We have a son who is 5 years old. I am native of Davangere and as the schools were all online mode due to COVID, we kind off shifted to Davangere. It was December when my wife gave good news of our second pregnancy. We were doing all the regular check-ups with our known Dr. Divakar and everything was going well.\n\nHow did we meet Dr Geetha Nagarjun?\n\nAs the schools started and everything was offline, we shifted back to Bengaluru. It was June 24th; we were all set for our New Housewarming ceremony and my wife was 31 weeks pregnant. On that day my wife started bleeding. For a moment, my whole body became cold, and I was clueless on what had to be done. I quickly called up Dr. Divakar and explained the situation to him. He took some time and called me back and asked me to rush to MotherHood hospital near Devegowda Petrol Bunk and meet Dr. Geetha Nagarjun. He had met her during one of the conferences. Dr Divakar had informed Geetha with our situation. We asked our parents to carry on with the Housewarming pooja and we both started towards MotherHood hospital. It was close to 7kms from our House. Lots of negative thoughts going in our mind and not sure what will happen next. We reached the hospital around 7:30AM, Dr Geetha had already informed at the reception, and we were rushed to first floor for scanning. During the scan, the baby\u2019s heartbeat and movements were normal and it gave a sigh of relief for us. Because of Dr. Geetha we didn\u2019t go through the hassle of doing the registration at the Hospital until things got stabilized. My wife was admitted and was kept for observation for 4 days. In these 4 days, the only question that was going through my mind was \u201cWhat If\u201d. Dr Geetha explained to me about all the pros and cons and her aim was to put her under observation and see that we can push the delivery by couple of weeks as nothing can replace mother\u2019s womb for baby\u2019s development. Every day they used to scan and see the progress. On day 1, there was bleeding with adequate liquor. Day2, clots were gone, and liquor had reduced. Humans are prone to errors. Dr Geetha didn\u2019t want to take a chance. She wanted to take a third opinion from a different radiologist and this time everything was normal, and we were discharged. She advised my wife to take complete bed rest.\n\nPost Meeting Dr Geetha\nMotherHood has a clinic in Kanakapura Main Road and Dr Geetha comes for consultation into that clinic. We had our regular checkups there and luckily my wife was able to complete 38 weeks of pregnancy. When the due date is nearing, the questions that come to everybody\u2019s mind: will it be Normal or \u2018C\u2019 Section. Dr Geetha did her due diligence and suggested us for a C-Section. When it comes to our Indian tradition, given an option we always pick a date and time for good things to happen. Similarly, we fixed it for Aug 15th between 12 PM to 2:30 PM. Dr Geetha was very accommodative to do the delivery during this time. Every story should have a happy ending. On Aug 15th, we were blessed with a little angel.\n \nDr Geetha Nagarjun was great in both handling the complication that we faced and in delivering us our little princess. Dr Geetha is not just a very good as a doctor but is empathetic as well. She has very good experience despite being so young. All her suggestions & directions given throughout the last trimester journey helped us sail through the pregnancy & delivery at ease.\nMy wife was highly concerned about the delivery process and post-delivery pain & recovery. But, with Dr. Geetha\u2019s support this phase was comfortable.\nThank you Dr. Geetha for Everything.\n\n\n",

I was carrying twins due to covid pandemic i changed doctor as there was no proper response for regular checkup and later on my friends suggestion met Dr. Geetha on my 5th month of pregnancy. She is good hearted person with amazing smile always on her face, she clears very patiently even a small doubt asked numbers of times through phone or in person. I made right choice of choosing her. As i had cervical stitch in 3rd month from previous doctor, I use to say I need C-Section because of twins, need of NICU care and cervical stitch but Dr. Geetha encouraged me saying that she can try for normal delivery though it is twins with cervical stitch with complete bed rest.  At 36 weeks, around 2AM at home my water bag broke, called Dr. Geetha she asked us to come immediately to hospital. Dr Geetha came immediately to see me at 3am. I remember she said I was only 1cm dilated and not in labour. She removed my cervical stitch. She inserted gel to increase my labour pains, as I had leaked most of the water at home. Dr Geetha said by inserting gel, pain will increase, and chances r there for normal delivery. Within half an hour I had excruciating pain and me and my family asked for C-Section as I couldnot bear pains. Dr Geetha convinced me  and councelled to go for epidural. I took Epidural analgesia. Later my pains completely reduced. I had a Painless NORMAL DELIVERY for TWINS.  She did it and helped me achieve my bundle of joy.  I had a healthy male baby weighing 2.8kg at 11:55am, healthy female baby weighing 2.5kg at 12:04pm in may 2020. Though Dr Geetha had 3months old baby she was with me throughout my labour from 3am to 1:30pm and gave me lots of courage and extremely so supportive.. I was surprised to see someone with so much dedication towards her patients. I feel lucky in that way. I heard many are going for c section because of pandemic. Though I was on shorter side ( 5 feet), with cervical stitch with twins, water bag broke with all this I had normal delivery.  \nPatience that Dr geetha kept during delivery is really appreciated. I would suggest all my friends and others to go for Dr Geetha Nagarjuna.  Thank you so much Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna for so much caring and responsibility as i felt Iam with my own family. Especially during these COVID times, it was an absolute blessing to have a doctor like her by my side. I strongly and blindly recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna.",

Like all other 1st time parents, we were having lots of doubts, confusions and curiosity about the parenthood, But as they say that when you have doubts, pray to God and go with the flow. We selected Motherhood and Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna based on google reviews and it was the best thing that we did. She is an amazing and humble doctor we have met so far. She is very transparent, passionate and approachable. We consulted her from day 1 and our journey with her has been incredible. She guided me so well regarding diet, exercises n everything regarding pregnancy. She is very approachable & directly available on calls and whatsapp for all queries/concerns 24x7 even in her hectic schedule, you will be surprised at the super quick responses you get each time from her don't recall having any troubled thoughts later. Whenever we visit hospital she welcomes with her warm smile and whatever doubt we ask she used to guide us even for small questions.\nRegaring labour, seriously we were so tensed because baby weight was 3.8kg and we have lost the hope about normal delivery but Geetha mam given confidence in us and we have delivered (normal) healthy boy baby. Geetha mam specialist in that, Honestly telling in the beginning we have thought that who has insurance they will end up with c-section but our prediction was wrong it is not that whether you have insurance or not, it's completely depends on baby position.\nWe strongly recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna, we have to do what she suggests then everything will be all right. Thank you Dr\nGeetha Nagarjuna mam.\nTo add thanks to Dr. Lissy who helped during labour and the support staff, Nurse, house keeping Aunty, I would definitely like to extend my thanks to the entire team of Motherhood Banashankari and MH Kanakpura clinic for ensuring the smooth transition to the new role of Parenthood and making it memorable from time to time by organizing few celebrations and learning sessions.

Not only has she taken great care towards my mom surgery of uterus removal,  but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient!\n\nI would personally like to explain about my mom situation, we got to know 4years back, that mom  had a Fibroids in the uterus, god's grace she dint suffer the stomach ache, but slowly she got all the side effects, seviour pain in knee and toe, trust us we met all the fine doctors in the city, and everyone said to get the fibroid removed through the major surgery, as mom had already crossed 40+ , she kept on postponed to avoid surgery at this age ...\n\nWhen we finally decided to undergo the surgery, we again got one more reference and went to Dr.geetha nagarjun,\nwith the first appointment itself, she gave lots of hope and gave us lots of confidence about the surgery, after all the tests done she said she can do it through laproscopy instead of major surgery, wi should really thank her from the bottom of my heart,\nThe operation which we postponed for 4 years , finally when Dr.Geetha gave us a hope of laproscopy surgery , we dint gave a second thought, and we made the surgery done within a week,\nGodsgrace surgery was success and mom is safe here and happy\n\nAll thanks to the doctor.\ud83d\ude0aand i definitely recommend Dr geetha nagarjun. Her guidance and consultation made all our confusion clear and and gave mom lots of confidence to undergo the surger.",

With such care and knowledge that she carries, we were impressed with first consultation the way she explains things. She almost finished all her consultation we were last to see. But she could still spent about 20mins explaining do and dont\u2019s, symptoms which is common during pregnancy, about diet and exercises. My wife pregnancy went so smooth that she didn't even feel pregnant all through nine months; my wife trusted and followed her all through pregnancy, including diet, exercises, yoga, lamaze, resulting a smooth nine months and my wife had a happy normal delivery of baby boy of weight 3.9kgs. Baby was on the bigger side, where doctor took so much of risk to deliver my wife normally. Doctor waited for almost 22hours. I really appreciate for her patience, support which she gave us at the time of labour. My wife recovered so fast after a normal delivery. We were lucky we found her in Motherhood hospitals- Banashankari. Doctor is available 24*7 for our questions and promptly followed up with me on how I was doing all through pregnancy. Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna is the next best thing happened to us after our baby during this pregnancy.\u00a0I recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna more than 100%. If you're looking for a Gynaec and who wants normal delivery look no further, ***** *** **** *** ***** ******* ** ********** ** ******** ********* ** ****** doctor will just do what is right for you and your health profile.Thank you doctor",

Who made my wife birthing experience easy and enjoyable. We started consulting Dr Geetha Ma'am at motherhood Banashankari . My wife first and second trimester very smooth.\u00a0\u00a0My wife was regular with my diet , walk and exercise as well as easily managing office. But as soon as she entered third trimester multiple problems started. First in GCT got to know that my wife is\u00a0\u00a0in higher side of gestational diabetes then got diagnosed with cholestasis in pregnancy and then got to know that umbilical cord is around our baby's neck because of that baby was not moving much. Everyone told that my wife will be having ceaseron delivery there is no chance of normal but in this whole world Geetha Ma'am came as only hope for us. She told us if we are mentally prepared for normal delivery then we can do normal delivery.\u00a0\u00a0She induced my wife at 38 weeks, and as she promised my wife delivered a healthy baby girl on 16th jan via normal delivery weight 3.6kgs. And my wife followed her instructions very strictly and my wife and baby are doing good. If you live in Bangalore and are expecting a baby please close your eyes and associate with Dr Geetha Nagarjuna. You can trust her 100%.Finding a doctor who cares is a blessing and Dr. Geetha mam falls under this category. A great doctor for vaginal delivery,\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Geetha nagarjuna, you are a great doctor but beyond that you are an amazing human being.-Thank You!",

We were thoroughly guided by her and she took utmost care of the mother and the baby throughout the duration. Dr Geetha has been god sent for us. she took utmost care of me and gave individual attention during my term.\u00a0\u00a0Even in times of covid, she was accessible at all hours and on non consultation days too. she goes beyond the call of duty as a doctor to ensure well being of her patients and thoroughly explains each step as you progress in your pregnancy. Any concerns if I have and call to her personal phone she would always answer all my calls, she never takes consultation fees for any phone consultations or any wats app video consultations. She will just refuse to accept the consultation fee. Hardly we find doctors like her these days.\u00a0\u00a0I could enjoy the full term and with her guidance, I Had a NORMAL DELIVERY only because of her support and guidance. We are blessed with a baby boy weighing 3.8kgs and we\u2019ll always be thankful to mam. Though it is a big baby, She encouraged me for a natural delivery. All my family and friends thought I would land up in c- section because of weight of the baby. My family dint want to risk with normal delivery complications and asked doctor for C section. Doctor said she can still try for normal delivery though it is a big baby. She suggested various exercises and remedies to ease my discomfort and I was able to recover soon after delivery. She is one of the most polite and knowledgeable doctor in the city. She knows her patients well and ensures to make the journey easy. She is a delight to meet and consult. We strongly recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna. All the pregnant women are advised to consult her for their pregnancy journey. She is the best doctor in Bangalore and practicing in MOTHERHOOD HOSPITAL- BANASHANKARI. Thank you mam for everything.\u00a0\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0a",

She was very approachable. \nTo begin; my wife was getting checked in Cambridge Hospital near to my house. Visiting was twice in a month and scanning almost every visit; since there was no Cashless Insurance here I was looking for alternative. \nThen I was suggested this Dr. Geetha  and  I visited her from the end of 7th month of my wife pregnancy. *** **** *** ******* ************ ********* literally none scanning was done till delivery. \n\nDelivery day: My wife felt the water bag is breaking at 1:40 AM Monday; immediately I took her to Motherhood, Bsk. reached there at 1:50 AM, I just whats app ed a message to Dr. Geetha; saying she is admitted; that was about 2 AM. At 2:20 AM she replied that she has spoken to duty doctors.  I went back home to pick up essential item as was back in an hour. By the Dr, Geetha was in LDR, she said the delivery might happen any movement ; she also gave me a chance to witness the last few minutes of normal delivery at one corner side.\nI was moved and speechless when I saw the infant. This was my first experience though its my 2nd child. When she congratulated me; I could not even say Thankyou.\nI had to leave and wait outside the LDR; at bout 5 AM Dr. Geetha came out of LDR and said both are fine. Then I had voice and thanked her.\n\nPost Pregnancy and Hospitalization:\nShe visited every day evening enquiring health of my wife and giving necessary suggestions. All 3 days till discharge.\n\nThe doctors response; care; follow up is all extremely good. I would strongly suggest and recommend. I was suggested by my cousin who underwent delivery couple of years ago; hers too was a normal delivery. This way I visited her.\n\nHospital : Mohterhood Banagiri, Bengaluru opp; KIMS\nTo say  I was extremely satisfied with the Nurse and Care takers there.\nThey were doing their job wholeheartedly without any expectations from us. The care being given by them when every baby cries at night was superb. I felt they are like another mother there.\nOn discharge day when we offered some tips to the Nurse they refused.\nSuch is their commitment \n\nI am happy both with the Doctor and the Hospital",

                "review_text": "Hi..Meet me Bharath & my wife Pallavi, yet another Software Engineer working for Big IT firms. When it comes to choosing Doctors, we always tend to go for a known Doctors. Same was with our case. We were doing Hit Refresh after 5 years. We have a son who is 5 years old. I am native of Davangere and as the schools were all online mode due to COVID, we kind off shifted to Davangere. It was December when my wife gave good news of our second pregnancy. We were doing all the regular check-ups with our known Dr. Divakar and everything was going well.\n\nHow did we meet Dr Geetha Nagarjun?\n\nAs the schools started and everything was offline, we shifted back to Bengaluru. It was June 24th; we were all set for our New Housewarming ceremony and my wife was 31 weeks pregnant. On that day my wife started bleeding. For a moment, my whole body became cold, and I was clueless on what had to be done. I quickly called up Dr. Divakar and explained the situation to him. He took some time and called me back and asked me to rush to MotherHood hospital near Devegowda Petrol Bunk and meet Dr. Geetha Nagarjun. He had met her during one of the conferences. Dr Divakar had informed Geetha with our situation. We asked our parents to carry on with the Housewarming pooja and we both started towards MotherHood hospital. It was close to 7kms from our House. Lots of negative thoughts going in our mind and not sure what will happen next. We reached the hospital around 7:30AM, Dr Geetha had already informed at the reception, and we were rushed to first floor for scanning. During the scan, the baby\u2019s heartbeat and movements were normal and it gave a sigh of relief for us. Because of Dr. Geetha we didn\u2019t go through the hassle of doing the registration at the Hospital until things got stabilized. My wife was admitted and was kept for observation for 4 days. In these 4 days, the only question that was going through my mind was \u201cWhat If\u201d. Dr Geetha explained to me about all the pros and cons and her aim was to put her under observation and see that we can push the delivery by couple of weeks as nothing can replace mother\u2019s womb for baby\u2019s development. Every day they used to scan and see the progress. On day 1, there was bleeding with adequate liquor. Day2, clots were gone, and liquor had reduced. Humans are prone to errors. Dr Geetha didn\u2019t want to take a chance. She wanted to take a third opinion from a different radiologist and this time everything was normal, and we were discharged. She advised my wife to take complete bed rest.\n\nPost Meeting Dr Geetha\nMotherHood has a clinic in Kanakapura Main Road and Dr Geetha comes for consultation into that clinic. We had our regular checkups there and luckily my wife was able to complete 38 weeks of pregnancy. When the due date is nearing, the questions that come to everybody\u2019s mind: will it be Normal or \u2018C\u2019 Section. Dr Geetha did her due diligence and suggested us for a C-Section. When it comes to our Indian tradition, given an option we always pick a date and time for good things to happen. Similarly, we fixed it for Aug 15th between 12 PM to 2:30 PM. Dr Geetha was very accommodative to do the delivery during this time. Every story should have a happy ending. On Aug 15th, we were blessed with a little angel.\n \nDr Geetha Nagarjun was great in both handling the complication that we faced and in delivering us our little princess. Dr Geetha is not just a very good as a doctor but is empathetic as well. She has very good experience despite being so young. All her suggestions & directions given throughout the last trimester journey helped us sail through the pregnancy & delivery at ease.\nMy wife was highly concerned about the delivery process and post-delivery pain & recovery. But, with Dr. Geetha\u2019s support this phase was comfortable.\nThank you Dr. Geetha for Everything.\n\n\n",

I was carrying twins due to covid pandemic i changed doctor as there was no proper response for regular checkup and later on my friends suggestion met Dr. Geetha on my 5th month of pregnancy. She is good hearted person with amazing smile always on her face, she clears very patiently even a small doubt asked numbers of times through phone or in person. I made right choice of choosing her. As i had cervical stitch in 3rd month from previous doctor, I use to say I need C-Section because of twins, need of NICU care and cervical stitch but Dr. Geetha encouraged me saying that she can try for normal delivery though it is twins with cervical stitch with complete bed rest.  At 36 weeks, around 2AM at home my water bag broke, called Dr. Geetha she asked us to come immediately to hospital. Dr Geetha came immediately to see me at 3am. I remember she said I was only 1cm dilated and not in labour. She removed my cervical stitch. She inserted gel to increase my labour pains, as I had leaked most of the water at home. Dr Geetha said by inserting gel, pain will increase, and chances r there for normal delivery. Within half an hour I had excruciating pain and me and my family asked for C-Section as I couldnot bear pains. Dr Geetha convinced me  and councelled to go for epidural. I took Epidural analgesia. Later my pains completely reduced. I had a Painless NORMAL DELIVERY for TWINS.  She did it and helped me achieve my bundle of joy.  I had a healthy male baby weighing 2.8kg at 11:55am, healthy female baby weighing 2.5kg at 12:04pm in may 2020. Though Dr Geetha had 3months old baby she was with me throughout my labour from 3am to 1:30pm and gave me lots of courage and extremely so supportive.. I was surprised to see someone with so much dedication towards her patients. I feel lucky in that way. I heard many are going for c section because of pandemic. Though I was on shorter side ( 5 feet), with cervical stitch with twins, water bag broke with all this I had normal delivery.  \nPatience that Dr geetha kept during delivery is really appreciated. I would suggest all my friends and others to go for Dr Geetha Nagarjuna.  Thank you so much Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna for so much caring and responsibility as i felt Iam with my own family. Especially during these COVID times, it was an absolute blessing to have a doctor like her by my side. I strongly and blindly recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna.",

After experiencing the heartache of a miscarriage a year prior, my husband and I were understandably anxious about trying again. However, from the moment we met Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna, our fears began to dissipate.\n\nDr. Geetha Nagarjuna's professionalism and expertise are unparalleled.

Like all other 1st time parents, we were having lots of doubts, confusions and curiosity about the parenthood, But as they say that when you have doubts, pray to God and go with the flow. We selected Motherhood and Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna based on google reviews and it was the best thing that we did. She is an amazing and humble doctor we have met so far. She is very transparent, passionate and approachable. We consulted her from day 1 and our journey with her has been incredible. She guided me so well regarding diet, exercises n everything regarding pregnancy. She is very approachable & directly available on calls and whatsapp for all queries/concerns 24x7 even in her hectic schedule, you will be surprised at the super quick responses you get each time from her don't recall having any troubled thoughts later. Whenever we visit hospital she welcomes with her warm smile and whatever doubt we ask she used to guide us even for small questions.\nRegaring labour, seriously we were so tensed because baby weight was 3.8kg and we have lost the hope about normal delivery but Geetha mam given confidence in us and we have delivered (normal) healthy boy baby. Geetha mam specialist in that, Honestly telling in the beginning we have thought that who has insurance they will end up with c-section but our prediction was wrong it is not that whether you have insurance or not, it's completely depends on baby position.\nWe strongly recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna, we have to do what she suggests then everything will be all right. Thank you Dr\nGeetha Nagarjuna mam.\nTo add thanks to Dr. Lissy who helped during labour and the support staff, Nurse, house keeping Aunty, I would definitely like to extend my thanks to the entire team of Motherhood Banashankari and MH Kanakpura clinic for ensuring the smooth transition to the new role of Parenthood and making it memorable from time to time by organizing few celebrations and learning sessions. Biggest joy is holding your little one in your hand and it was really possible because of you guys.\n\nThanks,\nShruthi Gowda",

Not only has she taken great care towards my mom surgery of uterus removal,  but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient!\n\nI would personally like to explain about my mom situation, we got to know 4years back, that mom  had a Fibroids in the uterus, god's grace she dint suffer the stomach ache, but slowly she got all the side effects, seviour pain in knee and toe, trust us we met all the fine doctors in the city, and everyone said to get the fibroid removed through the major surgery, as mom had already crossed 40+ , she kept on postponed to avoid surgery at this age ...\n\nWhen we finally decided to undergo the surgery, we again got one more reference and went to Dr.geetha nagarjun,\nwith the first appointment itself, she gave lots of hope and gave us lots of confidence about the surgery, after all the tests done she said she can do it through laproscopy instead of major surgery, wi should really thank her from the bottom of my heart,\nThe operation which we postponed for 4 years , finally when Dr.Geetha gave us a hope of laproscopy surgery , we dint gave a second thought, and we made the surgery done within a week,\nGodsgrace surgery was success and mom is safe here and happy\n\nAll thanks to the doctor.\ud83d\ude0aand i definitely recommend Dr geetha nagarjun. Her guidance and consultation made all our confusion clear and and gave mom lots of confidence to undergo the surger.",

With such care and knowledge that she carries, we were impressed with first consultation the way she explains things. She almost finished all her consultation we were last to see. But she could still spent about 20mins explaining do and dont\u2019s, symptoms which is common during pregnancy, about diet and exercises. My wife pregnancy went so smooth that she didn't even feel pregnant all through nine months; my wife trusted and followed her all through pregnancy, including diet, exercises, yoga, lamaze, resulting a smooth nine months and my wife had a happy normal delivery of baby boy of weight 3.9kgs. Baby was on the bigger side, where doctor took so much of risk to deliver my wife normally. Doctor waited for almost 22hours. I really appreciate for her patience, support which she gave us at the time of labour. My wife recovered so fast after a normal delivery. We were lucky we found her in Motherhood hospitals- Banashankari. Doctor is available 24*7 for our questions and promptly followed up with me on how I was doing all through pregnancy. Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna is the next best thing happened to us after our baby during this pregnancy.\u00a0I recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna more than 100%. If you're looking for a Gynaec and who wants normal delivery look no further, ***** *** **** *** ***** ******* ** ********** ** ******** ********* ** ****** doctor will just do what is right for you and your health profile.Thank you doctor",

Who made my wife birthing experience easy and enjoyable. We started consulting Dr Geetha Ma'am at motherhood Banashankari . My wife first and second trimester very smooth.\u00a0\u00a0My wife was regular with my diet , walk and exercise as well as easily managing office. But as soon as she entered third trimester multiple problems started. First in GCT got to know that my wife is\u00a0\u00a0in higher side of gestational diabetes then got diagnosed with cholestasis in pregnancy and then got to know that umbilical cord is around our baby's neck because of that baby was not moving much. Everyone told that my wife will be having ceaseron delivery there is no chance of normal but in this whole world Geetha Ma'am came as only hope for us. She told us if we are mentally prepared for normal delivery then we can do normal delivery.\u00a0\u00a0She induced my wife at 38 weeks, and as she promised my wife delivered a healthy baby girl on 16th jan via normal delivery weight 3.6kgs. And my wife followed her instructions very strictly and my wife and baby are doing good. If you live in Bangalore and are expecting a baby please close your eyes and associate with Dr Geetha Nagarjuna. You can trust her 100%.Finding a doctor who cares is a blessing and Dr. Geetha mam falls under this category. A great doctor for vaginal delivery,\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Geetha nagarjuna, you are a great doctor but beyond that you are an amazing human being.-Thank You!",

We were thoroughly guided by her and she took utmost care of the mother and the baby throughout the duration. Dr Geetha has been god sent for us. she took utmost care of me and gave individual attention during my term.\u00a0\u00a0Even in times of covid, she was accessible at all hours and on non consultation days too. she goes beyond the call of duty as a doctor to ensure well being of her patients and thoroughly explains each step as you progress in your pregnancy. Any concerns if I have and call to her personal phone she would always answer all my calls, she never takes consultation fees for any phone consultations or any wats app video consultations. She will just refuse to accept the consultation fee. Hardly we find doctors like her these days.\u00a0\u00a0I could enjoy the full term and with her guidance, I Had a NORMAL DELIVERY only because of her support and guidance. We are blessed with a baby boy weighing 3.8kgs and we\u2019ll always be thankful to mam. Though it is a big baby, She encouraged me for a natural delivery. All my family and friends thought I would land up in c- section because of weight of the baby. My family dint want to risk with normal delivery complications and asked doctor for C section. Doctor said she can still try for normal delivery though it is a big baby. She suggested various exercises and remedies to ease my discomfort and I was able to recover soon after delivery. She is one of the most polite and knowledgeable doctor in the city. She knows her patients well and ensures to make the journey easy. She is a delight to meet and consult. We strongly recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna. All the pregnant women are advised to consult her for their pregnancy journey. She is the best doctor in Bangalore and practicing in MOTHERHOOD HOSPITAL- BANASHANKARI. Thank you mam for everything.\u00a0\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0a",

She was very approachable. \nTo begin; my wife was getting checked in Cambridge Hospital near to my house. Visiting was twice in a month and scanning almost every visit; since there was no Cashless Insurance here I was looking for alternative. \nThen I was suggested this Dr. Geetha  and  I visited her from the end of 7th month of my wife pregnancy. *** **** *** ******* ************ ********* literally none scanning was done till delivery. \n\nDelivery day: My wife felt the water bag is breaking at 1:40 AM Monday; immediately I took her to Motherhood, Bsk. reached there at 1:50 AM, I just whats app ed a message to Dr. Geetha; saying she is admitted; that was about 2 AM. At 2:20 AM she replied that she has spoken to duty doctors.  I went back home to pick up essential item as was back in an hour. By the Dr, Geetha was in LDR, she said the delivery might happen any movement ; she also gave me a chance to witness the last few minutes of normal delivery at one corner side.\nI was moved and speechless when I saw the infant. This was my first experience though its my 2nd child. When she congratulated me; I could not even say Thankyou.\nI had to leave and wait outside the LDR; at bout 5 AM Dr. Geetha came out of LDR and said both are fine. Then I had voice and thanked her.\n\nPost Pregnancy and Hospitalization:\nShe visited every day evening enquiring health of my wife and giving necessary suggestions. All 3 days till discharge.\n\nThe doctors response; care; follow up is all extremely good. I would strongly suggest and recommend. I was suggested by my cousin who underwent delivery couple of years ago; hers too was a normal delivery. This way I visited her.\n\nHospital : Mohterhood Banagiri, Bengaluru opp; KIMS\nTo say  I was extremely satisfied with the Nurse and Care takers there.\nThey were doing their job wholeheartedly without any expectations from us. The care being given by them when every baby cries at night was superb. I felt they are like another mother there.\nOn discharge day when we offered some tips to the Nurse they refused.\nSuch is their commitment \n\nI am happy both with the Doctor and the Hospital",

She accepted me as her patient when I was towards the end of my first trimester, as I had to change my doctor. I was amazed in the first consultation itself by her depth of medical knowledge, quick diagnosis, and the treatment procedure. I had less amniotic fluid and she recognized the problem merely by hearing the noise during scan (no visual, only audio). She assured me of my baby\u2019s well-being, and after a few sessions of taking IV injections and fluid, combined with a daily oral solution, my amniotic fluid levels returned to normal. She even gave some of the solution sachets for free, and discouraged unnecessary consultation so that we do not spend more than what\u2019s necessary (in fact, she was very approachable on Whatsapp). My vomiting, weight, and blood sugar levels \u2013 everything improved under her treatment. She also encouraged me to do Yoga and prepare my body and mind for a normal delivery \u2013 she never suggests on unnecessary C-section. After a beautiful pregnancy, I gave birth (normal delivery) to a beautiful baby boy. Even after the delivery, she gave me attention and tips for my and baby\u2019s well-being. I simply cannot thank her enough! For anyone in search of the **** doctor under whose care they can enjoy their motherhood \u2013 I very strongly recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna. Currently she is with Motherhood Hospital Banashankari, and I wish her all the very best.",

After a bad experience with one of the most senior doctors ** ***** ***** we had to find another gynecologist for a second opinion, and Motherhood BSK was the closest hospital we could find, and luckily Dr. Geetha was there at that time. We instantly liked her approach to things and we decided on the same day that we should get the delivery done here. You may think she is not too old or experienced\u00a0to handle you or your baby, but trust me, if you already met her, you know what I'm talking about. Close your eyes and go with her, *** ** *** **** *** *** ******** **** And the usuals - always available, we could WhatsApp/call her anytime. *** ****** ******** ** ********** at certain times she even suggested taking home remedies to cure minor symptoms (not very common with doctors these days). In our 7th-month scan, we got to know that the umbilical\u00a0cord\u00a0had wrapped around the baby's neck a couple of times. We had to be very careful, monitor the baby's movements every 2 hours.\u00a0At the beginning of the 38th week, we noticed a sudden drop in the movements, we called Dr. Geetha and she asked us to get the scan done immediately, after which we found out that the movements and AFI had reduced a bit. She asked us to consider getting admitted\u00a0to the hospital ASAP to get the indued delivery done, as there are other complications and she didn't want to take the risk + the baby's growth was good too. Also, she put faith in us that even with these complications the normal delivery is possible and she would try her best, and then she did it!\u00a0\nI'm so glad everything worked out as planned and I can't imagine any other person than Dr. Geetha in that place at that time. She handled it so beautifully.",

                "review_text": "I have no words to thank her for the happiness I'm living in today with . I had to visit her last year since I was not able to conceive normally. As soon as she saw me she was very clear that I have cysts and that has to be cured to try to become pregnant. she treated me for the same for 3 months and then asked me to meet her. The scans were performed and ensured that there was nothing and we can try now. She explained the complete process of ovulation stimulation and gave me HCG shots but some how it got failed. I was very worried and troubled her asking what next.. But the quality I loved in her was her patience, since there was Corona pandemic she suggested me to try naturally for next 3 months and then she shall advice for next treatment and she did not hurry. This patience somewhere convinced me and I tried naturally. The very next month wonder worked!! I was pregnant and that feeling. I called her right away and she asked me to meet her on same day. She adviced me and guided me throughout the journey of my pregnancy. The qualities I love in her 1. Patience 2. Smiling 3. Availability any time - she provided her direct contact number and asked to call her any time even if we have any small doubt 4. Last and most importantly her guidance and support to get the normal vaginal delivery\nShe was so nice while explaining every small concept of pregnancy each month and making us mentally strong that normal delivery is not painful if we are strong! When I visited her for my 7th month scan I was diagnosed with cervical incompetence. She explained me about the scenarios that without cerclage the baby might come out early pre-term and she prepared me in 2 ways. 1. She provided me medications like progesterone harmone so that the baby will not be delivered early 2. She provided medication so that baby's lungs do mature faster so that there shall be no complications if at all if I deliver preterm. She was prepared and made me prepare for either of it. She put me on bed rest for my month 8. Even then at my 34th week my water broke and I gave her call and immediately she asked me to come to hospital. Throughout she did thorough scans and checks to ensure that baby is fine and I am fine and she did normal vaginal delivery. I don't think anyone shall take such risk when something like this happens at Week 34. She was so patient and quick to deliver my baby. I was induced around 11am and by god's grace delivered baby boy at 4 pm. She explained end to end of my pregnancy.\nI must mention my many thanks for all the support, risk she took and the care, love she renders and the encourament and explainatons she provides. She values money a lot. She does not unnecessarily ask us to do additional tests until unless they are really required.\nI am speechless for the dedication you have for your work and the love you show for your profession! hats off for that.\nThank you Dr. Geetha for all this. May the almighty bless you and your family with lot of happiness and abundance of joy and love.",

I feel very happy that I got an opportunity to express my gratitude towards Dr Geetha Nagarjuna. After a thorough research and feedback from dr.santhosh kumar(Pediatrician). we selected motherhood Hospital only because of dr.Geetha Nagarjuna who is known for normal deliveries until unless any complications arise during pregnancy. She is very cool and always have a smile on her face which makes us feel good.My  first delivery was C-section in my hometown ( Govt hospital) and I was thinking  and worrying about 2nd delivery also would be C-section. She accepted me as her patient when I was end of my 2nd trimester, as I had to change of my doctor. Dr .Geetha Maam explains everything so well and also guides us on every aspect of mom and baby care till delivery. Doctor was always Available and would take my call or would immediately reply back if anything was required. My due date was in 25th dec 2020. Dr Geetha said can't wait beyond 39- 40weeks in case of previous c section as I will have rupture uterus if I wait beyond. I have booked for repeat C section on 24th dec. On 21st dec, I started with slight back pain and pain in the lower abdomen. At 2pm went to Dr Geetha and she said I was 1cm dilated. Labour pain has just started. My baby had single loop of cord around the neck at the time of scan.After examination Dr Geetha said she will try normal if I'm progressing. I was surprised when Dr Geetha said that when I was all prepared for repeat c- section. Till 7pm I was only 3 cms dilated. Baby head wasn't coming down. Pain became very bad, I gave up and asked for c section. She gave me courage and extremely supportive, convinced me and my husband saying she will still try. She was there from beginning till the end of delivery continuously monitoring me and my baby. Finally at night 9:41pm baby girl was born with normal ( vacuum) delivery .In my case No doctor wouldn't have thought of giving trial for normal delivery taking so much of risks. Can't thank her enough ensuring the baby and mother is safe. Very young, energetic, professional, ************** **** *** ** ******* You truly make a difference in the medical field with your amazing skills.Those who want to go for vbac I can just say she will try her best. I can say with sincerity and utmost confidence that your in safe hands. I'm really grateful for all your support during this precious journey of pregnancy. Thank you so much mam.Strongly recommend Dr Geetha Nagarjuna to anyone who is expecting.",

                "review_text": "I had the best experience one can ever expect during uncertain times during the COVID 19 lockdown n pandemic. Our baby was born in June 2020 in Motherhood hospital- Banashankari and the days leading to the delivery were very stressful and with lot of uncertainty. Dr Geetha Nagarjuna was very humble and caring during such time.\n\n\n\nI Had PCOD issues, was under treatment for 3 months. And I conceived with ovulation induction medicines with her proper guidance and close monitoring.\n\nshe was very clear on do's and don'ts and explains the reason behind the symptoms during pregnancy. Rarely she prescribes any medicine other than for Calcium and Iron which is essential during pregnancy. Very patient doctor especially when you have lots of doubts. She has a lot of patience and never hurry things up. She knows in and out and much knowledgeable doctor.\n\n\n\nI came to know I had low lying placenta at 13 weeks. Dr Geetha suggested me take bed rest, no exercises, no travelling until the placenta moves up.\n\nUnfortunately I had severe bleeding at 25 weeks, me and my family thought I had an abortion. The way she gave me great confidence, comfort at that moment, can never forget in my life.\n\n\n\nShe can even predict what will be the test report. Her way of treatment, judgement, communication, confidence everything is too good.\n\nScan shows I had bleeding because of low lying placenta. Gods Grace everything was good in scan expect bleeding. I was admitted for a day and got discharged. \n\nDoctor always suggested to call her right away even at mid night in case of emergency. She was the first point of contact for any emergency. She always cares for her patients no matter what. Patients safety is her first priority. Finally my placenta moved up at 36 weeks. \n\n\n\nI started doing exercises after 36 weeks with her guidance. \n\nShe just insisted to do Pelvic/Kegel exercises ,Squats, butterfly, duck walking and sweeping/mopping floor in-order to stay active and healthy.\n\nDue to less pain tolerance and my short height with big baby everyone including me had an impression that I cannot withstand normal delivery.\n\n\n\nI was induced at 39 weeks because of big baby. I was in labor for 22 hours, requested Dr Geetha Nagarjuna to go for c section because of intense pain. She made me comfortable by giving epidural analgesia. I Had a \u201c NORMAL Delivery\u201d delivered baby boy weighing 3.74kgs. \n\nBut she put in all the efforts to make this delivery of mine normal. Her support , guidance and encouragement during labor was impeccable.\n\nShe waited till last moment and insisted on normal delivery though we gave up on our hope.\n\nI never knew that someone would fill that confidence in me which I never had, her smile and positivity will boost the confidence in anyone.\n\n\n\nMe and my family was really impressed the patience she has at this young age.\n\nWe came to know from my friends that Dr Geetha is very famous for normal deliveries and gives the best trial even during COVID times. She achieved the same in my case.\n\nSeems to keep the ethics of Doctor of providing quality service to people than being looking at bussiness perspective.\n\nMyself and my family members are very happy and we pray great success for her.\n\n\n\nBlindly go consult Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna without a second thought.Exceptional professionalism, personal care and guidance proves her very special and effective..Doctors like Dr Geetha Mam are truly rare.",

At that time I searched for a doctor that would try to go for normal delivery if there is even a small chance. While searching I found her and a lot of reviews regarding normal delivery and trust me, it is true!\nIn my case baby's position was not perfect. Although it was cephalic but baby still had to turn thrice for perfect position and other than that she had two loops of cord around her neck. I am sure if it would have been another doctor he or she might have suggested to go for C section.\nI had a friend in my yoga classes who delivered a baby girl on the same day as I did and she also had the same case of two loops of umbilical cord around her baby. However, her doctor suggested to go for a C section. Seems like I was lucky to choose the right doctor.\nFor any emergency or advice, she would always be there. Infact once I had late night emergency and she reached hospital before I could. Sadly, I am transferred to another city, otherwise I want her to be my doctor for 2nd time too.\nWould highly recommend her.",

I cannot put into words our gratitude for everything you have done for my family. I feel so blessed that I found your profile on practo. I realised I made right decision after my first consultation itself. My pregnancy journey was smooth without any complications and it was possible only with proper and timely guidance from you.I delivered baby boy vaginally within 7hrs after induction. My mom was treated for heavy menstrual bleeding and severe cramps. Dr geetha mam told it will be cured by doing D&C and mirena insertion, it worked like wonder. My mom is doing fine now.I can blindly recommend Dr geetha nagarjuna for pregnancy and gynec issues.*gives detailed explanation of issues*very very friendly *easily approachable on call/whatsapp ***** *** ********* *********** **************************gives an idea about upcoming symptoms *encourages all mothers to deliver vaginally(hard to find these days)*always smiling :)*lucky charmThanks a million. I miss you ma'am :(",

I never feel rushed, and she always asks if I have any other questions.\n\nShe is always friendly, thoughtful, and puts our concerns first. She explains how you & your baby are doing, position of your baby, your medical conditions, steps/exercises/diet to be followed for normal delivery right from the 1st scan.\n\nShe never calls for an unnecessary appointments or tests. Sometimes this could be expensive so that you can save a lots!\n\nAll my family/friends were shocked when I delivered a 3.6 kg baby girl with normal delivery. This could only be possible because I met Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna. From the Day 1, she guided me & preferred for normal delivery.\u00a0 We can blindly follow her instructions without any hesitation.\n\nI would like to say my heartfelt thanks and gratitude to Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna mam.",

We are blessed with baby boy on November 2021\u2026 it was very big and excited journey for both of us\u2026 as every journey consists of hard path we also diagnosed with complications\u2026 as we are in internet era we google everything \u2026 so many thoughts, negativity and pandemic also added it flavours\u2026 but Geetha mam never panics \u2026.she explains everything clearly with a smile. me and my wife will think of asking 100 questions but after meeting Geetha mam we jus feel positive and confident \u2026. She always tells my treatment is same for every patient \u2026 it\u2019s up to the moms how much they are concerned and put the efforts in terms of diet exercise and especially the dedication \u2026. That makes us realise we must trust our body and provide what is needed and ignore all other thoughts \u2026. All the messages and call over midnights everything mam answered ... I believe it\u2019s not only for us but for all of her patients \u2026. I really admire her dedication and service minded(which is lacking in most of doctors today)\u2026: I wish all the good health for Geetha mam\u2019s family who indirectly supporting her cause \u2026: thank you so much for your help and wishing you all the best madam",

Though she could have gone for laparoscopy. Doctor said she will remove uterus through vagina. She explained advantages of vaginal hysterectomy and have to say, the entire process went on very smooth. And my mother got discharged next day of the procedure. And never complained of pain after the procedure. She almost got back to normal within 3 days. Its almost 2months over, My mother was telling she never feels that she underwent a surgery. Surgery went very smooth. Thanks to Doctor, my mother is healthy and out of risk. She has a solution for almost everything. I would recommend her for any gynaecology problems. Thank you Doctor!",

My water bag broke around 5pm in the evening. I was never confident of delivering the baby \"normal\" , I was feeling really tired and felt it's not possible, due to which my entire energy got drained. She encouraged me so much that I could bear pain, I had no energy to push the baby out but Dr Geetha Nagarjuna gave me so much of confidence, she gave me courage at that moment really helped in pushing and the baby was finally \"out\", I was actually suprised at myself that I could finally do it and had a \u201cNormal Delivery\u201d.I can't thank her enough for motivating me to do it.Finally I would like to say the entire experince of my pregnancy and delivery went really smooth because of Dr Geetha Nagarjuna and ofcourse motherhood hospital- Banashankari.I strongly recommend Dr Geetha Nagarjuna.",

She is very knowledgable and most importantly has a lot of patience and makes you comfortable to discuss any issues. Her pleasant personality and the rejuvenating smile took away half of my nervousness. She is very humble and gives attention to each and every small things about your health. During my 7th month of pregnancy, scan shows baby growth is slow and less liquor.  I was very scared that this might affect the baby as well but she handled it with so much of personal care that I sailed it through smoothly. More of medicines she suggests home remedies.She gave me good protein diet plan and suggested me sachets to increase my liquor.  I delivered a baby boy at 38 weeks weighing about 2.8kgs. If u r with Dr Geetha Nagarjuna trust me you are in safest hand.Through out my pregnancy, she has been standing beside me like my guardian. I have got lot of gratitude towards her.She is very positive and happy person she gives same energy to her patients. Just follow what she advise and u will get the best.I strongly recommend her. In spite of so many complications in my pregnancy I delivered a very healthy baby. It was all possible because of Dr. Geetha NagarjunaThank you so much.. May God bless you.We highly recommend the doctor",

I was explained the complications if any with relevant details and how to handle the same.\n\nI was diagnosed with gestational diabetes later in my pregnancy. Dr.Geetha monitored the baby's growth and activities with due diligence given the complications of GDM. I was put on insulin (12U) per day to control the sugar levels. Liquor level was very less by the time I was in 36 weeks. Baby's heart beat and movements were monitored closely. \n\nWhen I went into labor, baby had passed motion at 3cms; still Dr. Geetha gave me normal delivery. Delivery process was very quick and was over in about an hour post getting admitted. Dr.Geetha took quick and dynamic decisions and gave me normal delivery. Post delivery, she has been very supportive and provided me with all the guidance required, be it to travel after 15 days of delivery, monitoring my blood sugars post delivery and diet to be followed. My baby was also monitored for sugar levels at regular intervals for 2 days. I am very happy and thankful to Dr.Geetha for all the support through out the journey. She was and is reachable on mobile for any queries and concerns through out the day.",

In the first consultation itself I felt she was friendly and takes patient care as a priority. This was my first pregnancy and she answered all my questions patiently, she was also available on phone at all times. There was a complication in 38th week of my pregnancy and she recommended to induce labor immediately. I was hospitalized at 10 A.M on 18th November and labor was induced by inserting gel. I was worried the complication would cause problem for my baby and requested for C-section around 12 P.M. But Dr. Geetha assured me baby's heartbeat will be monitored continuously, if baby is in distress she would go for C-section immediately and convinced me to try for normal delivery. Around 2 P.M I got intense pain and within 2 hours I delivered my son at  4 P.M . I believe I had short labor period because I followed all the exercises and lifestyle Dr. Geetha had recommended. I'm glad I found Dr. Geetha, she had the patience to try for normal delivery when I and my family asked her to do C-section. I don't think any other doctor would have given the same care so patiently. I would highly recommend Dr. Geetha to my friends and family.",

We were very happy, but then during my 14th week of scanning I came to know that I miss having cervical incompetence and the radiologist said if I went home from the scanning center there was no chance I like continue  my pregnancy, I was scared and spoke to my doctor but her reply was very negligent, somehow my husband managed to convince  her and get the cervical stitch done. Later I was told complete bedrest, my mom and my husband  met Dr Geetha Nagarjuna then. *** *** * **** *************  ******  she explained  each and everything  to them that's that's when we got the confidence and continued to follow her instructions. To be frank I was very scared.  I was not sure that I will complete my gestation period.  It is only because of Geetha ma'am  m holding my baby in my arms today. She was very supportive, her guidance and treatment fetched fruits for me and I had a normal delivery. I am very thankful to her.  I will remember her for the rest of my life. May God give her good health to serve the mankind. Thank you so so much Geetha ma'am. ",

I would first like to extend my sincere gratitude and appreciation to Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna for her constant support in helping me have a safe and normal delivery. We have been consulting Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna for PCOD, then she conceived naturally with her guidance and timely follicular monitoring. Dr Geetha Mam came as an angel to our life.\n\nFrom the very first month of my pregnancy. My wife and I always dreamt of delivering our child normally and our dream came true only because of this wonderful doctor who worked miracles for us. \n\n\n\nI had an issue with my water levels from the beginning of my 7th month and was able to go till the end of the month only with Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna continuous monitoring and treatment. She encouraged us to stay positive at every phase and ensured that we smoothly sailed through the last month till delivery. \n\nMy  wife AFI was 8cms she induced her, she was in labor for about 24 hours, baby had passed motion in the womb, We thought she would go with c- section, \n\nThe way she gave us confidence at that point, changed everything.\n\nTaking so much of risk and my wife had a vacuum ( NORMAL) delivery weighing about 3.54kgs. No Doctor would'nt have taken so much of risk. My Baby was all fine, there was no requirement of NICU care.\n\nI am not quite sure if there are many doctors today who would really go the extra mile, while it might just be simple to do a c-section.\n\nShe maintained transparency and educated us about every course of treatment. Her patience and dedication towards her patients and profession is commendable. A doctor who is so passionate towards her profession is hard to find and I'm really grateful to our friends who recommended Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna to us.\n\nWe are forever indebted to her for her selfless service. Thank you doctor for being a blessing in disguise and an advocate of God in bringing our bundle of joy to this world.",

We were expecting our first child after 5 abortions, we went through the anxious moments in the last few weeks before delivery, as any expecting couple would. At such moments, Geetha Madam's words were soothing, her observations were steely and the occasional one liners were just perfect for us - nothing more, nothing less.\n\nI am very fortunate that I got in touch with Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna for my pregnancy and delivery. I really thank the person who recommended her to me, and I recommend her to everyone now. \nThe moment I met her I knew I wouldn't want to consult anyone else other than her.\n\nYou can trust her judgement 100%! I am not a person who is easily impressed with someone but this woman is a wonder! Golden hands is what they call her and rightly so!! \n\nShe is very systematic in her approach and explains everything very clearly. We always came back with a positive feeling after interacting with her. \nEveryday my wife was taking injection Enoxaparin for my recurrent pregnancy loss. This time fortunately I could carry my pregnancy tilll 38 weeks.\n\nWe were planning to go for c- section. We dint want to have any complications with this pregnancy. \nShe encouraged my wife with exercises and gave me confidence that my can have a normal delivery by doing internal check at 38 weeks.\n\nThe day I got admitted, she induced my wife to get pains. She was in labour for 12 hours. she took epidural. She had absolutely no pain after epidural.\n\nSome of the reasons I was this impressed was her quick decision making ability in the labor room and she does it with such ease and confidence, her wonderful team of nurses.\n\nAnd to round it all up I almost gave up the last minute for a normal delivery but she did not give up and made sure I did it, and all I am is thankful and greatfull to this woman, hats off to you Doctor!! Never thought I will have Normal Delivery after 5 abortions.\n\nTo all women out there looking for a doctor who they can trust with their baby and themselves!!\nhow hard she works day and night.. this is to name a few!!!                        \n\nIn this beautiful world, there are many people performing their duty to the best of their ability and who can put a hand on their heart and say, yes Dr Geetha mam did the best. \n\nIf you are consulting with Geetha mam, we can say with sincerity and utmost confidence that you are in safe hands.",

She is extremely friendly and professional, making me feel comfortable and at ease throughout my visits. Right from the first appointment, she took the time to explain the importance of maintaining a healthy diet and incorporating exercise during pregnancy. Dr. Nagarjuna genuinely cares about her patients and their well-being, providing only necessary medications and avoiding unnecessary treatments. Her unwavering support throughout the entire journey, from conception to delivery, was exceptional. Thanks to her expertise and efforts, I successfully had a normal delivery. I truly appreciate her dedication in striving for the best possible outcome. Even after delivery, I still miss those regular visits to her office. I highly recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna to anyone in search of a friendly, caring, and competent gynaecologist.",

She was very warm, responsive and supportive at each stage and promised me a normal delivery and advised all the do's and don'ts for a healthy pregnancy and labor experience. It was a full term normal delivery like she had assured. Thank you, Dr. Gita and team for making my labor experience a beautiful one.",

She is very approachable & directly available on calls and whatsapp for all patient queries/concerns 24x7 and given her hectic schedule, you will be surprised at the super quick responses you get each time from her.  \nEven though our baby was on heavier side, she was confident I can have a normal delivery. Her confidence filled us with confidence each time we spoke to her. I was very particular about having normal delivery and inspite of few complications mam made sure I delivered a healthy 4 kg boy normally.

She made this journey very smoother and risk free, with God's grace and Mam's expertise it was normal delivery. I was 39 weeks pregnant when I got admitted to MotherHood. My delivery pain duration was too long but still she \u200bmanaged normal delivery. When my husband was waiting outside the labor ward, the cleaning staff asked him who the doctor is, when he said Geeta mam, they were assuring him of normal delivery and said, Geeta mam almost all the time does a normal delivery. I already recommend Geeta mam for my friends and family members and strongly recommend her for all of those who are reading this",

We realized that, we are in the safe hands later. Had a normal veginal delivery without any issues as we hoped for. Couldnt thank enough to Dr. Geetha for bringing smiles to our lives.

Finaly we got admitted to hospital for delivery due to low level of AFI, with all hard work of Dr Gheetha Nagarjun and their team we had normal and safe delivery. We are really happy for her friendliness, patience and confident. I can refer for any patient who is looking for normal delivery she will really help you out. ",

I tried couple of months but was not successful. \n\nThen my sister in law referred me to Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna for my second pregnancy planning.  \n\nMy first visit, she gave me that comfort and confidence. She cleared all my doubts and was spot on with identifying my problem area. With her help and minor corrections, I was successful in conceiving.  \n\nI am now consulting her in my pregnancy journey and she continues to bring in positivity and confidence at every visit I make. Her level of patience is unmatchable! \n\nThe very plus point of hers is that she is available when in need. \n\nI really can\u2019t thank her enough for all her support and guidance. It is an absolute blessing to have a doctor like her by our side.\n\nI strongly recommend Dr. Geetha Nagarjuna. *** ** *** ****** ************* * *****",

Since then from my 2nd month I followed up with her. The only thing I did is trusted her throughout my pregnancy. I did whatever she suggested for me. And finally I ended up with fruitful experience of my pregnancy with the doctor. The result is I had a normal delivery last week. Dr. Geetha is friendly, professional, calm and very clear on what she is doing. She was reachable on call for any emergency. I and my husband are thankful to Dr. Geetha for her care and support throughout my pregnancy. I strongly recommend Dr.Geetha for the smooth and safe delivery as she always prefers a Normal delivery for all of her patients.",

To be frank, I was not at all happy to meet her thinking she is not the right one for me. But the thought of testing her approach towards 8 months pregnant forced me to be positive. After coming out of her cabin, my stress levels were completely down and I was very happy about my decision to meet her.\nToday, we both are more than like family members and I keep calling her for casual talks and for any queries about my health.",

Although doctors in our family suggested their friend gynaecologists, we decided to go ahead with Dr Geetha just after 2 visits. She is that reassuring. At every appointment she guided us appropriately for a healthy pregnancy. She assured us that we could contact her for any kind of queries without hesitation. She guided us well with exercises, diet, travel. During a scare at 30 weeks I called her late in the evening, she immediately called me to the hospital and took care of it.\nShe induced me in the 40th week due to nuchal cord and helped deliver a healthy baby through normal delivery. We are forever grateful to Dr Geeta for all the guidance and decisions. One should always listen and trust their doctors especially for such time sensitive procedures. I highly recommend Dr Geetha for pregnancy care.",

My pregnancy  journey - I was happy with my  pregnancy result but at the same I was shocked and scared with my scan report as I had subserosal fibroid which I never knew in any of my previous scan reports and checkup. I had visited couple of docs for my pregnancy confirmation , their opinions( miscarriage , preterm labour , painful , hormonal injections) led me to confused disappointed state on continuing my pregnancy . We visited motherhood and met Geetha I really liked the way she explained to us - she was direct and told us it is totally normal and safe to continue with no fear and worries which gave us the hope and confidence . She never prescribed any hormonal injections and not too many unnecessary medicine nor any kind of special treatment for my fibroid.  She makes sure she responds to  messages and calls when in need which is very much a plus . To end this She helped me with smooth quick normal vaginal delivery and was blessed with healthy baby completing my full term Thanks to her and the team .",

I was consulting another doctor in the beginning who wasn\u2019t that informative and in 28th week I got AFI issue wherein my water level I.e, AFI was in the border line which was at high risk. My old doctor suggested to take few medications and if it doesn\u2019t work then we have to end up taking baby outside as soon as possible we don\u2019t have any other choice. That day was nightmare and wasn\u2019t knowing what to do and was in dilemmatic situation. Later my friend suggested Doctor Geetha Nagarjuna and when I met doctor Geetha, she explained the importance of AFI and how to overcome from this situation. She gave her 100% and helped me a lot with this AFI and took care of me to her level best. Completely followed Geetha\u2019s medications and treatment and I pushed from 28th to 35th week and in 36th AFI level dropped due to my placenta condition AFI didn\u2019t increase and with Geetha\u2019s advise I had undergone with c section and blessed with beautiful baby. It\u2019s truly a blessing that I met doctor Geetha. Her hands are truly magical\n and she\u2019s a fabulous and very friendly doctor and down to earth person as well. I strongly recommend each and every pregnant women to consult Geetha to have healthy and safe delivery \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0a",

We were impressed with the very first visit, the way she explained things and more importantly the nausea and sickness reduced the very next day and post a couple of days she did not vomit even once during rest of her pregnancy. Also my wife recovered so fast after her normal delivery. We were lucky we found her in Motherhood hospitals- Banashankari. Doctor is available 24*7 for our questions and genuinely told us to .

One more important and proud feeling about the doctor is she made miracle at the last time, when it was very critical to my wife to bear the pain all were suggested to C Section is the last option, but she gave us hope and promised and final she did normal delivery. We all family members are very happy with motherhood hospitality and Dr. Geetha guidance and support.

I knew i was in right hands.\n\nIn every visit she went extra distance and shared lots of knowledge, what to expect in each stage of pregnancy drawing from her own preganacy experience. I was encouraged to get in touch with her on her personal phone number as well outside of consulting hours. I relied and followed her advice on diet, yoga, medicines, suppements and scans etc.\n\nShe didnt miss a single face to face appointment even during the peak of the 2nd wave of Corona. And in the month of June she helped me deliver a baby girl and it was a normal delivery. Dr Geetha was one reassuring thing for me in midst of all the craziness around coz of the pandemic. I cant thank and recommend her enough.",
