"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"It is my pleasure to give the review about Dr. Shashikala Hande. I was in touch with her throughout my wife’s pregnancy and delivery. She is very friendly and explains everything whether she is introducing any medicine or why any new test needed to be done or any further step needed to be taken.

My wife is an IT professional. So, my wife was looking for normal vaginal delivery as other types of delivery like caesarean or forceps delivery is coming with different types of complications. I and my wife were not confident about the normal delivery, but Dr. Shashikala has given confidence to us that if no other complication happen during the later time of pregnancy like baby position or health issues then my wife can go for normal delivery.

The day my wife admitted in hospital she was asking for caesarean delivery, but Dr. Shashikala encouraged my wife and though normal delivery is painful, but my wife was able to do it.
I really appreciate Dr. Shashikala’s knowledge and experience regarding this matter.

Now I and my wife has been blessed by a baby boy where all people Dr. Shashikala, other doctors and nurse’s effort, involvement and blessings associated.

Thank you, Dr. Shashikala, for helping my wife to enter to Motherhood and me to Fatherhood phase of life. I highly and happily recommend Dr. Shashikala to the would-be parents for their parenthood journey.

Visited her for the 1st time, just a week before my 1st delivery. 2nd visit was on the day of delivery. Though she didn't know much abt my case, she treated me well and delivered a healthy baby thru NVD. Then i consulted her regularly for my 2nd pregnancy. On the day of delivery,I rushed into hospital arnd 7 AM with strong contractions and 7 cms dilated. She reached hospital in a very short notice (30 mins to be precise).

I delivered a healthy baby within 45 mins while my husband was still carrying out the admission formalities.
