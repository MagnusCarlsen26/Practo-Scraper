"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,Fertilisation In Vitro - Embryo Transfer (IVF - ET),",0,0,YES,"After consulting multiple gynec over 1.5 years and failing to get a clear direction on treatment course, we started visiting Dr. Anitha in 2017.
On 21st October we were blessed with a full term baby girl through IVF FET.

Our journey over past 4 years has been full of ups and downs which involved multiple pre and post pregnancy complications like PCOD, Ovarian Cyst, Short Cervix, 6 month abortion, Low fluid levels, Pre term contractions etc.
There were moments in 2018 where we almost gave up and were exploring surrogacy options but a Central revised law in this respect blocked this avenue too.
That being said, there was never a moment where Dr. Anitha lost hope in us and was our pillar of strength (apart from our parents) and beacon throughout with her structured and logical treatment plan.
Starting from medication to ovarian drilling to IUI and IVF (ET & 2 FET's) & embryo freezing - we always had clarity on course of treatment and immense trust on Dr. Anitha & team.
Not even once did we feel the need for a second opinion and Femiint was always equipped to handle all our complications in utmost professional and qualified manner.

We can never thank Dr. Anitha and her team enough for helping us with Anika's birth and she will always be her God Mother.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Ovarian Polyps,Irregular Periods,",0,0,YES,"Being a new mom , I was scared when I was diagnosed with Polyps. Doctor very calmly explained me , there is no particular reason to this. But it can be cured with a minor surgery. But unlike other doctors she didn’t right away ask me for surgery. She asked me to wait for a month or two , since polyps get washed away in their own with the menstrual flow. I waited for 2-3 months but the problems increased. When I decided for the surgery, my kid was just 2yrs old and I didn’t wanna stay away from him. Doctor took care of this concern of mine and discharged me in the evening. She is very calm and you can talk to her about every gynaec issue. I am happy to have found her !",2024-01-05 04:13:17,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
