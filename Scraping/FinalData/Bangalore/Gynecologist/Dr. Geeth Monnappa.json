Her excellent description, treatment and maturity gave me confidence and I was able to smoothly sail through all complications and anxieties during the tough times.\nShe has been a Friend, Philosopher & Guide throughout my journey of getting pregnant to the date i delivered a baby boy and thereafter also. I recall an incident which shows the kind of relationship she has with her patient. An hour before i went for labor, my husband's covid test report came out as positive. Dr Geeth handled the entire situation all by herself. Me including other hospital staff were awe struck with her kind, mature and brave act of putting on mask, gloves, face shield and PPE Kit & coming back with consent form signed by my husband. Her presence and comforting words helped me stay calm during the time when it really mattered. She also ensured that, Hospital took proper care of me and my baby post delivery in absence of attendant for next 2 days. May God bless her & her family. ",

I felt that I was in safe hands of a specialist doctor.\n\nI would like to thank Dr. Geet monnappa for giving me great relief from my physical as well as mental stress associated with all women. \nPost operation has been a psinfree quick recovery and i am in better health now. \n\nThank you so much doctor for all the experiences which I remember through out my life time.\n",

I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better doctor. I requested that I wanted to experience normal delivery if possible without epidural as well. And more than me, she ensured I tried my best and pushed towards normal to consider my request. In fact I begged her to perform caesarean or give me epidural during my delivery, but she kept encouraging me to try, constantly telling everything is good so far and I can and should keep trying. My family and I am so impressed with her that I am suggesting her to everyone I know. From ensuring I eat healthy  and gain only as much required weight to a healthy delivery and post natal care, she has been the best!! She is now my go-to gynaec doctor! I strongly recommend her for all things gynaecology. She is extremely patient, kind and considers your request. I have had bad experiences with other doctors who were self centered. But not once did I feel that way about Dr Geeth. Thank you so much Dr for all that you did and continue to do!",

We could discuss the smallest doubts we had and Geeth would answer all questions with a smile. \nShe guided us in all steps from the very first appointment to facilitating all the required details till we were in the labor room. We really felt the care when she would reach out to us to just check on how things are going with the pregnancy.\nOn 25th August 2021 we were proud parents to a very healthy baby and the doctor had been part of the complete journey with us.\n\nThank you Doctor.",

After so many miscarriages and was thinking to go for test tube baby suggested by another doctor with all reports normal, we were frustrated and upset. Fortunately my wife friend suggested to reach out Dr.Geeth and in first consultation itself I listened all positive things to push us mentally and  physically to get conceived naturally which I literally wanted as all reports were normal.  Then she did her own analysis and case study with couple of tests what to be considered and what to be ruled out to go for treatment. My wife got convinced with minimal medication naturally soon after meeting Dr.Geeth but sustaining the pregnancy was the actual problem for which she suggested the tablets and injections and got succeeded finishing 9 months without a single problem with her periodic checkups with personal follow-ups even if we forget the things to update her timely.Finally Doctor did a normal delivery in Fortis La Femme, so called corporate hospital :) ..** *** ******** *** ** *** ** *** **** ******* ** **** **** She is more than a doctor, a friend, care taker, mentor and teacher....Thank you Doctor for all your support and its immeasurable!!",

                "review_text": "** ***** ** ******* *** ***** *** ** *** **** ************ ** ********** She is very friendly and approachable and i know her since 2019.\nShe will listen to all the queries patiently (won't mind if you repeat the questions) and advise accordingly. Her excellent description, treatment and maturity gave me confidence and I was able to smoothly sail through all complications and anxieties during the tough times.\nShe has been a Friend, Philosopher & Guide throughout my journey of getting pregnant to the date i delivered a baby boy and thereafter also. I recall an incident which shows the kind of relationship she has with her patient. An hour before i went for labor, my husband's covid test report came out as positive. Dr Geeth handled the entire situation all by herself. Me including other hospital staff were awe struck with her kind, mature and brave act of putting on mask, gloves, face shield and PPE Kit & coming back with consent form signed by my husband. Her presence and comforting words helped me stay calm during the time when it really mattered. She also ensured that, Hospital took proper care of me and my baby post delivery in absence of attendant for next 2 days. May God bless her & her family. ",

I felt that I was in safe hands of a specialist doctor.\n\nI would like to thank Dr. Geet monnappa for giving me great relief from my physical as well as mental stress associated with all women. \nPost operation has been a psinfree quick recovery and i am in better health now. \n\nThank you so much doctor for all the experiences which I remember through out my life time.\n",

I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better doctor. I requested that I wanted to experience normal delivery if possible without epidural as well. And more than me, she ensured I tried my best and pushed towards normal to consider my request. In fact I begged her to perform caesarean or give me epidural during my delivery, but she kept encouraging me to try, constantly telling everything is good so far and I can and should keep trying. My family and I am so impressed with her that I am suggesting her to everyone I know. From ensuring I eat healthy  and gain only as much required weight to a healthy delivery and post natal care, she has been the best!! She is now my go-to gynaec doctor! I strongly recommend her for all things gynaecology. She is extremely patient, kind and considers your request. I have had bad experiences with other doctors who were self centered. But not once did I feel that way about Dr Geeth. Thank you so much Dr for all that you did and continue to do!",

We could discuss the smallest doubts we had and Geeth would answer all questions with a smile. \nShe guided us in all steps from the very first appointment to facilitating all the required details till we were in the labor room. We really felt the care when she would reach out to us to just check on how things are going with the pregnancy.\nOn 25th August 2021 we were proud parents to a very healthy baby and the doctor had been part of the complete journey with us.\n\nThank you Doctor.",

After so many miscarriages and was thinking to go for test tube baby suggested by another doctor with all reports normal, we were frustrated and upset. Fortunately my wife friend suggested to reach out Dr.Geeth and in first consultation itself I listened all positive things to push us mentally and  physically to get conceived naturally which I literally wanted as all reports were normal.  Then she did her own analysis and case study with couple of tests what to be considered and what to be ruled out to go for treatment. My wife got convinced with minimal medication naturally soon after meeting Dr.Geeth but sustaining the pregnancy was the actual problem for which she suggested the tablets and injections and got succeeded finishing 9 months without a single problem with her periodic checkups with personal follow-ups even if we forget the things to update her timely.Finally Doctor did a normal delivery in Fortis La Femme, so called corporate hospital :) ..** *** ******** *** ** *** ** *** **** ******* ** **** **** She is more than a doctor, a friend, care taker, mentor and teacher....Thank you Doctor for all your support and its immeasurable!!",

When I had a issue after the treatment when I called up her and enquiring, she told me that she has an another patient does that mean I'm not a patient anymore. Very much disturbing and unsatisfied. Please be in a situation of patient and react accordingly and provide extra knowledge to the patients before patient has a query. Emergency ward one sister was so helpful and kind too. Receptionist in the first floor was very arrogant in handling a painful patient. This is just to improve the satisfaction of other patients definitely not intended to hurt anybody's feelings. My husband wasn't contacted by the doctors and informed my situation from day one and only after the abortion he was called.",
