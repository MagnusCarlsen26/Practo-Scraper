"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"It's very fortunate that I consulted Dr Sireesha Reddy during my pregnancy and for the delivery in mother hood hebbal. She is too passionate about her work and gives  attention to every patient she sees which is what is required for any patient. Also she is available at any time , and responds prompt to query anytime to her patients through email or mobile.
Dr Sireesha Reddy, she is one such doctor  who insist on normal delivery who are really hard to find these days.
I really have to tell this:
During my labor in the last few minutes I was never confident of delivering the baby ""normal"" , I was feeling really tired and felt it's not possible as the entire labour and pain took for 15 hours long 
, due to which my  entire energy got drained and I had no energy to push the baby out but the minute Dr Sireesha Reddy arrived , the confidence she gave me at that moment really helped in pushing and the baby was finally ""out"", I was actually suprised at myself that I  could finally do it.I can't thank her enough for motivating me to do it.
Finally I would  like to say the entire experince of my pregnancy and delivery went really smooth because of Dr Sireesha Reddy and ofcourse motherhood hebbal.
I strongly recommend Dr Sireesha Reddy, *** ** *** **** ***** ** *** * **** **** *******
