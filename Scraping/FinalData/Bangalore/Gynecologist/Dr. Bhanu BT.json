Based on the feedback in practo, our conversation with her, care taking nature and data of practo such as her super strong recommendation, reviews ( count and recency) we chose her for pregnancy. I can say now that the decision to consult her was extremely right.  \n\nMy feedback on her care is; she raises in her customer obsession, **************** and capability in taking right judgement. We have seen at least 8 gynaecologist in Gujarat,  Bangalore (Marathahalli and Rajajinagar suburbs) *** *** ** *** *****\n\nWe always have consulted at her own clinic rather the hospitals she visits. Timings are very comfortable. We got very good personalized experience over there. Unlike big hospitals, you can save a lot of time and struggle to find the places and dealing with queues ( I got fed up previously). Also the place is in proximity of diagnostic labs and imaging centers. Her consultation charges are quite reasonable and worth of each penny. I found her highly professional and  prescribe right and only required medication and scans.\n\nActually we took her advice for second kid on prepragnancy. She always provided us sufficient time. Takes notes, listen well and answers all queries. Provides adequate time for case descriptions and checkup. Handle patient awesomely with both positive and negative motivation at the right time. Have some patience and you can see the best judgement and command over the advises and consultation. She strictly follows ethics and taken right trade off considering risks and suggested vaginal or c-section for delivery. I would strongly suggest you to save brain and just follow what she says. \n\nToday my wife successfully delivered the baby at late night (at 11.35). Delivery was super smooth. Post delivery, she didn\u2019t rush to go home despite of late night. She did post operating checks. She also had a check over baby and if that gets mother\u2019s feeding or not etc. This is exceptional and give you trust on having your wife and baby in right hand. \n\nI would also like to thank Practo for super reliable platform for finding such doctors. If practo allows, will have an update after a week with more details. Till the date, I am 200% satisfied and strongly recommended to consult her without any dilemma.",

She provided us the best care and attention throughout my pregnancy.\n\nFrom the day 1 of my visit with her, I never felt talking to a stranger. The doctor is very friendly, kind, caring, has lots of patience, listens to all your silly questions and answers all of them in the way you can understand. She prescribes right things at the right time. No unnecessary scans; no unnecessary blood tests. At the same time, never missed any necessary scans or tests. She has done the best that my baby and I need. I am very thankful to the Doctor for being very supportive throughout my journey of pregnancy.\n\nWhenever I get worried of some pregnancy symptoms, the doctor was always there to support and clarify what it is and why I have got. Every consultation with her was a very good experience, that when leaving her clinic, I come out very lighthearted. \n\nI was desperate to have normal delivery and Dr.Bhanu made my dream come true. From the time I got admitted in the hospital, the doctor was always there whenever required giving her personal attention. For every 2 hours, she was following up with the nursing staff even at the midnight. Next day, early in the morning, she was right there at the hospital to check on the progress. Every minute of my labor, doctor was there next to me, with her motivational words. She made me feel safe, cared for, and comfortable. \n\nThe confidence she gave me on the labor bed was phenominal. She spent more than 2 hours standing next to me in the labor room helping me deliver the baby safe. She guided me and helped me push the baby right. No words match to express my gratitude for the doctor. I enjoyed every moment of my labor and relish it now as well..  All this is because of Dr.Bhanu's supervision.\n\nEven post delivery, she gave time to check on the baby and mother's feed. She personally called me after couple of days to check on the baby's health and my health (I had postpartum edema - swollen legs) and suggested medications over the call. That is the care she has for her patients. \n\nThe Doctor is a cute little Angel in disguise with incredible ability and potential.\n\nWe are super satisfied with the doctor and very strongly recommend her :) ",

My pregnancy journey was so smooth, all thanks to her. We had so many worries and I remember my tension would disappear as soon as I visited her because she would always tell me \"Nothing to worry\". Throughout my pregnancy journey which was marked by severe nausea in the first trimester and a bathroom fall in the 2nd trimester, we consulted Dr Bhanu BT. *** *** **** ** ********* ******* listening to us with care, giving us support and appropriate advice/suggestions throughout. She has been always approachable, and has profound insights into pregnancy/fetus etc. and could guide us smoothly. We could reach her any time of the day and she would even reply to our silliest doubts. During the delivery which had to be C section, Dr Bhanu BT visited us many many times during the day of delivery, personally ensuring I was alright and provided care & support. We are more than happy and satisfied with her help, and would certainly go to her in case we plan for a second pregnancy in the future. She is definitely the doctor to go to and I would definitely recommend her to everyone!",

Dr Bhanu is very Friendly, follows very good professional ethics, cares for the patient, 2. Does not unnecessarily prescribe medicines,  and treatments , will suggest natural methods to concieve rather than costly treatments, if naturally we fail to concieve only then she would prescribe for the injections n medicationsshe would not also prescribe for unnecessary scans3. If patients do not turn up for the follow up, she cares to check on them if they are alright n doing good.4. initially one month clinic was closed due to Covid, but Dr was very propmt in replying or responding back to whatsapp messages and with the required prescriptions5. My BMI was on higher side as I was obese, with her guidance I could keep my weight gain to minimum throughout my pregnancy, 6. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during my pregnancy as early as 24th week, The care n the guidance what Dr Bhanu has given me none of the endocrinologist would have given me, I was monitored for my sugar levels every alternate days and in my follow up she used to check regularly n even if I miss any one day reading I used to get scared on how will I face her,because of her guidance towards end of my pregnancy my sugar levels came to normal values and my hba1c reduced from 6.1 to 5.6.At all stages,  my sugar levels, bp all parameters  including fetus growth were in normal and expected range.I would be thankful to her for all the guidance, care, and support what she has given me throughout my Pregnancy.Thank you so much Dr Bhanu \ud83d\ude4f ",

I never heard a doctor tell mr that this issue is not much of a worry. Dr. Bhanu has told me to lose weight. She also explained very clearly about how PCOS can be kept under watch by making certain life style changes.

Based on the feedback in practo, our conversation with her, care taking nature and data of practo such as her super strong recommendation, reviews ( count and recency) we chose her for pregnancy. I can say now that the decision to consult her was extremely right.  \n\nMy feedback on her care is; she raises in her customer obsession, **************** and capability in taking right judgement. We have seen at least 8 gynaecologist in Gujarat,  Bangalore (Marathahalli and Rajajinagar suburbs) *** *** ** *** *****\n\nWe always have consulted at her own clinic rather the hospitals she visits. Timings are very comfortable. We got very good personalized experience over there. Unlike big hospitals, you can save a lot of time and struggle to find the places and dealing with queues ( I got fed up previously). Also the place is in proximity of diagnostic labs and imaging centers. Her consultation charges are quite reasonable and worth of each penny. I found her highly professional and  prescribe right and only required medication and scans.\n\nActually we took her advice for second kid on prepragnancy. She always provided us sufficient time. Takes notes, listen well and answers all queries. Provides adequate time for case descriptions and checkup. Handle patient awesomely with both positive and negative motivation at the right time. Have some patience and you can see the best judgement and command over the advises and consultation. She strictly follows ethics and taken right trade off considering risks and suggested vaginal or c-section for delivery. I would strongly suggest you to save brain and just follow what she says. \n\nToday my wife successfully delivered the baby at late night (at 11.35). Delivery was super smooth. Post delivery, she didn\u2019t rush to go home despite of late night. She did post operating checks. She also had a check over baby and if that gets mother\u2019s feeding or not etc. This is exceptional and give you trust on having your wife and baby in right hand. \n\nI would also like to thank Practo for super reliable platform for finding such doctors. If practo allows, will have an update after a week with more details. Till the date, I am 200% satisfied and strongly recommended to consult her without any dilemma.",

She provided us the best care and attention throughout my pregnancy.\n\nFrom the day 1 of my visit with her, I never felt talking to a stranger. The doctor is very friendly, kind, caring, has lots of patience, listens to all your silly questions and answers all of them in the way you can understand. She prescribes right things at the right time. No unnecessary scans; no unnecessary blood tests. At the same time, never missed any necessary scans or tests. She has done the best that my baby and I need. I am very thankful to the Doctor for being very supportive throughout my journey of pregnancy.\n\nWhenever I get worried of some pregnancy symptoms, the doctor was always there to support and clarify what it is and why I have got. Every consultation with her was a very good experience, that when leaving her clinic, I come out very lighthearted. \n\nI was desperate to have normal delivery and Dr.Bhanu made my dream come true. From the time I got admitted in the hospital, the doctor was always there whenever required giving her personal attention. For every 2 hours, she was following up with the nursing staff even at the midnight. Next day, early in the morning, she was right there at the hospital to check on the progress. Every minute of my labor, doctor was there next to me, with her motivational words. She made me feel safe, cared for, and comfortable. \n\nThe confidence she gave me on the labor bed was phenominal. She spent more than 2 hours standing next to me in the labor room helping me deliver the baby safe. She guided me and helped me push the baby right. No words match to express my gratitude for the doctor. I enjoyed every moment of my labor and relish it now as well..  All this is because of Dr.Bhanu's supervision.\n\nEven post delivery, she gave time to check on the baby and mother's feed. She personally called me after couple of days to check on the baby's health and my health (I had postpartum edema - swollen legs) and suggested medications over the call. That is the care she has for her patients. \n\nThe Doctor is a cute little Angel in disguise with incredible ability and potential.\n\nWe are super satisfied with the doctor and very strongly recommend her :) ",

My pregnancy journey was so smooth, all thanks to her. We had so many worries and I remember my tension would disappear as soon as I visited her because she would always tell me \"Nothing to worry\". Throughout my pregnancy journey which was marked by severe nausea in the first trimester and a bathroom fall in the 2nd trimester, we consulted Dr Bhanu BT. *** *** **** ** ********* ******* listening to us with care, giving us support and appropriate advice/suggestions throughout. She has been always approachable, and has profound insights into pregnancy/fetus etc. and could guide us smoothly. We could reach her any time of the day and she would even reply to our silliest doubts. During the delivery which had to be C section, Dr Bhanu BT visited us many many times during the day of delivery, personally ensuring I was alright and provided care & support. We are more than happy and satisfied with her help, and would certainly go to her in case we plan for a second pregnancy in the future. She is definitely the doctor to go to and I would definitely recommend her to everyone!",

Dr Bhanu is very Friendly, follows very good professional ethics, cares for the patient, 2. Does not unnecessarily prescribe medicines,  and treatments , will suggest natural methods to concieve rather than costly treatments, if naturally we fail to concieve only then she would prescribe for the injections n medicationsshe would not also prescribe for unnecessary scans3. If patients do not turn up for the follow up, she cares to check on them if they are alright n doing good.4. initially one month clinic was closed due to Covid, but Dr was very propmt in replying or responding back to whatsapp messages and with the required prescriptions5. My BMI was on higher side as I was obese, with her guidance I could keep my weight gain to minimum throughout my pregnancy, 6. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes during my pregnancy as early as 24th week, The care n the guidance what Dr Bhanu has given me none of the endocrinologist would have given me, I was monitored for my sugar levels every alternate days and in my follow up she used to check regularly n even if I miss any one day reading I used to get scared on how will I face her,because of her guidance towards end of my pregnancy my sugar levels came to normal values and my hba1c reduced from 6.1 to 5.6.At all stages,  my sugar levels, bp all parameters  including fetus growth were in normal and expected range.I would be thankful to her for all the guidance, care, and support what she has given me throughout my Pregnancy.Thank you so much Dr Bhanu \ud83d\ude4f ",

I never heard a doctor tell mr that this issue is not much of a worry. Dr. Bhanu has told me to lose weight. She also explained very clearly about how PCOS can be kept under watch by making certain life style changes.

She only recommends necessary tests and procedures, no undue expenses and keeps things basic.

She suggests the sevices of diagnostic labs and imaging centres which are approachable and charge reasonably.

Timing was very convenient and even the receptionist was helpful. \nDuring my labour also she was just by my side and gave me positive vibes that I can do it. At some point I gave up saying I was tired but she was very supportive and finally I was able to deliver normally. All thanks to Dr Bhanu. If she was not there I wouldn't have done it. She is the epitome of patience and that is really appreciable. Am really glad that I found Dr Bhanu and I strongly recommend her  to anyone without any doubts.\nThank you Dr for all your support and care.\n",
