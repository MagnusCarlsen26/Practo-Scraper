I am incredibly grateful for my experience with Dr. Daksha. Throughout my pregnancy, she has shown unwavering kindness and professionalism, guiding me with the utmost care every step of the way.

Dr. Daksha's emphasis on natural delivery and her tailored approach to diet and exercise were particularly impressive. She addressed each issue methodically, always prioritizing the safety of both mother and baby. During labor, her constant support and encouragement for a natural delivery were invaluable.

Her friendly demeanor, exceptional patience, and genuine care made her a pillar of strength during my pregnancy. From critical concerns to seemingly trivial questions, she addressed everything with remarkable calmness. Dr. Daksha was my trusted companion from conception to delivery, providing the best possible treatment and support.

I feel truly blessed to have had Dr. Daksha as my doctor throughout this journey. Thankful for her unwavering care and expertise.",2024-06-27 09:07:16,False,True,Mehr Ahmed,,,

First I met Daksha ma'm for my irregular periods, then she diagnosed me with PCOS and thyroid issues but she did not jump into any medications straight away instead she explained all the science behind irregular periods and it's association with PCOS and thyroid. Then she suggested only life style changes like exercise and diet control.
After few months my periods became regular and thyroid was under control, then I conceived naturally twice but miscarriage happened both the times. 
Then my real struggle started with healthy conception and in this phase Daksha ma'm really helped me a lot to overcome all the emotional stress and she helped me to understand the reasons for miscarriage and then she started with very basic fertility treatments like ovulation induction, IUI, follicular growth study. After 4 months of basic fertility treatment I was able to conceive naturally and was able to deliver a healthy baby via natural vaginal delivery.. :)
I wrote this much lengthy review just to make anyone understand why they should consult and trust Daksha ma'm. My 3 years journey with Daksha ma'm was really amazing and I thank her for everything. Today I am holding my angel in my arms means, it's all because of Daksha ma'm help and effort.

I was suffering from it for last 4 years and it affected my mental health and my relationship drastically, to the point of no return. I visited multiple doctors and searched so much about the issue, there is not much awareness about this. I went through complete mental ordeal, lot of gynacs suggested that I need to consult therapist , sexologist etc, i tried doing everything but with no success. Then I came across Dr Daksha post reading reviews on Practo, calling her an angel is like an understatement. What she did was nothing less than a miracle. She gave me complete time and focus and taught me how to do dilator training, she helped me with the whole insertion process. I was in her clinic for about an hour, she patiently taught me and made me practice there itself. Within a week, I was able to insert the largest dilator. I just can't thank her enough for saving me. Dr Daksha please let me know if I can be of any help to you, would be willing to do whatever I can.
