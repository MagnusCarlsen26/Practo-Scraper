"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Meghna has been a blessing for us. It was in Sep 2020 when we first visited Dr. Meghna to consult for family planning after 1.5years of our wedding. She was very patient to hear out all our concerns and spent more than 30 minutes and addressed all our questions. Within 3 months’ time, I was able to conceive naturally where other doctors were suggesting some surgical treatments. Throughout the pregnancy journey, Dr. Meghna has been very approachable and gave all the required information for a healthy pregnancy. She was even responsive on the personal channel for any questions I had during the journey. Even during Covid times she was able to provide online video consultation and was willing to come to her clinic if required even for 1 patient.

She had remarkable expertise in operating for C-section in Rainbow Marathahali (I opted for C-section over normal delivery) and in Sep 2021 we had our healthy 3.2Kg baby with us :)

I would highly recommend everyone to consult Dr. Meghna for any Gynac / Obstetrician need.
