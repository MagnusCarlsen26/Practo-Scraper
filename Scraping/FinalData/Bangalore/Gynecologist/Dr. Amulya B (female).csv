,,0,0,YES,We have been consulting Dr. Amulya for past 7 months for pregnancy regular checkup. She is friendly with the patients and takes good care of the patients. She listens to our queries and answers them. Over all we have a good experience and would recommend her.,2024-06-02 05:09:07,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
,"Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,NO,"I called ovum to check for Gynaecologist availability at evening someone in reception told Dr.Amulya B is available repeatedly. Hence, checked reviews on her and nobody given any reviews to her. I’m Pregnant and it’s second baby which was tested at home. 
When we visit gynaecologist, they will first confirm about the pregnancy and then prescribe medicine and TT injection. But, Dr. Amulya didn’t even touched me nor tested to get confirmation about my pregnancy. Directly prescribed medicine and TT injection to take. And one comment what she said “ I feel your blood is good” not even 5minutes that consultation went. We waited for her of 30 to 35 minutes irrespective of appointment time. It was really disappointment for me. I suggest to check the reviews of doctor instead of their experience that doesn’t matter. ",2024-03-15 11:01:28,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
