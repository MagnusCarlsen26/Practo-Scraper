As a happy n satisfied patient I highly recommend Dr.Hira Mardi.",

I'm really glad that we got in touch with Dr. Hira.Mardi from the 1st day of my pregnancy and have been consulting her since last 9 months. This was my1st pregnancy and it was high risk as I had medical complications but because of Dr. Hira Mardi's treatments, availability, caring nature, guidance, and 24/7 availability made my high risk pregnancy very smooth. We wanted normal delivery, and Dr. Hira Mardi did everything in her hands to support my decision. Due to low hemoglobin and other medical complications we had to induce labour 2 weeks early for the safety of our baby. I was in labour for almost 30 hours and Dr. was always there checking on me. I couldn't bare the labour pain n had to switch to c-section.. The operation went really smooth.. we had our baby girl delivered at Cloudnine.  \n\nI highly recommend Dr. Hira Mardi for anyone who is looking for an amazing ObGyn for their pregnancy journey.\n\nWe Thank you Doctor from the bottom of our heart for always being there especially during this tough time of covid-19.  Thanks for advising us and explaining each and every minute details, reminding me the importance of having meds/exercise and keeping track of everything during regular checkups. Thank you for always being available and reminding us by texts and calls.\n  \nWe will always be grateful to you\ud83d\ude4f",

After our first meeting only, she made us speechless with her attitude and the way she took care of me.Dr. Hira listens all the complexation very carefully I was going through and answered all my questions with smiling. From the beginning she was planning for normal delivery for me even though I had C-section before 3 years back.She improved my health condition by suggesting good medicine and diets. I was feeling always nausea and doing too much vomiting during that period. But Dr. Hira suggested all the precautions.By time I was getting better and my health condition improved with her supervision. At the time when delivery date was near, she was regular taking care of me by checking my health condition. She asked me that I can contact her at any time (24/7) if there is any complexion. Even if she couldn\u2019t pick the call may be due to her busy schedule but immediate next to that she called me back.At the last month we came to know that my baby is in breech position. Even though she gives us hope to wait for last week, in case baby position may change. But it didn\u2019t happened for my case.Now when the date came for delivery, Dr. Hira provided option of some top hospital name where she visits. We choose Apollo Cradle. She did very well C-Section delivery.Finally, Alhumdulillah we blessed with baby girl. Masha Allah!!!.My experience with Dr. Hira Mardi was excellent and was good memory for us.I wish Dr. Hira to get more success and her career and her life and always be same how you have treated me. Thank you Dr. Hira!!.",

She didn't over-burden my wife with too much medications. Her clinic has a USG Facility, which was extremely helpful during Covid time, so we didn't have to roam around to other facilities or hospitals for USG. She is extremely nice person but at the same time very professional. Because of her, my wife went for Normal Delivery, and we are blessed with a healthy baby girl. She did all the procedures. Last but not the least, as being a very nice person, she has been doing a very good service. Her remuneration for consultations and for USG at her facilities are quite reasonable. Her assistants at the clinic were quite helpful.We are glad, we got in touch with Dr.Hira Mardi, as we would be forever thankful.",

An angel who showers her love sitting in \"Sushila Mathrutva Clinic\".\nInitially, when my husband and I met her she welcomed us with a warm wish for our new journey that we entered.Soon when our routine checkups started with her, she always made us feel homelike on our visits to her clinic.\nWe never felt as if we are meeting a professional doctor, and we are her patients or clients.She always treated us like a family with that personal touch to make us feel comfortable.Not even this but her clinic staff is also very good.\nWe are lucky and fortunate to have her as our doctor throughout this journey.\nDr. Mardi is full of life and down to earth as a doctor she has all warmth for her patients.Fortunately my journey of being a mother with her was very comfortable and I did not even realize when my 9 months passed.\nI wish her good health, wealth and success in her future endeavors.May she deliver many more babies ahead. As a happy n satisfied patient I highly recommend Dr.Hira Mardi.",

I'm really glad that we got in touch with Dr. Hira.Mardi from the 1st day of my pregnancy and have been consulting her since last 9 months. This was my1st pregnancy and it was high risk as I had medical complications but because of Dr. Hira Mardi's treatments, availability, caring nature, guidance, and 24/7 availability made my high risk pregnancy very smooth. We wanted normal delivery, and Dr. Hira Mardi did everything in her hands to support my decision. Due to low hemoglobin and other medical complications we had to induce labour 2 weeks early for the safety of our baby. I was in labour for almost 30 hours and Dr. was always there checking on me. I couldn't bare the labour pain n had to switch to c-section.. The operation went really smooth.. we had our baby girl delivered at Cloudnine.  \n\nI highly recommend Dr. Hira Mardi for anyone who is looking for an amazing ObGyn for their pregnancy journey.\n\nWe Thank you Doctor from the bottom of our heart for always being there especially during this tough time of covid-19.  Thanks for advising us and explaining each and every minute details, reminding me the importance of having meds/exercise and keeping track of everything during regular checkups. Thank you for always being available and reminding us by texts and calls.\n  \nWe will always be grateful to you\ud83d\ude4f",

So, we decided to go and meet with Dr. Hira once. After our first meeting only, she made us speechless with her attitude and the way she took care of me.Dr. Hira listens all the complexation very carefully I was going through and answered all my questions with smiling. From the beginning she was planning for normal delivery for me even though I had C-section before 3 years back.She improved my health condition by suggesting good medicine and diets. I was feeling always nausea and doing too much vomiting during that period. But Dr. Hira suggested all the precautions.By time I was getting better and my health condition improved with her supervision. At the time when delivery date was near, she was regular taking care of me by checking my health condition. She asked me that I can contact her at any time (24/7) if there is any complexion. Even if she couldn\u2019t pick the call may be due to her busy schedule but immediate next to that she called me back.At the last month we came to know that my baby is in breech position. Even though she gives us hope to wait for last week, in case baby position may change. But it didn\u2019t happened for my case.Now when the date came for delivery, Dr. Hira provided option of some top hospital name where she visits. We choose Apollo Cradle. She did very well C-Section delivery.Finally, Alhumdulillah we blessed with baby girl. Masha Allah!!!.My experience with Dr. Hira Mardi was excellent and was good memory for us.I wish Dr. Hira to get more success and her career and her life and always be same how you have treated me. Thank you Dr. Hira!!.",

She didn't over-burden my wife with too much medications. Her clinic has a USG Facility, which was extremely helpful during Covid time, so we didn't have to roam around to other facilities or hospitals for USG. She is extremely nice person but at the same time very professional. Because of her, my wife went for Normal Delivery, and we are blessed with a healthy baby girl. She did all the procedures. Last but not the least, as being a very nice person, she has been doing a very good service. Her remuneration for consultations and for USG at her facilities are quite reasonable. Her assistants at the clinic were quite helpful.We are glad, we got in touch with Dr.Hira Mardi, as we would be forever thankful.",

Right from initial pregnancy tests till final delivery and even beyond, Dr Hira was very supportive and used to take care. During pregnancy, BP was detected on the higher side. Dr. Hira used to personally follow up regularly to check the BP status. For delivery, she was very supportive and waited for long to try for normal delivery.\n\nWould highly recommend her for pregnancy related consultations and for delivery. Also considering all scans can be done right at her clinic is an added advantage. Charges are also lesser than big hospitals - a bonus.\n\nThank you Dr. Hira for your effort and support throughout pregnancy.",

She used to explain in detail and creates friendly environment in each and every visit.\nAs instructed by doctor I used to walk and do exercises due to which I got the contractions naturally in 38th week. Doctor tried for normal delivery for about 15 hours but since the baby passed mecconium we don\u2019t have time to wait for normal delivery. I had c section and delivered a healthy baby.\nOverall I would say it\u2019s a great experience with doctor Hira Mardi and I would highly recommend everyone to consult Hera mam to have a healthy and happy pregnancy journey.",

The moment we met the doctor we felt very comfortable and the doctor is very friendly, in simple words made our tension and stress go away and instilled confidence that I am there for you even in this covid19 pandemic situation.\nMy wife has a fibroid in her uterus, still the journey from first meting the doctor to the delivery of the baby went on very smoothly as doctor was available for us at just a phone call away. \nI was tensed as i dint have any relatives here, and due to pandemic was not able to call anyone here, how will I manage, but still due to doctors support and guidance all went well and I am blessed with a baby girl. \nWith Dr Hira Mardis reference we got the delivery done at Cloud9 and the experience was very good and pleasant.",

Right from the  beginning she is very down to earth.Being first time parents we have asked tons of questions and she has clarified very patiently all of them. Also, she has guided and helped my wife with normal delivery. I'm really grateful to her and the team for this wonderful experience. If you are also new parents and not sure which doctor to visit, I would recommend you try visiting Dr. Hira Mardi Ma'am and based on our personal experience, I'm certain you will not regret your decision.

But we expected that doctor would show more like facial parts and bone structures ( Our previous experience with different clinic and different doctor for NT scan was very fascinating.She showed lot of baby parts and bone structures. Pictures were also very clear unlike this). Final Report quality of the pictures also not that worthy of Rs. 2000.I hope they improve their infrastructure in future and little more baby scan show to (going to be)new parents.",
