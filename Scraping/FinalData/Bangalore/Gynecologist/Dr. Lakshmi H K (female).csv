We met Dr. Lakshmi for the abortion in the year 2021 as we the couples were not prepared mentally for the baby due to carrier. Once we spoked openly she was not agreed for abort but with her moral support she sent us back to make positive decision. With her moral talks, few examples the positive hopes was built in us and now 2.4 years old Son is live on this earth.
 The Doctor is really friendly and serving the peoples with good deeds.
