"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Wish I could just explain my experience with stars. I think I love everything about her. My previous doctor had put me down and I changed to her in my 9th month. I am so grateful I chose her. She took care of me how exactly I thought a doctor should be. Her love for her work and patients is so evident in the way she treats them. I am lucky that I chose her and my daughter had seen her first. She will always hold a  special place in my heart not only becoz she helped me delivered my baby but the way she took care of me after delivery. Even when my C-section scar opened up due to my negligence after six months, she told me nothing to worry. She gives me this amazing confidence and I am so glad that I can’t thank her enough.",2022-08-23 23:19:40,False,True,Kajolh,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I strongly recommend Dr. Chaya Patil.
