As soon as I entered she just smiled and started taking  about my diet and weight. I took appointment just bcz I am suffering from abdominal cramps,  headache and vaginal infection. She did not even asked my problem and when I am trying to explain her she's not in a mood to listen to me.  She doesn't examined me and where I am getting pain and no prescription not even at least one tablet or injection or an ointment. Without listening to me she told me to consult other Doctor Who is nutritionist. And that lady charged 1500 for test and consultant fee just to give me daily diet.  What I am supposed to do when am suffering with pain with your **** **** ******** *** diet. Total 2250 was charged for 2 hours without any treatment. I am writing review for the people who need to consult this doctor, please don't spend your valuable money and time here.",

My experience -  This is my 2nd pregnancy, based on my NT scan, she recommended going for a NIPT test and the report was negative. She told everything is fine, nothing to worry about. When I did my anomaly scan in the 20th week of pregnancy, some soft marker was still there, we were very worried and needed honest & clear counseling. Then she is telling us that NIPT doesn't make sense as the fetal fraction count is less and the baby has a chance of chromosomal abnormalities and we don't have any options now. She made us cry the whole night and was worried and stressed for 2 weeks. ** **** *** *** * * ***** ******* **** ******* ******* * *** ******** ******* **** **** *** **** ** ******** *** ******* ** ***** ****** *** **** ** **** *** ***** ** ** **** ** ** **** ***** *** ** *** ** ******* ***** **** **** ****** *** ******** **** **** ** *** ******* ***** ***** **** **** ********* *** **** ******* ** ******* ** ********** * *** ****** ** *** * **** ********* ****** *** *** **** *** *** ** ***** **** *** **** ******* * ******* **** **** This was our mistake and I would never want anyone to go through this experience.

As soon as I entered she just smiled and started taking  about my diet and weight. I took appointment just bcz I am suffering from abdominal cramps,  headache and vaginal infection. She did not even asked my problem and when I am trying to explain her she's not in a mood to listen to me.  She doesn't examined me and where I am getting pain and no prescription not even at least one tablet or injection or an ointment. Without listening to me she told me to consult other Doctor Who is nutritionist. And that lady charged 1500 for test and consultant fee just to give me daily diet.  What I am supposed to do when am suffering with pain with your **** **** ******** *** diet. Total 2250 was charged for 2 hours without any treatment. I am writing review for the people who need to consult this doctor, please don't spend your valuable money and time here.",

My experience -  This is my 2nd pregnancy, based on my NT scan, she recommended going for a NIPT test and the report was negative. She told everything is fine, nothing to worry about. When I did my anomaly scan in the 20th week of pregnancy, some soft marker was still there, we were very worried and needed honest & clear counseling. Then she is telling us that NIPT doesn't make sense as the fetal fraction count is less and the baby has a chance of chromosomal abnormalities and we don't have any options now. She made us cry the whole night and was worried and stressed for 2 weeks. ** **** *** *** * * ***** ******* **** ******* ******* * *** ******** ******* **** **** *** **** ** ******** *** ******* ** ***** ****** *** **** ** **** *** ***** ** ** **** ** ** **** ***** *** ** *** ** ******* ***** **** **** ****** *** ******** **** **** ** *** ******* ***** ***** **** **** ********* *** **** ******* ** ******* ** ********** * *** ****** ** *** * **** ********* ****** *** *** **** *** *** ** ***** **** *** **** ******* * ******* **** **** This was our mistake and I would never want anyone to go through this experience.
