There will be no apologies from staffs or doctor for being late. We needed to pay full consulting charges even for showing the reports or follow up.  If we ask any thing from the front end staffs , you will not get proper answers but doctor will question you why are you making problems. Medizone very poor in handling customer and we witnessed few cases in front of us. It is better to consult the doctor in her hospital rather than Medizone. ",

There will be no apologies from staffs or doctor for being late. We needed to pay full consulting charges even for showing the reports or follow up.  If we ask any thing from the front end staffs , you will not get proper answers but doctor will question you why are you making problems. Medizone very poor in handling customer and we witnessed few cases in front of us. It is better to consult the doctor in her hospital rather than Medizone. ",
