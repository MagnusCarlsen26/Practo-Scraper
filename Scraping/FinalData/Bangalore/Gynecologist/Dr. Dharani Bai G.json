I made a pre booking appointment at 6 30pm and reached there at 6 30pm and informed the receptionist and they told me to wait for 30 minutes. And I go back to check on the status and to my surprise they ask me what is the issue and what you have come for. Wonderful treatment they gave. \n\n2. After patiently explaining them the situation, 5 mins later the lady comes and asks me for an ID proof for patient and without it we cannot proceed further. Which we never carry everyday to prove our identity to everyone and nothing was mentioned during appointment call. And I told them after I reach home would send the details. \n\n3. This time I approach this * * * * * * * * **** doctor DHARANI just to clarify one of the doubts I had and she IS NOT READY TO LISTEN AND CLARIFY MY DOUBT and shuts the door on my face with my wife inside who has communication barrier despite my wife telling her the same. And in the end she gives me some report which I didn't understand and have been trying to ask that Lady for the same and she starts yelling on me insulting me and my wife telling me \"why should I explain it you\" One wonderful answer from a Doctor DHARANI. I did not utter a bad word at her considering her old age and she calls me S T U P I D in the end. And all these happened there from 6 30 pm to close to 9pm and doesn't let me out without paying which is want they wanted.  \n\n4. In the end I ask what's the point of booking an appointment and she says that is how they function. ******** **** ** *** **** ** ******* Strongly recommend DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. **** ** *** *** **** ***** ** ***** *** *** **** ***** ****** **** ",

I made a pre booking appointment at 6 30pm and reached there at 6 30pm and informed the receptionist and they told me to wait for 30 minutes. And I go back to check on the status and to my surprise they ask me what is the issue and what you have come for. Wonderful treatment they gave. \n\n2. After patiently explaining them the situation, 5 mins later the lady comes and asks me for an ID proof for patient and without it we cannot proceed further. Which we never carry everyday to prove our identity to everyone and nothing was mentioned during appointment call. And I told them after I reach home would send the details. \n\n3. This time I approach this * * * * * * * * **** doctor DHARANI just to clarify one of the doubts I had and she IS NOT READY TO LISTEN AND CLARIFY MY DOUBT and shuts the door on my face with my wife inside who has communication barrier despite my wife telling her the same. And in the end she gives me some report which I didn't understand and have been trying to ask that Lady for the same and she starts yelling on me insulting me and my wife telling me \"why should I explain it you\" One wonderful answer from a Doctor DHARANI. I did not utter a bad word at her considering her old age and she calls me S T U P I D in the end. And all these happened there from 6 30 pm to close to 9pm and doesn't let me out without paying which is want they wanted.  \n\n4. In the end I ask what's the point of booking an appointment and she says that is how they function. ******** **** ** *** **** ** ******* Strongly recommend DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. **** ** *** *** **** ***** ** ***** *** *** **** ***** ****** **** ",

I became pregnant in 2018 and I am very happy for my choice now..She is a very friendly doctor and listens to every concern patiently and finds the best solution for it. On her advice we delivered baby boy in Cloud Nine hospital. \nDharani is one of those gyno who I would blindly recommend to anyone in B'lore. You can just trust her as she is very friendly,also bcoz she scolds you like a Mom and treats you like a professional. :)\nThanks Dr. Dharani Mam for all the care you have shown till date. :)",

She never kept the time for my 4 appointments, more than 1 hour late always.. I noticed her attitude is same to everybody and once have seen a tiff with other patient's husband in front of me..again I dont see any bad feedback about her in any forums, but she deserves a lot bad feedbacks   ..  :)\r\nI had to search for an other doctor...\r\n\r\n",

She analyzed all health concerns in detail for both of us and provided appropriate treatment to conceive a baby in hardly second cycle of our visit. Her expertise in identifying different risk parameters in the lab reports, ultrasound and anomaly scan really helped us to cure problems at the earlier stage to avoid later complications.She never asked us to do any unnecessary tests or scans and always focused on health and safety of mother availing virtually or in person at Cloudnine.She advised my wife to get admission at hospital at the right time for the term delivery around 40 weeks and consistently stayed in touch at mid-night along with Cloudnine on-duty doctors to monitor mother and fetus health. She was present in person in the early morning for ensuring normal delivery and had encouraged mother during labour pain.I definitely recommend Dr. Dharani Bai G to all those couples who want a solid expertise, polite and attentive Obstetrics/Gynacologist doctor to be there as a mother at Cloudnine Whitefield.Thanks Dr. Dharani Bai G madam for gifting us a healthy baby with lifetime experience of happiness.",
