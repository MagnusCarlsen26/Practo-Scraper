"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I have been married for 7 years and did not conceive even once in these years. I consulted a Fertility centre Milan in JP nagar which gave us no results inspite of visiting for 3 long years. I was completely broke down mentally, physically and financially.. However, as a last hope we consulted  Dr Shwetha referred by one of our friends. I feel emotional and excited today as I am writing this review about Dr Shwetha , I felt confident in the first visit itself, each appointment was worth the visit and lead us to our dream of having a baby. Yes! I’m pregnant now, in such a short span it’s only 6 months I have been consulting.. Dr Shwetha has given me the most precious gift in my life, we are so fortunate to have connected with you Dr, you are much more than I ever  would have thought could find in a doctor, thank you for your medical, mental emotional, motivation, positive attitude  and spiritual support, you have made such a big difference in my  life I’m grateful to you. Any one trying to conceive and lost hope, trust me never lose your hope as you will never regret your decision of meeting Dr Shwetha. Its Blessings.I would also like to include about the staff members who are very supportive, friendly and always cooperative. A big Thank you to Dr Shwetha and all the staff members. :)",2021-01-15 08:49:39,False,True,Mousami,,,
"Value for money,","Gynae Problems,",0,0,NO,"I am writing to share my recent experience at Janisthaa Fertility Clinic, specifically with Dr. Shwetha and her staff. Unfortunately, my last visit Saturday was highly disappointing, as I found the approach of both the staff and the doctor to be severely lacking in customer-centricity and transparency.

Upon arrival, my wife and I were directed to a consultant downstairs, where we provided all relevant information about our situation. Subsequently, we were sent to Dr. Shwetha, who spent a mere minute discussing our concerns before referring us to her assistant for further assistance.

However, my dissatisfaction escalated when it came time for billing. Without consulting anyone else, the receptionist demanded a payment of 5000 rupees and handed us a bill labeled as an ""unwanted kit"" for the same amount. When I requested a breakdown of the charges, I was astonished to see various fees listed, including 600 rupees for the consultant, 500 rupees for scanning, 390 rupees for another consultant, and a staggering 3510 rupees for ""written doctor names."" When I questioned this, I was told it was a government fee, which seemed dubious at best.

Feeling misled and frustrated, * ******** **** **** * ** ** *** ****** ****** ** ****** * **** ************ *********** However, upon further discussion with Dr. Shwetha herself, I received no satisfactory explanation or resolution. Instead, all medications and prescriptions were abruptly taken back, and my wife and I were asked to leave.

It is deeply concerning that such practices are allowed to persist in a medical establishment. Patients have the right to transparent and fair billing practices, as well as respectful treatment from healthcare professionals. My experience has left me questioning the integrity and ethics of Janisthaa Fertility Clinic and its staff.*** **** ******* ****** ** ******** *** ******** **** *** ****** *** * ******* *** ****** ** ******* ** ***** ********* *** ******** *** ****** ** ***** ********* No one should be subjected to such treatment, regardless of their financial status.",2024-02-28 12:43:23,False,False,Ankur Singh,,,

"Wait time,",,0,0,YES,"The doctor was very professional but I felt like she was in a hurry. She didn't even gave me proper 5 mins for consultation. The pregnancy test came negative. She told me to get a thyroid test done. It came fine.
