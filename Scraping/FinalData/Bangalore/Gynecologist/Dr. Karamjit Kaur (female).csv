,,0,0,YES,"Visited her for both my pregnancies.
I have been to many gynaecs before but this doc is one of a kind... She is very patient, considerate and most importantly she listens to what you have to say.
She understands where our concerns are coming from and suggests accordingly.  Her ********* *** *** approach to towards patients , the way she treats them pre, during and post pregnancy are praise worthy.  She made my pregnancy very smooth and delivery much smoother.
