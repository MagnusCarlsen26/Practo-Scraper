,,0,0,Yes,"It was a good experience. We had some questions when we asked her to answer it. I have already recommended the doctor to others, she does give time for the consultation. We are happy to visit her for the consultation we wanted to know about the personal issue. It was just 5-10min of short consultation happy with that.

,,0,0,Yes,"*** ********* *** ***** Doctor behaviour was good and she listened to our problem very well. I took gynaecologist related treatment and I am satisfied with doctor treatment. I would like to recommend this doctor to others and I will give a rating of 8/10.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Urinary Tract Infection (Uti),",0,0,NO,"I had visited the doctor once. She had just prescribed medicines without explaining the problem. It was a quick sit up for which they had charged me 150. Also there was a long waiting line despite making online bookings and showing up way before time. 
After this they had asked me to revisit, just to said ok good. That's all. For which I had to repay the fee. ",2020-01-27 04:35:48,False,False,Karishma Shah,,,
