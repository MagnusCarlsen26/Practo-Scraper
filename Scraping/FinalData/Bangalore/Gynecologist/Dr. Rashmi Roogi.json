And one fine day, I discover this Angelic Doctor !\n\nWords fall short to describe her professionalism and sense of approach, truly one of a kind. She was patient enough to listen and understand my concerns and always helped to overcome them. No matter what the issue was, she was all ears. Rarely do we find such a  great Doctor !  \n\nWith such a great experience with her, I have been praising her among my family and friends so much so that even people in my hometown are familiar with her name.  We were truly impressed and amazed by her.  \n\nAll through this journey, she has been a  great support system, truly a gem.\n",
