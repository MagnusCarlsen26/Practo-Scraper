"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,I really don know where to start.. this doctor is amazing... I'm an obese 3 class woman and I visited this doc for my delivery.. my first pregnancy.. during all my visits.. she would just say that everything is fine... just be the same.. she never scared or talked about complications etc.. even during my delivery.. when everyone in my family was worried that I would have to go thru a C section.. she just told me that we should wait for a normal delivery... and indeed I had a normal delivery... a very friendly doctor.. amazing and does not scare u with any jargons and issues.. she always looks calm and is the best... I would rate her more than the best.. (if any category is available like that)if you are looking for a good gynaec and obsterician.. I think you can just go ahead with her.. don have 2 thoughts about it at all.. ,2020-08-06 06:05:56,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,Wait time,Treatment satisfaction,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,Irregular Periods,",0,0,NO,"I never post reviews online but my terrible experience with Dr Savitha is something I felt I was obligated to share. 

So I went to her for irregular periods. She gave me some tablets that helped but time spent in trying to explain what was actually going on with me was zero. In fact when I simply asked ""What exactly should I tell a dietitian if they ask me what my condition is"" rather than stating what was going on or taking the time out to explain things to me, she just brushed it off and said ""Show them your scan they will get it"". She has zero concern for trying to make the patient understand what is going on. Apart from this, time spent in general is extremely limited, looks like she's always in a hurry to get somewhere and she's doing us a favor? Terrible. My experience with her today broke the camels back which prompted me to go out of my way to create an account on Practo just to post this. She prescribed me some medication *** * *** ****** * *** **** **** ******** ********* *** ****** ***** **** **** ***** **** **** *** ***** ***** ***** *** ***** *** ********* *** ** **** Savitha's actual visit in itself is as short as a 2min phone call.. but rather than saying what I needed to do she said she would have to see me even before hearing what I had to say.. Before I could ever talk about what happened she told me I needed to come down to the hospital. ********* ***** **** ***** **** ** ** *** *** ****** 

In summary, she does not explain the problem at hand, brushes things off and does not talk about what to do unless asked *** **** *** **** **** *** ** ********** *** ********

I asked her as a 30 year old, are there things I need to be concerned about problems that can happen with pregnancy post 30, and she snapped saying she cannot and will not address my questions as I'm not married and these are future concerns.

,"Gynae Problems,",0,0,NO,"Doctor suggested all the tests worth around 10K and later upon getting all the tests done with all efforts, Doctor do not have patience to answer our queries,
Doctor will be completely in hurry burry state of mind.

Everything was well in the first visit and upon next visit, doctor have separate time to check the follow up patients itseems and we Never knew that, or if we go outside of that time we have to pay itseems.

Not recommended for the newly married couple if you are visiting to this doctor. You can have a list of your questions ready and doctor will just answer as avoid junk food and will tell everything will be just in place at the right time.  I know doctor will be having all the answers for the questions asked but even we should know what are those answers right, just yes yes yes.. will never answer our question. 

You have to wait for days together to get your reports done at Apollo and Never expect on spot reports, schedule your appointment and wait for reports at the Report counter till they provide and even in Apollo clinic you will never get ORS solution.
