During pregnancy one has so many questions regarding workouts, work, eating and so much,  I always got logical answers from her. \nShe talks a lot to the patient always (extra than to the point check up) which is good in a way to build that friendship and trust in the 9 months so a patient also builds a bond with the doctor and feels safe and secure. \nAlso, she is very soft spoken, always listens to the feedback well which makes her a good doctor + entrepreneur as she is  running a hospital so one must be good to their patients else who cares to recommend a doctor to more folks and themselves decide to come in future. \nI have already sent my 2 friends to her and recommended many more to go to her when they plan a baby and the one comment i have passed to my friends about her is \"she is very cool. All your worries about delivering a baby will go away\".",

She patiently listened my condition and asked to go through some basic tests which are required for studying my health condition.  After reviewing the reports she immediately diagnosed that I had PCOS. Ananya explained clearly about my health condition and started treatment for this. She gave instructions and used to follow-up with my health condition regularly  time to time. After 1yr we heard the good news that we have been waiting for and I was very happy knowing that I was Pregnant. \n\nWe continued consulting with Ananya during my entire Pregnancy period and strictly followed her instructions. She always asked me to try for normal delivery only and suggested relevant diet and exercises that needs to be followed.  I'd have a list of questions noted down which she'll answer before even asking so she understands what you'd be thinking at various stages of pregnancy. She did delivery to me and finally we were blessed with a very healthy baby girl. Throughout the process she explains things in detail and calms your nerves down.\nThank you so much Ananya for everything you did to me in all these 2yrs and bringing happiness in my family. Thank you on behalf of my husband as well. \nTo summarize about Dr Ananya, She was very friendly, clam and supportive. She was always approachable. The best thing with doctor Ananya is she will not give you any unnecessary medications.\n\nI'd like to thank her for making my pregnancy journey smooth and would highly recommend her.",

Initially, i and my husband have had a little confusion to choose the best doctor, so we stepped into different hospitals in Bangalore for a better obstetrician and gynecologist.  Finally, we have met Dr. Ananya at Koshy's hospital. Her hospitality, way of talking to the patient, explanation about my condition, answering mode, and overall behavior are very good. Irrespective of time, she was responded. During delivery, she was very clear about my condition and recommended me for LSCS. We went for a second opinion (My colleague who is working as an obstetrician and gynecologist) about my condition, she told that Dr. Ananya's recommendation was clear and perfect. Dr. Ananya made my delivery very easy, and I have given birth to a girl baby. Post-delivery treatment and care were also very good, and perfect.  We thank Dr. Ananya!!\n",

During pregnancy one has so many questions regarding workouts, work, eating and so much,  I always got logical answers from her. \nShe talks a lot to the patient always (extra than to the point check up) which is good in a way to build that friendship and trust in the 9 months so a patient also builds a bond with the doctor and feels safe and secure. \nAlso, she is very soft spoken, always listens to the feedback well which makes her a good doctor + entrepreneur as she is  running a hospital so one must be good to their patients else who cares to recommend a doctor to more folks and themselves decide to come in future. \nI have already sent my 2 friends to her and recommended many more to go to her when they plan a baby and the one comment i have passed to my friends about her is \"she is very cool. All your worries about delivering a baby will go away\".",

She patiently listened my condition and asked to go through some basic tests which are required for studying my health condition.  After reviewing the reports she immediately diagnosed that I had PCOS. Ananya explained clearly about my health condition and started treatment for this. She gave instructions and used to follow-up with my health condition regularly  time to time. After 1yr we heard the good news that we have been waiting for and I was very happy knowing that I was Pregnant. \n\nWe continued consulting with Ananya during my entire Pregnancy period and strictly followed her instructions. She always asked me to try for normal delivery only and suggested relevant diet and exercises that needs to be followed.  I'd have a list of questions noted down which she'll answer before even asking so she understands what you'd be thinking at various stages of pregnancy. She did delivery to me and finally we were blessed with a very healthy baby girl. Throughout the process she explains things in detail and calms your nerves down.\nThank you so much Ananya for everything you did to me in all these 2yrs and bringing happiness in my family. Thank you on behalf of my husband as well. \nTo summarize about Dr Ananya, She was very friendly, clam and supportive. She was always approachable. The best thing with doctor Ananya is she will not give you any unnecessary medications.\n\nI'd like to thank her for making my pregnancy journey smooth and would highly recommend her.",

Initially, i and my husband have had a little confusion to choose the best doctor, so we stepped into different hospitals in Bangalore for a better obstetrician and gynecologist.  Finally, we have met Dr. Ananya at Koshy's hospital. Her hospitality, way of talking to the patient, explanation about my condition, answering mode, and overall behavior are very good. Irrespective of time, she was responded. During delivery, she was very clear about my condition and recommended me for LSCS. We went for a second opinion (My colleague who is working as an obstetrician and gynecologist) about my condition, she told that Dr. Ananya's recommendation was clear and perfect. Dr. Ananya made my delivery very easy, and I have given birth to a girl baby. Post-delivery treatment and care were also very good, and perfect.  We thank Dr. Ananya!!\n",

As a normal human tendency we got panicked to go for a surgery. But, Dr. Ananya took care of my mother very well and my mother was able to walk from the very next day of surgery! (she didn't even felt any kind of pain).\n\nShe is always so kind and caring and always makes you feel good. I really appreciate the level of patience she shows to her patients. The best part is no matter how many silly questions you ask, she answers to that. ***** **** ****** **** **** **** I strongly recommend Dr. Ananya.\n\n\n",

Really for first visit itself I was satisfied with her consultation so decided to continue. Regarding my journey of 9months with her it was soothing experience. She was very calm in treating everytime as I had low lying placenta, she just explained the situation and suggested me a bedrest for 2months. I just followed her words nothing complication happened. So thank you so much from the bottom of my heart and such a care of me during pregnancy and delivery. I had a planned requested C section on 25th February. Thanks for doing a good job with delivering our sweet baby girl. Finally I would like to say. I will definitely choose her for my next pregnancy and delivery. As well as if she continues her service for another 30years I'll choose her for my daughter's delivery also. You are an amazing doctor and beautiful person. Me, my husband and my daughter really thanking you in tons.",

She stresses on the factors which can be modifiable by healthy lifestyle\n3. She doesn't exaggerate the issues which are beyond anyones control, she always maintains her cool while answering \nShe was very supportive throughout the pregnancy during delivery and post delivery care.

Even after five years of trial i failed to conceive.After consultanting with her, I conceived and decided to go for full pregnancy check up and delivery only by her guidance. She is a friendly doctor and never let us feel uncomfortable and always respond positively. Yesterday I gave birth my first child,Honestly it was never possible without her presence,despite zero coperartion from me she did all alone with her team. Without her personal support I might not delivered normally. I highly  recommend (DR.ANANYA POLAM REDDY ),feminnt,clinic Shegeheli Branch,Banaglore. Thank you Dr. Ananya. We as a new parents have no words to express our joy. ",

She  is very friendly, ****** ************* and explains about the treatment or problem very well with patience.One of the best quality which I liked in her is Responsiveness.
