5. Your condition was such that you required a personal visit and ultrasounds which unfortunately cannot be given on teleconsultation , hence you were asked to visit a  specialist  personally as you were staying  abroad 
6. Blaming us saying we dont see reports , we have not even given u treatment or solution is totally wrong. We cannot simply put a patient on medicines without having the beef or tools for check ups . i heard u with lot of patience and very well remember what we spoke regarding your health
