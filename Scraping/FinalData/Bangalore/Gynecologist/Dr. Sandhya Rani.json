Her thorough explanations and consistently positive outlook were uplifting and reassuring. She genuinely listens and provides personalized care, ensuring a supportive and individualized experience.\n\nI remember a time when we were consulting with another doctor at the start of pregnancy and how on the advice of my sister we switched to her, and how good that decision was. She was so warm to our needs and concerns and helped us so much. She would carefully monitor how we are progressing in terms of baby weight and Mother's weight ensuring we hit the right numbers for a successful normal delivery.\n\nHer approach prioritizes natural methods, contributing to our successful normal delivery. \n\nOverall, I will say each consultation with her leaves you feeling content and cared for!",

I'm sharing my detailed experience below.We visited Dr. Sandhya Rani to confirm pregnancy as first time parents. In the first visit itself, the doctor listened to our questions patiently and explained every relevant detail very clearly. As pregnancy progressed, she was so reassuring for us that we decided and convinced our parents to deliver the baby here itself as opposed to home town.At each visit, she will listen and patiently answer to the list of questions (yes, we had a list at each visit :) ) and guide me with the diet and exercises to have a healthy pregnancy.At the end of 38th week, I noticed reduced movement but my family assured it happens occasionally.  But what was ringing in my mind is the only advice doctor gave after 36 weeks, report for any reduced fetal activity. We checked at the L&D ward and by that time, baby's movement was normal as well as the FHR. Doctor still asked for a growth scan which revealed low amniotic fluid. We were explained the pros and cons of waiting for natural contractions and decided to go with induction as baby was term already. I got admitted at the hospital on the same night for induction but labor only started next afternoon. With 5 hours of active and intense labor gave birth to my sweet baby that day.Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Sandhya Rani and her team who were very kind and supportive throughout my pregnancy and delivery process. Also, the nursing and support staff at Aster Whitefield are really the best and took great care of us. ",

When my water broke on a Sunday evening after my 37th week, I had an idea of what was happening and was calm and just sent a text msg to the Doctor for confirmation of whatever that was happening.

You feel like you are talking to a family member. *** ***** *********** *********** ****** ********** Stressed a lot on healthy diet and exercise. Always kept the weight in check, never letting me put on too much weight. And most of all, when I discussed about my fears of normal delivery from the first pregnancy, she was very empathetic and understood my concerns. She ensured to make me feel as comfortable as possible. She stressed not just on physical, but also emotional well being of expecting and new mothers by allowing to be open about the doubts and fears.She was present during my delivery even around midnight. My delivery experience couldn't have been any more positive. And on top of that my post delivery recovery has been very quick and smooth. I feel healthy, positive and happy!I highly recommend Dr. Sandhya to every woman looking for gynaec consultation. Best wishes to you, doctor. We are utterly grateful to you. ",

She is very calm and cool, non fear mongering and she doesn't prescribe unnecessary tests and medicines. She takes her time explaining any questions and doubts you have, puts you at ease and is always reachable.\n\nDuring my pregnancy, I had an episode of SCH bleeding which she handled very well and put me at ease. Also, for elevated blood sugar levels, she suggested to try diet and exercise to bring it in control rather than jumping directly to medicines. With her support, I could maintain normal sugar levels just by diet and exercise, and didn't need insulin. All through my pregnancy, she provided the right kind of support and hand-holding every step of the way. She was also ready to try VBAC if I didn't have any other complications and reached full term. \n\nThank you Dr Sandhya Rani for helping me meet my bundle of joy. We are blessed to have a doctor like her and I would highly recommend her.\n",

Her thorough explanations and consistently positive outlook were uplifting and reassuring. She genuinely listens and provides personalized care, ensuring a supportive and individualized experience.\n\nI remember a time when we were consulting with another doctor at the start of pregnancy and how on the advice of my sister we switched to her, and how good that decision was. She was so warm to our needs and concerns and helped us so much. She would carefully monitor how we are progressing in terms of baby weight and Mother's weight ensuring we hit the right numbers for a successful normal delivery.\n\nHer approach prioritizes natural methods, contributing to our successful normal delivery. \n\nOverall, I will say each consultation with her leaves you feeling content and cared for!",

I'm sharing my detailed experience below.We visited Dr. Sandhya Rani to confirm pregnancy as first time parents. In the first visit itself, the doctor listened to our questions patiently and explained every relevant detail very clearly. As pregnancy progressed, she was so reassuring for us that we decided and convinced our parents to deliver the baby here itself as opposed to home town.At each visit, she will listen and patiently answer to the list of questions (yes, we had a list at each visit :) ) and guide me with the diet and exercises to have a healthy pregnancy.At the end of 38th week, I noticed reduced movement but my family assured it happens occasionally.  But what was ringing in my mind is the only advice doctor gave after 36 weeks, report for any reduced fetal activity. We checked at the L&D ward and by that time, baby's movement was normal as well as the FHR. Doctor still asked for a growth scan which revealed low amniotic fluid. We were explained the pros and cons of waiting for natural contractions and decided to go with induction as baby was term already. I got admitted at the hospital on the same night for induction but labor only started next afternoon. With 5 hours of active and intense labor gave birth to my sweet baby that day.Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Sandhya Rani and her team who were very kind and supportive throughout my pregnancy and delivery process. Also, the nursing and support staff at Aster Whitefield are really the best and took great care of us. ",

She will calm us down if we panic for any issue. 99% she will try for normal delivery. She will patiently wait until pain comes. On my big I had to go for cesearian due umbilical cord wrapped around my baby neck. After delivery also she will suggests good health care. I am satisfied to visit this doctor.",

You feel like you are talking to a family member. *** ***** *********** *********** ****** ********** Stressed a lot on healthy diet and exercise. Always kept the weight in check, never letting me put on too much weight. And most of all, when I discussed about my fears of normal delivery from the first pregnancy, she was very empathetic and understood my concerns. She ensured to make me feel as comfortable as possible. She stressed not just on physical, but also emotional well being of expecting and new mothers by allowing to be open about the doubts and fears.She was present during my delivery even around midnight. My delivery experience couldn't have been any more positive. And on top of that my post delivery recovery has been very quick and smooth. I feel healthy, positive and happy!I highly recommend Dr. Sandhya to every woman looking for gynaec consultation. Best wishes to you, doctor. We are utterly grateful to you. ",

She is very calm and cool, non fear mongering and she doesn't prescribe unnecessary tests and medicines. She takes her time explaining any questions and doubts you have, puts you at ease and is always reachable.\n\nDuring my pregnancy, I had an episode of SCH bleeding which she handled very well and put me at ease. Also, for elevated blood sugar levels, she suggested to try diet and exercise to bring it in control rather than jumping directly to medicines. With her support, I could maintain normal sugar levels just by diet and exercise, and didn't need insulin. All through my pregnancy, she provided the right kind of support and hand-holding every step of the way. She was also ready to try VBAC if I didn't have any other complications and reached full term. \n\nThank you Dr Sandhya Rani for helping me meet my bundle of joy. We are blessed to have a doctor like her and I would highly recommend her.\n",

Furthermore, even in such tensed situation (for us), she maintained her calm,  explained every next step in detail - why she is doing and what is the expected outcome and what would be the next step, etc.We would highly recommend that anyone who is planning or would like to plan should go and consult her once and experience for yourself everything that we mentioned about her.",

My first pregnancy was easy and typical, but my second pregnancy was more significant. I was a little afraid this time because I was having complications. There was no ambiguity once the doctor outlined the necessary precautions and the recommended diet. When my waterbag began to leak in the 33rd week, we phoned Ma'am at midnight. She urged us to head straight to the hospital. We visited the hospital and were given admission. A c-section was quickly decided the next morning after a diagnosis and scan revealed a breach of position. I gave birth to a baby boy in the afternoon. I appreciate her rapid diagnosis and care for me. I sincerely appreciate her assistance at odd hours. She is kind and compassionate, a lifesaver, soft-spoken, and rigorous without being compulsive when listening to your problems. These qualities set her to stand out from the crowd.",

Dr.  Sandhya\u2019s commitment to promoting the natural birth process was evident in every interaction, giving us faith in the beauty of childbirth despite its inherent challenges.\n\nHer incredible politeness and professionalism made each visit a comforting experience. Her in-depth explanations of our situation always made us feel well-informed and involved, never leaving any stone unturned. \n\nWhat makes Dr. Sandhya truly exceptional is her extraordinary handling of high-risk pregnancies. My wife's journey was categorized as such, and the gravity of our situation was no secret to us. But in Dr. Sandhya\u2019s capable hands, our fears were replaced with confidence. She navigated us through each twist and turn with a level of ease and expertise that can only be described as magical.\n\nOur journey to bringing our precious baby into this world was fraught with potential challenges, but Dr. Sandhya made it seamless. Her unwavering dedication, deep knowledge, and compassionate care not only ensured the safe arrival of our baby but also made the entire experience one of the most memorable and enriching ones for us as parents.\n\nWe wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Sandhya Rani to all expectant parents. Her services are unparalleled, and her commitment to her patients is unquestionable. We cannot thank her enough for making this challenging journey a beautiful one for us.\n\nThank you, Dr.  Sandhya Rani, for your exceptional care and support.",

As a first time parents we had lot of questions and everything was well explained in detail.\n\nShe was always encouraging us for normal delivery and  provided tips/ suggestions in every consultation to make it happen( But unfortunately by body didn\u2019t support for normal delivery and i had to go through C- Section). \n\nShe is very positive.We had smooth and stress free pregnancy because for her. \n\nI would highly recommend her.  \nThanks Sandhya Mam.",

She prescribes as less medicine as possible and makes sure that the patient is comfortable for any examination. I always feel at home when mam is around... Such an amazing and friendly doctor with a lot of expertise who always prefers normal delivery..!! She filled lot of positivity in us and eliminated lot of unwanted treatments which other gynaecs suggested and helped us conceive naturally. Heartfelt thanks to our beloved doctor and feeling blessed to have her around. .A big thanks to the entire staff of Aster and especially the nursing staff. The entire team of nurses  were very well trained in dealing with new borns. They were all alert 24/7 in helping the patients and taking nice care of them. Had a satisfactory journey with Aster and would definitely recommend Aster and Dr Sandhya Rani. ",

We visited her 3 months prior to planning our baby for pre-pregnancy check up and to get a feel of the doctor. From day one of meeting her I had expressed my wish for VBAC and she was fully supportive of that. Guided us through the pre-pregnancy period. I was 2 months pregnant when my husband, my son and I got covid. Dr. Sandhya Ma'am listened to all our worries, guided us and became a shoulder to cry on during post covid recovery period. She shared her direct contact number and was reachable on WhatsApp through out. Suggested diet modifications, exercises. Though in anomaly scan showed low lying placenta, Dr. was optimistic and cheered me up to keep my spirits up. However the placenta did not move up. Though I couldn't fulfill my dream for a VBAC and had to undergo elective c sec due to placenta previa, I was given a respectful and dignified birthing experience by Dr. Sandhya Rani and team. This is an experience that I'll take to my grave.\nDoctor is very empathetic, kind human being who sees her patients with utmost respect and values their feelings. It was my request to have skin to skin, delayed cord clamping, and golden hour breastfeeding. All of these wishes got fulfilled only because of Dr.\nA respectful and dignified birthing experience is a right of every woman. I was denied that in my first delivery at my home town. But I'm forever grateful to God for bringing Dr. Sandhya Rani to my life. Dr gave me the best birthing experience. She is a blessing.",

As first-time parents, we wanted a doctor who would be understanding and would address our anxiety and concerns. After unsatisfactory consultations with a couple of gynecologists, we came across Dr. Sandhya. Reading all her positive testimonies, we decided to visit her during the initial stages of pregnancy, when the conception was yet to be confirmed. And I must say, it was such a fortunate decision, as she went all the way to help us listen to our baby\u2019s first heartbeat. Dr. Sandhya Rani has been like a God-sent gift; with her expertise and knowledge of so many years, she ensured I had a healthy pregnancy and a normal and healthy delivery. Every problem throughout my pregnancy was dealt with with so much affirmation that it would have been a difficult road otherwise. She would take time to explain everything in detail and discuss every small query with so much grace. From staying fit to eating the right food, she assisted me in every way possible in achieving the goal of having a normal delivery. Even during labor, she was so professional and aware of the tiniest developments that I was relieved even at the sight of her in the labor room. And to add to that, she is very down-to-earth for someone of such stature and calibre. She was like a motherly figure to me, and honestly, just seeing her face and talking to her would really make all my worries and problems go away. I sincerely believe that if it would have been any other doctor, I wouldn\u2019t have had a normal delivery with a healthy baby. There would not be enough words to express my gratitude for all she has done during my pregnancy, and even after that, she is available to address all my postpartum concerns too. I thank her from the bottom of my heart for all she has done. I hope all expecting parents find such a gem of a Doctor!",

Highly recommended doctor who gives you confidence throughout the journey and even on the delivery day. ",

She never recommends unnecessary medicines; instead guides us to follow proper diet. She recommended to do the required excercises which would be helpful for normal delivery. From the beginning she always encouraged for normal delivery. Though we asked to do C section because of uncontrollable pain, she and her team recommended for vaginal delivery and we are blessed with our bundle of joy(baby boy).Thank you Doctor for all your support and guidance throughout my pregnancy journey.",

She will not give uneccessary Medications and the best thing about the Dr is she shares her personal contact number ( which is very rare) if in case of any emergency or queries to be asked and she responses very quickly. Overall my pregancy journey went very smoothly without any issues and delivered healthy baby boy weighing 3.4kgs via natural vaginal delivery( NVD) thankful to Sandhya maam .

As I have Diabetes which are really high level, thyroid and most important thing is that I am differently abler by birth. Among all these we went and met the doctor whether to proceed are not. It\u2019s really hard to continue based on my medical history but Dr. Sandhya Rani madam is very supported us to continue further and will handle whatever the issues comes.There at the point a hope has created and started my pregnancy journey. Initial 12 weeks went normal and suddenly bleeding has been started though it\u2019s late night Doctor responded immediately and arranged all the necessary things backend through hospital staff before we reach hospital. All the necessary scan are taken for baby. During my NT scan nasal bone has not developed for baby and we are really panicked but doctor did not make us disappointed and suggested for NIPT test where we get the result whether it\u2019s a genetic issue, like this we have faced many issues till 25 weeks of pregnancy. It\u2019s been a mixed felling where we came up with lot of confusion and questions but Doctor Sandhya Rani madam gave us all her support and confidence and treated us very carefully. Finally we reached our most awaited moment and delivered a healthy baby boy on 24th Nov-2021 with all the support of Doctor Sandhya Rani madam. We want to thank from the bottom of our heart to the Sandhya Rani Madam. Once again thank you so much \ud83d\ude0a.",

Doctor encouraged me so well and everything went well though I had blood loss during c section I recovered soon very well and I am able to take care of my baby now. All thanks to doctor sandhya for standing by me and helping me through the process. what I liked more about the doctor is she looks into the problem from all perspectives she studied my history and case thoroughly took suggestions from other doctors as well , explained evry detail thoroughly and made the process very smooth. I am very happy about whole process and would highly recommended doctor sandhya for all gynec issues.",

She is amazing, the way she listens to patient's concerns, explains causes and remedies, guides through all processes, is commendable. She assured me of all procedures and birth plan options ahead of my EDD, I had a very clear notion of what to anticipate during the delivery process and was thus, stressfree all the time. Dr even took extreme care to ensure no complications remain post delivery owing to my hereditary maternal case of Postpartum haemorrhage.Thanks doctor \ud83d\ude0a",

From the 1st appointment till the very final delivery day, Dr Sandhya has been all of the above and much more. By the end of 9 months, my trust and confidence in her was so much, that i finally had no questions or fears. Her experience made sure i had a normal delivery, and my baby stayed safe through the various risks along the way.\nColumbia asia is 5 mins from my house but we preferred totravel to apollo cradle (20-30 mins) for Dr. Sandhya. I am truly grateful to Dr. Sandhya for bringing not just her expertise to the table, but also filling her patients with confidence and a sense of calm, in turn ensuring a safe and healthy pregnancy.\nWe couldnt have asked for more.",

Throughout our experience, Mam has provided us with important information and valuable guidance. she has always ensured that we had all the knowledge and support we needed. She was calm, listened attentively and responded positively for all our concerns. She was even available for our urgent queries.\nWhen we discovered a concerning finding during the 7-month growth scan, we were initially shocked.\nOur baby needed a surgery after the delivery. During this challenging time, she provided us enough confidence and helped us maintain a positive mindset throughout. She suggested us to follow all the necessary steps in order to extend the delivery period. Extending the delivery period means baby gaining more weight and maturity. Her Guidance really helped to extend the delivery date by few weeks, even though it was premature delivery.\nFor the baby surgery and other supports, Initially Mam had only consulted paediatric surgeon and NICU Doctor within the hospital and ensured that all necessary preparations were made for the delivery and subsequent surgery that our baby required.\nIt has been almost a month and a half since the baby underwent surgery, and we are happy to share that the baby is currently in a healthy condition.\nWe consider ourselves lucky to have had Mam's guidance and support throughout our pregnancy journey.\nWe are extremely grateful.",

She also explained me what are all the challenges and guided us the with the contact of the supporting bed too. During that time we had a regular followup with mam over phone every week and she was available in all the time whenever we needed her. After removing the stitches I have delivered a healthy baby boy through normal delivery even though my baby had cord around the neck. The best thing about her is she supports normal delivery and never let you give a thought about  c section. Even after delivery she did continous follow ups and made sure all okay till we get discharged. We were so lucky to meet her at the right time. The amount of positivity you get after meeting her is enormous as she reads your mind well and gives right words to make you feel good. She is the go to person for all your queries and can solve your issues. We are so thankful as she is the reason for our pregnancy journey without any issue and for our little prince.",

But I was scared and tensed because of the incident happened in first delivery time. We were searching for good doctor in Bangalore especially who does Normal vaginal delivery and luckily we got Sandya Rani Madam by seeing Google reviews. During my first visit to the doctor in Aster white field, itself we decided that she was the correct person to deal my situation. We just followed her instructions on regular check ups and scannings. Each and every time we go to the doctor she treated me like her family member and explained each and everything very clearly. Even though your appointment time is 15 mins, she never looked at time, some times we spent 30 mins also. She has lot patience and if you ask some silly questions also she never got irritated and explained very patiently. Especially she will be available at any time if you have some emergency. We  suffered a lot regarding baby movements( baby used to move and he was doing good, but I didn\u2019t feel movements for whole day sometimes) in 7th and 8th month especially, she responded each and everytime we contacted her. At last she did normal vaginal delivery even though my baby boy has two cords around the neck. I am always thankful to her for her friendly ness and caring. I strongly recommend sandya Rani Madam for patients.",

She always encouraged us for perfect medical state and thus the normal delivery. The diet and exercise plan she provided was easy to follow and  worked wonders. Even though my wife age is 35, it never came up as a hindrance for the normal delivery, thanks to the encouragement by the doctor especially when she was in labor. We were blessed with a baby boy.\n\n\nI also need to give special credit to the nursing staffs of labour room department whose support and encouragement during the labor was remarkable.The ward nursing staffs at Aster are also very polite and always willing to help.\n\nI would strongly recommend Dr. Sandhya for a smooth pregnancy journey and a normal vaginal delivery, and the nursing staffs at Aster were the icing on the cake for our overall experience.\n\nThank You Dr. Sandhya and the nursing staffs!",

I'm sharing my detailed experience below: we visited Dr. Sandhya Rani from my 2nd month as I was misguided by some other doc and they were giving me unnecessary injections, the doctor listened to us and explained every related detail very clearly.  As pregnancy progressed, she was so reassuring for us that we decided to continue the deliver. In each visit she has listened to us patiently and guided me with proper diet and exercise along with necessary medicine. When we have asked for normal delivery she explained us tge fact regarding this qnd when can it be performed. Whenever I have a doubt regarding the movement, she has suggested me to come for check up over whatsapp. When I was in my 37th week and went for check up because of low movement and she was on leave. She was asking to her teammate for the reports and suggested for the delivery. I got admitted that day and the process started. I was admitted at 11 and delivery done by 9 in her presence through natural contraction. Our heartily gratitude to Dr. Sandhy Rani and her team, all nursing and supported staff who were kind and supportive throughout my delivery. She was really a blessing, ***** ***** *** *********** ****** ********* I would highly recommend her. ",

My wife was 37 years old and second baby after 11 years. So we were soo worried about doctor and facilities.  \n\nBut, On my first visit to Dr. Sandhya Rani, we noticed that she is knowledgeable, good human being, good listener and best experience doctor, so we decided to continue with her only for delivery.  \n\nShe treated us very good throughout the pregnancy period and we got normal delivery only on 7th month. 37 years of wife delivered baby boy with normal procedure only. It was happened with the support of Dr. Sandhya Rani. \n\nIn fact we rushed for emergency on 7th month end. But doctor treated very well, waited so much time and encouraged for normal delivery only. \n\nShe don't write much medicine and don't write unnecessary labs too.\n\nShe is very very soft speaking, nice, ************* and good listener. \n\nI can suggest to visit her with out having second thought in mind..\n\n",

But I am really fortunate that I met with Dr Sandhya, a polite and calm person who listen to you very carefully and treat you very nicely with minimal medications if required.I delivered a baby boy on August 25th through normal delivery and without her I can't even imagine to go for normal delivery. **** * *** *** *** ** *** **** **** *** I met. one more moment I remember when my baby's heartbeat was dropping and I was not able to give my effort for last push, she took a smart decesion to pull my champ out and the encouragement she was giving during the process was commendable.I can just say, you are the best. and I will recommend each n every person to meet you once for any gynecological issues.

I went to visit her for my first pregnancy for regular checkups in my pregnancy period . Being a first time mom , I was kind of worried but she solved my all concerns and queries with a smile . I had an amazing experience with Dr.Sandhya . Her expertise and care made my pregnancy journey very smooth. She takes time to listen the concerns and answers all the queries politely. Having a history of family diabetes, I had elevated sugar during 7th month of my pregnancy but with her suggestion and support, I successfully maintained my sugar back to normal . During my whole pregnancy she was there for support and care and she helped me in delivering a healthy baby in my 9th month . I can\u2019t thank her enough in words . I definitely recommend Dr.Sandhya Rani to every would be mother , she will provide all the care and support a mother needs.",

Dr Sandya Rani always supports normal delivery from the start and Our Delivery process also went smoothly with Normal delivery and it was a very nice experience under her guidance and support.

I had lot of anxiety issues through out my pregnancy phase and no one would have handled me better than her. Only thing I did was to trust her. Now, i am a proud mother today . She never suggested unnecessary medicines, scans. Her way of treating patients is very captivating. She would give a smile and say \"everything is alright\". That gave me lot of encouragement and assurance. She would never disappoint you and i learnt from her that everything is possible with little patience. She was always available in the time of need. You will find many gynaecologists, but if you also want someone who would talk to you and understand you, she is the highly recommended one.",

Later I consulted with Sandhy Rani Madam and without offending the other doctor she guided us very well about the medicines to take. She has always been like a family. Very simple and she explains things very well with pateince. She will be reachable anytime of the day of there is any issue. She didn't let us panic through out the journey and helped us to take decision about delivery. Having such a doctor around is a big thing.",

She gave me time after the procedure to relax and held my hand for a long time. She is not only a great doctor but also a kind and loving human being. Being new parents we didn't know anything about caring for a child, she also helped with that. No words can express my gratitude for all her help, warmth and understanding. My baby girl is more than a month old now. May God always bless her. I'll recommend her to anyone who needs a fabulous doctor and a supporting friend.",

I didn't have to worry about anything during my pregnancy as she properly takes care of everything without ignoring even minute details. She is always on time and there was never a delay in appointments. Right from the beginning of my consultation she encouraged me to go for normal delivery. Though I followed all her instructions on diet and exercises, I still had doubts on myself if I would be able to give birth normally. But she made it possible! I gave birth to a healthy baby boy last month :) \nA huge thanks to Sandhya Mam :)",

She helped us with diagnosis and operation of polypectomy initially and then from getting us pregnant to happily delivering a baby girl naturally!! It was Dr.Sandhya who was more determined to go for a natural delivery than me, we owe it to her for our healthy baby.! Right from getting pregnant to delivery her guidance was top notch, we just took her word and followed it.She not only gave medical suggestions but also helped me get through emotionally with assurance and care. she gave a combination of physical and mental wellbeing, Often spent enough time with us clarifying all our questions pre and post natal. she also took care in following up with my glucose levels to minimize gestational diabetes, with both dietary inputs and physical exercises.! I could literally jump up within 36hours of my delivery and all the credit goes to her!",

After consulting with numerous doctors across Bangalore, we reached late at 9th month of my wife's pregnancy but I felt this one of the best decision I have made in my life for the sake of my family. Eventhough it was late she listened to all our pregnancy history politely and took more than 10mins to go through all the past medical consultant records, which gives our 1st hope. And then she explained about further treatment and work outs to be followed. After 3 weeks of consultation my wife delivered a healthy girl baby through NVD without epidural. Dr. Sandhya is the only reason for my wife's NVD, the encouragement and politeness in handling the patient at that moment gave moral strength for my wife.After my wife delivery she said these words \"Am glad that I have fulfilled you 1st request of normal delivery\".Thank you so much doctor. You are mother Goddess.",

The supporting team too was cooperative which drived a normal delivery, instead of me insisting for cesarean considering my physical and emotional state. They know well what is better for you. \nWe never felt as visiting a doctor, it was always like visiting a family friend who gives right suggestions and moral support during bad phase of life. \nVery attentive and a good listener.

I can't thank enough her the way she has taken care of everything throughout my pregnancy journey.",

In the first meeting itself with Dr. Sandhya, I and my wife got that comfort and assurance and we knew that she is the one who is going to deliver our baby.  Really listens to the patient. Every minute details are taken care of. At the delivery time, she came early morning and ensured a smooth delivery of my princess \ud83d\udc78 through a normal process. Everything was handled perfectly. She and her team did an awesome job. I must say she is empathetic, ************** patient, and a wonderful gynecologist. Dr. SANDHYA, THANK you for your care during the pregnancy and for the safe delivery of our baby princess \ud83d\udc78. ",

She is very understanding and always gave positive vibes even in the toughest times I had gone through during pregnancy.

I had to undergo an emergency c-section due to the baby pooping inside the womb and reduced heartbeat but till the last moment, she tried for normal delivery. Her treatment approach for natural delivery is highly commendable. Pre and postnatal care were systematic with regular follow-up and essential medications. Overall, Motherhood is joyful due to Dr. Sandhya Rani. Maybe a goddess in disguise..",
