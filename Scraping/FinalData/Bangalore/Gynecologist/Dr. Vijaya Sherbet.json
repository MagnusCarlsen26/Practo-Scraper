Though it was the last appointment for me, she had the same interest and patience to understand and provide the right solution. 11 years back she delivered my baby and i cannot forget that. She takes care of me like a kid. So adorable person. Ma'am, you need an assistant to type and change bed sheets each time, don't take so much stress by doing everything by yourself. Hats off to your efforts. She had started her day from morning 5.30 am and still so dedicated at her work till evening 7.30 pm. She is an amazing lady with great experience. We need such doctors in life where we can trust for years together. ",

She delivered my son in the month of feb 2020.\nThe first time i had met her was when i consulted her for my pregnancy in 2019 which unfortunately resulted in a miscarriage. But she was so positive and practical through that experience that i knew that if i was to get pregnant again she would be my doctor. A year later when i was pregnant i went back to her and i am so happy i did. She is someone i would recommend a hundred percent to any pregnant mom. *** ** ****** ************* *** *** ********* ** **** **** *** keeping up information and standards across the world. She is not someone who will mollycoddle you but at the same time she is so patient and non judgemental. She will answer all your questions with a lot of patience and practicality. Even through my delivery when things got tough i felt safe and calm because of her. She is someone i would close my eyes and go back to every single time.\nI hope Dr Sherbet gets to read this because we are thankful for the entire pregnancy and delivery experience we went through because of her. \nThank you!

I would provide here the honest feedback of this doctor. This is to help others who will face the same circumstances when dealing with her.\n\nWe had heard good feedback for her and hence decide to pursue with her. *** ** * ********** **** ****** **** **** ********* ***** ******* ******* *** ************** She will greet you with smile, explain you the tests that needs to be done and medicines to be taken. You will also have very basic questions to ask.\n\nHowever, when the complication arise in the pregnancy then it's hard to get any good explanation of a question. It is also very hard to predict if your pregnancy will develop a complication. Complication can arise anytime. I would STRONGLY SUGGEST you to switch doctor if there is any complication. PLEASE DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES AND LEARN FROM MY EXPERIENCE.\n\nThese are the problems you will face with her in complicated pregnancy\n1. A complicated pregnancy comes with lot of trauma on parents. They generally have multiple questions. It's very hard to not ask your friends (or google) and clarify with your doctor. Doctor Vijaya doesn't entertain additional questions. She will behave rigidly and would expect you to move along without any queries. In our case, even one query got her irritated. The experience turn sour so quickly that we were not sure what to ask her.\n\n1. She takes thing to heart. ** *** *** ** ***** *********** *** **** *** ********** **** ****** ********* *** *** **** Cross questioning could be simply asking these type of questions: Why are you saying 'something ......', my friend had the same problem but could continue for longer duration before surgery. She doesn't like to be cross questioned or probed for clarification. From this point onwards, her behavior will become rigid towards you.\n\n1. I have never once saw her trying to console us ** ****** ******* When you are dealing with complicated pregnancy, few consoling words from your doctor can work magic on you. ** * ******* *** ********* ** * ****** ****** ** ******* ******* ** **** ******** ****** *** *****She will never say words like these: \"don't worry, you try to do what I am saying and lets pray and hope for the best\".

I am extremely happy with dr Vijay and the way she takes care of her patients is commendable.\nIf you are looking for best gynecologist at North side of Bangalore then Dr Vijaya is the BEST. she is flexible, friendly, approachable and genuine doctor.she knows what patient expect from doctor and she listen to the problem and provide best solution to it. She never makes u panic and she stands for you till baby delivered. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and other doctors scared me due to high sugar level. But when i consulted dr Vijaya she gave me confidence that my baby is safe and sugar levels can be controlled easily. She was always available on phone and make sure i get right advise at right Time. I got motherly feeling whenever i consulted her. I am blessed to get my baby delivered by dr.vijaya. i will bet you others will also feel the same. Just thought of sharing my experience so that other will come to know how good dr Vijaya is and this makes expecting mother to land in safe hands to deliver their baby. Lots of Love Dr Vijaya. \n\nThanks\nParvin",

She did not push me to make any decisions and I felt in control through out my pregnancy and delivery. Even during my labour she never pushed me to take an Epidural or suggested any other procedures when I refused to take any pain relief measures until I was sure I really needed them. The nursing staff at Columbia Asia Hebbal were also super kind and patient and really supported me through my entire labour and delivery. Thank you so much Doc and the entire team at Columbia Asia.",

I then asked her if this can be a cause for concern and if it's related to periods but she rudely asked me have you studied science before. I mentioned to her that I am a bio student so she can explain..After taking 800 for consultation I believe it's her duty to answer the queries with patience rather than asking if we are educated. ** * *** ****** *** ********* *** ****** * *** ** **** ** ******* *****we visited her twice both times the experience was bad.

And experienced as well. \r\n\r\nShe is not biased with in terms of rich or poor. She is not rude unlike other doctors.

Hats off to your efforts. She had started her day from morning 5.30 am and still so dedicated at her work till evening 7.30 pm. She is an amazing lady with great experience.

She delivered my son in the month of feb 2020.\nThe first time i had met her was when i consulted her for my pregnancy in 2019 which unfortunately resulted in a miscarriage. But she was so positive and practical through that experience that i knew that if i was to get pregnant again she would be my doctor. A year later when i was pregnant i went back to her and i am so happy i did. She is someone i would recommend a hundred percent to any pregnant mom. *** ** ****** ************* *** *** ********* ** **** **** *** keeping up information and standards across the world. She is not someone who will mollycoddle you but at the same time she is so patient and non judgemental. She will answer all your questions with a lot of patience and practicality. Even through my delivery when things got tough i felt safe and calm because of her. She is someone i would close my eyes and go back to every single time.\nI hope Dr Sherbet gets to read this because we are thankful for the entire pregnancy and delivery experience we went through because of her. \nThank you! Regards Smita & Rahul",

I would provide here the honest feedback of this doctor. This is to help others who will face the same circumstances when dealing with her.\n\nWe had heard good feedback for her and hence decide to pursue with her. *** ** * ********** **** ****** **** **** ********* ***** ******* ******* *** ************** She will greet you with smile, explain you the tests that needs to be done and medicines to be taken. You will also have very basic questions to ask.\n\nHowever, when the complication arise in the pregnancy then it's hard to get any good explanation of a question. It is also very hard to predict if your pregnancy will develop a complication. Complication can arise anytime. I would STRONGLY SUGGEST you to switch doctor if there is any complication. PLEASE DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES AND LEARN FROM MY EXPERIENCE.\n\nThese are the problems you will face with her in complicated pregnancy\n1. A complicated pregnancy comes with lot of trauma on parents. They generally have multiple questions. It's very hard to not ask your friends (or google) and clarify with your doctor. Doctor Vijaya doesn't entertain additional questions. She will behave rigidly and would expect you to move along without any queries. In our case, even one query got her irritated. The experience turn sour so quickly that we were not sure what to ask her.\n\n1. She takes thing to heart. ** *** *** ** ***** *********** *** **** *** ********** **** ****** ********* *** *** **** Cross questioning could be simply asking these type of questions: Why are you saying 'something ......', my friend had the same problem but could continue for longer duration before surgery. She doesn't like to be cross questioned or probed for clarification. From this point onwards, her behavior will become rigid towards you.\n\n1. I have never once saw her trying to console us ** ****** ******* When you are dealing with complicated pregnancy, few consoling words from your doctor can work magic on you. ** * ******* *** ********* ** * ****** ****** ** ******* ******* ** **** ******** ****** *** *****She will never say words like these: \"don't worry, you try to do what I am saying and lets pray and hope for the best\".

She never makes u panic and she stands for you till baby delivered. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and other doctors scared me due to high sugar level. But when i consulted dr Vijaya she gave me confidence that my baby is safe and sugar levels can be controlled easily. She was always available on phone and make sure i get right advise at right Time. I got motherly feeling whenever i consulted her. I am blessed to get my baby delivered by dr.vijaya. i will bet you others will also feel the same. Just thought of sharing my experience so that other will come to know how good dr Vijaya is and this makes expecting mother to land in safe hands to deliver their baby. Lots of Love Dr Vijaya. \n\nThanks\nParvin",

Even during my labour she never pushed me to take an Epidural or suggested any other procedures when I refused to take any pain relief measures until I was sure I really needed them. The nursing staff at Columbia Asia Hebbal were also super kind and patient and really supported me through my entire labour and delivery. Thank you so much Doc and the entire team at Columbia Asia.",

I then asked her if this can be a cause for concern and if it's related to periods but she rudely asked me have you studied science before. I mentioned to her that I am a bio student so she can explain..After taking 800 for consultation I believe it's her duty to answer the queries with patience rather than asking if we are educated. ** * *** ****** *** ********* *** ****** * *** ** **** ** ******* *****we visited her twice both times the experience was bad.

And experienced as well. \r\n\r\nShe is not biased with in terms of rich or poor. She is not rude unlike other doctors.
