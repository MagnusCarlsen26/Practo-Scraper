"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy with PCOD,",0,0,YES,"I was consulting a gynecologist in Ramamurthy nagar since it was close to my place. But for some reason me and my hubby were not confident on the Doctor's treatment and suggestions, cos I had PCOD issues and so was advised by one of our relatives to consult Dr.Akshaya Doddamani from Ovum, Hosakote. Though the hospital was quite far from my place, I decided to consult Dr. Akshaya Doddamani Mam in Ovum hospital, Hosakote, from 4th month of my pregnancy. I must say that was the best decision I had ever taken in my life. Dr. Akshaya is very friendly and kind in explaining things. No mater how worried we are about things, her subtle reactions and suggestions would ease our fears and fill in confidence. She was always available for my calls and msgs, throughout my pregnancy, despite her busy schedule. Her positivity helped me to handle the pregnancy so well. Since my water levels were slightly low and Akshaya mam was not so happy with the NST reports, around my due date,  mam suggested, induced labour and we agreed for the same. On the day of my labour, though, I created a huge ruckus and the nursing staff told me that I was completely uncooperative, and Akshaya mam was literally worried, since in the beginning of the labour process itself I was shouting like anything and was stressed out as if I was in the verge of delivery. However, the kind of positive vibe that I received in the labor room by Akshaya mam is something which I can't express through words. Her calculations were very accurate in each and every aspect. Any other Doctor in her place would have definitely suggested C-section, citing the stress that I was going through during the labour and also since the baby's weight was slightly more for a normal delivery. My hubby told later, that at that point even he had lost hopes and thought it would be Caesarean only. But, even in that stage, Akshaya mam told that she would break the water and see, and if the water is clear she said she would still prefer normal delivery. Finally, with all her efforts and support, I delivered a healthy baby boy much before the expected time, through normal delivery. My entire family is extremely happy and thankful to Dr. Akshaya mam.I strongly recommend her for each and every mother who wants to go through a safe pregnancy...Thank you Dr. Akshaya Mam for your guidance, advice and support during this beautiful pregnancy journey of mine.",2022-01-18 10:31:37,False,True,Verified Patient,Thank you.
