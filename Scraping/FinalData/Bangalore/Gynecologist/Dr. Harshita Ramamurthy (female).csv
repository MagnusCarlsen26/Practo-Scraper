"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,Wait time,","Laparoscopy Hysterectomy,",0,0,YES,Dr. Harshitha spent just the right amount of time explaining her diagnosis of my problem and also in explaining the procedure. I have rarely experienced a doctor showing such patience with questions. At no point did she make me feel like I was asking an irrelevant question. Her tone and manner were also refreshing and what I liked most was how she sought permission before conducting an internal examination. She comes across as confident and capable and it was also reassuring that minimal access surgery is her preferred technique for a hysterectomy.,2020-12-02 13:14:02,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
