Both Mom and kid are doing good without any complications. Thanks to Dr Poornima for supporting the Normal delivery as per our wish. However overall our experience at cloudnine Whitefield was horrible and I am listing a few instances here,\n\nNurses \u2013 The capability of supporting nurses is not up to the expectations per our experience, an example - the nurses did not bother to connect the NST device properly (that checks the baby heartbeat and pain before labour) until I noticed and informed them.\nThe nurses did not come at regular time/ or instruct upfront on the medications, a few time we had to call them to check (like tablets to take before food/after food)\nThe Duty doctor was very arrogant (on duty 13th Jul\u201921 nigh) \u2013 When we enquired if my wife could get Epidural because the pain at some point was intolerable, she commented sarcastically like you want a normal delivery without any pain huh?\nThe nurse as well apparently told duty doctor that we have been telling them how to use the devices (from point#1) the duty doctor then shouted at me & my wife that nurses know how to use devices better than us et.al, It would have made some sense if duty doctor had the mind to understood the problem that we tried to point out about the nurses..\nThe duty doctor also mentioned that she has been tired of treating many patient throughout night.. however for us it\u2019s our only baby and delivery for lifetime, if she is tired of work she should probably inform her superior doctors et.al and not use the patient /my wife to relive all the anger, who is been at the peak of labor, just for asking if epidural could be administered!!\nThe duty doctor than called the gynecologist(Dr. Poornima gowda) and told that we are demanding for epidural et.al which we never did (we did enquire but did NOT demand), obviously she was trying to make some points on her side..\nAfter the delivery my wife was still in tears because of the way the duty doctor mentally harassed her while she was in labor room..\nIt was not over yet.. the nurses gave bath to my wife in cold water(at 6:30am), when she said the water is very cold, the nurse threw the mug away and kept her waiting.. can\u2019t further describe..\nYes, as patients we may ask more questions in a critical time(because it\u2019s one time instance in life and the fear of unknowns) but it was the responsibility of the doctor to handle and not yell/scold the patient at that time.\nI still respect the work the duty doctor did along with Gynecologist and delivered our kid through normal delivery but I believe that does not entitle them to treat us the way they want or the mood they are in..\nWe had our first kid delivered at ovum hospital which was a very pleasant experience throughout and we had to choose Cloudnine hospital this time because we relocated to Whitefield, A decision that we will regret for lifetime..\n\n",

She looked into complete medical history one by one and helped us to understand all our details. I already had 3 miscarriages and quite trashed with it. I decided to go ahead another time and this time also in 7th week bleeding started, really emotionally challenging and breakdown situation. We rush to the hospital and loose all hope but by god's grace that day first time we booked appointment of Poornima mam. She listened me very patiently and understood my previous history and accordingly started my treatment. She explained very well why particular medicine and injections needs to be taken - how it will help along with tests (which we understood was quite important to minimize the complication) since my pregnancy was a high risk pregnancy with many complications. During pregnancy term, I faced lots of issues in 5th month with my placenta being low lying. In 7 months, Jaundice symptoms started which affected my whole body to itchy all the time but mam did not recommend any unwanted medicine and handled it very naturally. Considering all situations and due to high-risk pregnancy, my delivery was planned for the C- section and it was due on 11th Jan\u201922 but my water ruptured in 35 week 5 days. Mam waited to get pain started if I can deliver normal and she tried her best and my planned C section turned into Normal delivery. We are blessed with a baby girl on 6th Dec'21 and with all healthy vitals condition post-delivery. NO NICU required (which we were scared off). All thanks to Poornima Mam *** ** **** * *** ****** ** *** God Bless",

Based on my experience of conducting vaginal delivery after a C section and as your wife was keen for vaginal delivery we waited till 38 weeks. As she developed gestational diabetes in the 9 th month, decided to proceed with an elective C section. As per the protocol Covid test was done. As she was already in the 39th week, we decided to proceed as per the planned date despite her Covid status. There was neither hurrying for delivery nor messing up of history as you are mentioning. Of course we wanted to take all Covid safety precautions as safety of healthcare professionals is also important. Let's not forget that this thing happened when 2nd wave of Covid was peaking in Bangalore and several hundred doctors & nurses in this country had already died due to pandemic. \n\n\nRegarding your comment on sticking to timelines, most of the time we are dealing with unscheduled emergencies and patients requiring extra care / time, which could delay OPD timings. Even if I start late sometimes, I never compromise on the care & attention given to individual patients.",

Everything was going good till her 38 weeks of pregnancy except the Doctor was never on time 90% of the time and she never checks the history of the previous visit and the form which we need to fill before 15 minutes of your appointment. *** ** **** ***** ** ******** ******* ** *** ******** *** ******** **** ** ****** *** ******** *** * ****** ******** ******* * ******** On her 39th week scan i.e., on Monday 24th May, she said that she messed up with my wife's case history and asked her to take RT PCR test for Covid and plan for an elective C section delivery on 29th May. My wife gave her RT PCR samples at Cloudnine Whitefield at around 12:30 pm on 24th May. We got her report on 25th May afternoon as Covid positive with 26.5 ct value which was completely unbelievable for us as we had not gone out of our home since last 1 month. Then, we got a call from Cloudnine CRM and she told that since my wife is Covid positive, there will be extra charges for the delivery which is somewhere around 20k  . ** *********** ****** ** **** **** *** ******** ** ****** ** **** ***** ***** *** ** ** ****** ******** ** ****** *** ***** ******** ************* We video consulted the Dr on the same day and she told to postpone the delivery by at least 10 days. We took one more test for my wife, 3.5 years old daughter and me through SRL lab on Wednesday morning and we all were Covid negative. We consulted the doctor again and this time she told they will consider my wife still Covid positive to be on the safer side but she told to hurry up for the delivery and do it as per the plan i.e., on 29th May. We called the Cloudnine CRM and told her that we got negative reports now and we will not come to Cloudnine hospital for the delivery ** ** ***** ****** ** ***** ** *** ******* ** *********** ******* *** ********** ******** ****** ***** *** ******* **** **** ** ** ***** *** *** *** **** ** *********** **** **** **** **** **** ******** ** **** ** ***** ******** ***** ** **** ***** *** *** ** *** **** **** ** ******** **** *** *** *** *** ******** ****** *** ** ***** **** *** **** ***** ** **** ********* ****** ****** **** ** ******** **** *** ***** *** ** *** ** ** *** ** ********* * ******* ******** *** *** ** ****** **** *** ** *********** ** **** *** ** **** ***** ***** *** ** *** **** ** ******* ********** ** ****** ******** *** *** * ******* ******** **** *** ** ***** **** **** ******** ********* * ** *** ********* *** ****** *** ********* ******** ** ******* **** * ***** ** *** ****** ** ****** ******* ** *******",

We opted Cloudnine for initial consultation and scanning and were planning to go to my wife\u2019s hometown for delivery. After few consultation, we changed our mind to go with Cloudnine for delivery. Dr.Poornima M Gowda really made us feel more comfortable and gave us confidence which made us change our decision. Doctor and the supporting staff humbly answered all our questions related to pregnancy even if we have asked n number of times. On the day of delivery,  my wife started getting labor pain at 11am in the morning, Dr.Poornima did wait patiently till evening to deliver the baby through normal delivery. \n\nThough we were in the peak of second wave of pandemic during our second trimester, hospital has made all necessary arrangements to feel more safe. \n\nOverall we had a wonderful experience at Cloudnine and with Dr.Poornima. I would highly recommend Dr.Poornima and Cloudnine whitefield for the kind of treatment they provide and the professionalism that they follow.",

I was detected with a rare genetic condition that accelerates blood clots and blocks the blood flow to the placenta. We lost our first pregnancy due to this reason which we did not know at that point in time. Things became clear after a prothrombin panel test which showed an MTHFR gene mutation. During the second pregnancy, I was put on a daily dosage of blood thinner throughout the term. Towards the third-trimester things got even more complicated with restless leg syndrome (RLS) that is caused due to low Ferritin levels, Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) rash that caused a severe allergic reaction around the belly, and obstructive cholestasis that causes a severe itch around the leg. Through all of these difficulties, we could persevere because of Dr. Poornima\u2019s, patience, ability to go to the root of the problems quickly and advising appropriate medical supervision. Her pleasant and calm demeneour always gave us confidence.  Due to the high-risk nature of this pregnancy, we went for C-Sec and were blessed with our child. Looking back the journey was certainly scary but this seemingly impossible journey was possible only because of Dr. Poornima. We can't express our gratitude enough for the happiness that we have with us today.",

Very patiently she resolved my all doubts and queries and also with very limited medications. she is the doc who believes in self cure and she suggested me the same rather only depending upon medication. Finally the day came and I conceived.Initially I was not very sure if she is the right choice to continue with delivery and all (a normal human fear) but her response was really awesome. She guided me on each step and stages. And finally the big day came. I was full of fear and all but seeing her smiling face I really could get some confidence that I am in safe hands. I had gastational daibeties and hence normal delivery was complicated in that case. From the beginning she told me that don't make any mindset/perception. And finally with her lots of efforts (which I can't explain here in words), I delivered a  baby that too with normal delivery :) I am really thankful to that God whom I can't see and equally thankful and obliged to the God whom I can interact...Dr Poornima. Today I am happy mother with healthy baby.",

Both Mom and kid are doing good without any complications. Thanks to Dr Poornima for supporting the Normal delivery as per our wish. However overall our experience at cloudnine Whitefield was horrible and I am listing a few instances here,\n\nNurses \u2013 The capability of supporting nurses is not up to the expectations per our experience, an example - the nurses did not bother to connect the NST device properly (that checks the baby heartbeat and pain before labour) until I noticed and informed them.\nThe nurses did not come at regular time/ or instruct upfront on the medications, a few time we had to call them to check (like tablets to take before food/after food)\nThe Duty doctor was very arrogant (on duty 13th Jul\u201921 nigh) \u2013 When we enquired if my wife could get Epidural because the pain at some point was intolerable, she commented sarcastically like you want a normal delivery without any pain huh?\nThe nurse as well apparently told duty doctor that we have been telling them how to use the devices (from point#1) the duty doctor then shouted at me & my wife that nurses know how to use devices better than us et.al, It would have made some sense if duty doctor had the mind to understood the problem that we tried to point out about the nurses..\nThe duty doctor also mentioned that she has been tired of treating many patient throughout night.. however for us it\u2019s our only baby and delivery for lifetime, if she is tired of work she should probably inform her superior doctors et.al and not use the patient /my wife to relive all the anger, who is been at the peak of labor, just for asking if epidural could be administered!!\nThe duty doctor than called the gynecologist(Dr. Poornima gowda) and told that we are demanding for epidural et.al which we never did (we did enquire but did NOT demand), obviously she was trying to make some points on her side..\nAfter the delivery my wife was still in tears because of the way the duty doctor mentally harassed her while she was in labor room..\nIt was not over yet.. the nurses gave bath to my wife in cold water(at 6:30am), when she said the water is very cold, the nurse threw the mug away and kept her waiting.. can\u2019t further describe..\nYes, as patients we may ask more questions in a critical time(because it\u2019s one time instance in life and the fear of unknowns) but it was the responsibility of the doctor to handle and not yell/scold the patient at that time.\nI still respect the work the duty doctor did along with Gynecologist and delivered our kid through normal delivery but I believe that does not entitle them to treat us the way they want or the mood they are in..\nWe had our first kid delivered at ovum hospital which was a very pleasant experience throughout and we had to choose Cloudnine hospital this time because we relocated to Whitefield, A decision that we will regret for lifetime..\n\n",

She looked into complete medical history one by one and helped us to understand all our details. I already had 3 miscarriages and quite trashed with it. I decided to go ahead another time and this time also in 7th week bleeding started, really emotionally challenging and breakdown situation. We rush to the hospital and loose all hope but by god's grace that day first time we booked appointment of Poornima mam. She listened me very patiently and understood my previous history and accordingly started my treatment. She explained very well why particular medicine and injections needs to be taken - how it will help along with tests (which we understood was quite important to minimize the complication) since my pregnancy was a high risk pregnancy with many complications. During pregnancy term, I faced lots of issues in 5th month with my placenta being low lying. In 7 months, Jaundice symptoms started which affected my whole body to itchy all the time but mam did not recommend any unwanted medicine and handled it very naturally. Considering all situations and due to high-risk pregnancy, my delivery was planned for the C- section and it was due on 11th Jan\u201922 but my water ruptured in 35 week 5 days. Mam waited to get pain started if I can deliver normal and she tried her best and my planned C section turned into Normal delivery. We are blessed with a baby girl on 6th Dec'21 and with all healthy vitals condition post-delivery. NO NICU required (which we were scared off).

Based on my experience of conducting vaginal delivery after a C section and as your wife was keen for vaginal delivery we waited till 38 weeks. As she developed gestational diabetes in the 9 th month, decided to proceed with an elective C section. As per the protocol Covid test was done. As she was already in the 39th week, we decided to proceed as per the planned date despite her Covid status. There was neither hurrying for delivery nor messing up of history as you are mentioning. Of course we wanted to take all Covid safety precautions as safety of healthcare professionals is also important. Let's not forget that this thing happened when 2nd wave of Covid was peaking in Bangalore and several hundred doctors & nurses in this country had already died due to pandemic. \n\n\nRegarding your comment on sticking to timelines, most of the time we are dealing with unscheduled emergencies and patients requiring extra care / time, which could delay OPD timings. Even if I start late sometimes, I never compromise on the care & attention given to individual patients.",

Doctor and the supporting staff humbly answered all our questions related to pregnancy even if we have asked n number of times. On the day of delivery,  my wife started getting labor pain at 11am in the morning, Dr.Poornima did wait patiently till evening to deliver the baby through normal delivery. \n\nThough we were in the peak of second wave of pandemic during our second trimester, hospital has made all necessary arrangements to feel more safe. \n\nOverall we had a wonderful experience at Cloudnine and with Dr.Poornima. I would highly recommend Dr.Poornima and Cloudnine whitefield for the kind of treatment they provide and the professionalism that they follow.",

I was detected with a rare genetic condition that accelerates blood clots and blocks the blood flow to the placenta. We lost our first pregnancy due to this reason which we did not know at that point in time. Things became clear after a prothrombin panel test which showed an MTHFR gene mutation. During the second pregnancy, I was put on a daily dosage of blood thinner throughout the term. Towards the third-trimester things got even more complicated with restless leg syndrome (RLS) that is caused due to low Ferritin levels, Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) rash that caused a severe allergic reaction around the belly, and obstructive cholestasis that causes a severe itch around the leg. Through all of these difficulties, we could persevere because of Dr. Poornima\u2019s, patience, ability to go to the root of the problems quickly and advising appropriate medical supervision. Her pleasant and calm demeneour always gave us confidence.  Due to the high-risk nature of this pregnancy, we went for C-Sec and were blessed with our child. Looking back the journey was certainly scary but this seemingly impossible journey was possible only because of Dr. Poornima. We can't express our gratitude enough for the happiness that we have with us today.",

Very patiently she resolved my all doubts and queries and also with very limited medications. she is the doc who believes in self cure and she suggested me the same rather only depending upon medication. Finally the day came and I conceived.Initially I was not very sure if she is the right choice to continue with delivery and all (a normal human fear) but her response was really awesome. She guided me on each step and stages. And finally the big day came. I was full of fear and all but seeing her smiling face I really could get some confidence that I am in safe hands. I had gastational daibeties and hence normal delivery was complicated in that case. From the beginning she told me that don't make any mindset/perception. And finally with her lots of efforts (which I can't explain here in words), I delivered a  baby that too with normal delivery :) I am really thankful to that God whom I can't see and equally thankful and obliged to the God whom I can interact...Dr Poornima. Today I am happy mother with healthy baby.",

It was nothing that she took a decision to deliver the baby soon since I came to the hospital with pain. She waited for the labour pain to reduce and she did the normal delivery only.

But Poornima ma'am's regular guidance during consultations and positivity helped me sail through. She advocates using natural methods and avoids prescribing medicines and tests unless required. She also explains very beautifully and a very good listener. Another good attribute which impressed me was, she relates how our ancestors used to handle pregnancy and childbirth and not everything which is considered advanced today is required or necessary. Finally, I had a normal delivery and the whole process was very smooth. My husband and I were also kept in the loop regarding all the progress and updates during the delivery process. She also kept encouraging and guiding me during my post-partum phase. Very thankful to her for everything.",

Because of B - ve second pregnancy our baby got anaemic in 7th month as ict test came positive and that time baby weight was only 1.5 kg then we were thinking about that we should go for delivery or not. But she helped and did the treatment and send us for the treatment in bfmc. Where they did the treatment and we passed the 8th month successfully and baby weight was 2.49 kg. Then in the 9th month is starting my wife water bag was broken then She suggested  us that. Now time has come and we can deliver the baby. No anemia symptoms and baby is healthy. So we blessed with a healthy baby boy. This happened because of the dr Poornima. My wife case was so much complex but she handled it very easily. Thank you Doctor.. so much love and blessings from our side. \nDetails: \nNitin Goyal* **********\nAyushi Goyal * **********\n",

One best thing is she will mention both pros and cons and clearly gives guidance keeping in view of our medical history.In the month of December, I had  elective C-section(since my first one was c-section) successfully and got delivered with baby girl.Overall my pregnancy journey was very very  smooth without any stress and I felt blessed to be in safe hands.Would highly recommend Dr.Poornima for pregnancy.Thank you very much Doctor for the support and treatment you had provided during this pregnancy tenure. Always grateful to you..",
