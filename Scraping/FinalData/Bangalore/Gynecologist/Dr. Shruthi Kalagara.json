I would highly recommend Dr. Shruthi to all women, and any time she is just a message away or call. She responds to all your doubts everything, let it be small doubts or big, she will reply to all queries.\n\nMine was first pregnancy and I had induced labour as I didn\u2019t get any pain after completing 39 weeks too. But I am happy to say I had normal delivery though it was induced. All thanks to Dr Shruthi . I had continuous support from her. She was really great. Once I thought as it is induced pregnancy I might end up getting caesarean, but I appreciate Doctors effort to ensure everything went smooth. Night I admitted to Natus and next day by noon I delivered with proper cervix dilate.  Dr Shruthi has all the patience to wait till the end not like other doctors who goes into a conclude of caesarean.\n\nThank you once again Dr Shruthi for all your talks and support in my pregnancy journey.\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a",

The first meeting itself she made me understood the process and gave me a confident. She was extremely friendly, without whom I would not be able to think of my labour journey. These times normal delivery is very rare. Though I told her to do c-section as I could not bare the contraction pain, but she believed in me and it was a successful normal delivery. Complete credit goes to Dr. Shruthi. \nShe was available whenever needed and has never ignored giving guidance post pregnancy. I\u2019m whole heartedly satisfied. \nThank you, Dr. Shruthi!!\n\n",

My AMH levels were very high than normal. She didn't bother to tell me measures to bring them under control. Neither she helped me to understand what measures I should be taking to regulate my PCOS nor she mentioned my PCOS. When I'm paying so much money to take up the tests recommended by her and her consultation fees, she could atleast share the problem areas she sees in my reports, if not possible on WhatsApp, I asked her whether I should visit clinic for better understanding (for that also she didn't respond). **** *** *********** * ****** ** **** ****** ******",

But I am happy to say I had normal delivery though it was induced. All thanks to Dr Shruthi . I had continuous support from her. She was really great. Once I thought as it is induced pregnancy I might end up getting caesarean, but I appreciate Doctors effort to ensure everything went smooth. Night I admitted to Natus and next day by noon I delivered with proper cervix dilate.  Dr Shruthi has all the patience to wait till the end not like other doctors who goes into a conclude of caesarean.\n\nThank you once again Dr Shruthi for all your talks and support in my pregnancy journey.\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a",

These times normal delivery is very rare. Though I told her to do c-section as I could not bare the contraction pain, but she believed in me and it was a successful normal delivery. Complete credit goes to Dr. Shruthi. \nShe was available whenever needed and has never ignored giving guidance post pregnancy. I\u2019m whole heartedly satisfied. \nThank you, Dr. Shruthi!!\n\n",

My AMH levels were very high than normal. She didn't bother to tell me measures to bring them under control. Neither she helped me to understand what measures I should be taking to regulate my PCOS nor she mentioned my PCOS. When I'm paying so much money to take up the tests recommended by her and her consultation fees, she could atleast share the problem areas she sees in my reports, if not possible on WhatsApp, I asked her whether I should visit clinic for better understanding (for that also she didn't respond). **** *** *********** * ****** ** **** ****** ******",
