The next day after surgery was able to do few activities very easily.. God bless her hands!! \nOnce you consult her, She really is there for you all the time.

She is on top of everything. She never recommends any test unnecessarily. There was always a positive vibe when we met her. Mine was a high risk pregnancy and she was the saviour . She was also reachable in WhatsApp. She is very very professional and knowledgeable . She was my go to Gynaecologist and will always be.

I can never thank enough Dr Dhivya for the help she provided. She was there to help on every urgency, sometime late night calls, sometime on whatsapp. But she always replied on time with best advise. She also performed C section for my wife and gave importance guidance even post-delivery.\n\nShe was recommended by my friend, and it was the best decision I ever made. She always spends time with the patient, and answers all the questions. My previous doctor was very famous doctor, but she was always in hurry, and was not spending required time/attention. This encouraged me to change the doctor and I am very lucky that I chose Dr Dhivya. IF you really want a doctor who care for you like a family, go for Dr Dhivya.",

The next day after surgery was able to do few activities very easily.. God bless her hands!! \nOnce you consult her, She really is there for you all the time. I really mean it she responds to our calls and messages every single time without delay. Never seen a doc like that in my life.\nI'm extremely grateful to deliver my child with her.",

She is on top of everything. She never recommends any test unnecessarily. There was always a positive vibe when we met her. Mine was a high risk pregnancy and she was the saviour . She was also reachable in WhatsApp. She is very very professional and knowledgeable . She was my go to Gynaecologist and will always be.

I can never thank enough Dr Dhivya for the help she provided. She was there to help on every urgency, sometime late night calls, sometime on whatsapp. But she always replied on time with best advise. She also performed C section for my wife and gave importance guidance even post-delivery.\n\nShe was recommended by my friend, and it was the best decision I ever made. She always spends time with the patient, and answers all the questions. My previous doctor was very famous doctor, but she was always in hurry, and was not spending required time/attention. This encouraged me to change the doctor and I am very lucky that I chose Dr Dhivya. IF you really want a doctor who care for you like a family, go for Dr Dhivya.",

I came to know about Doctor Divya from one of my friend who was also getting treated by Doc Divya itself. After multiple follow up and consultation I realised she had indeed met my expectation. For all regular queries and any health issue I used to send message to Doctor Divya on wats app and she used to respond me without fail . I shall always be grateful to Doctor Divya because despite of having complicated pregnancy, she had helped me to successfully delivered a baby and today I\u2019m a proud mother of baby girl. Additionally  she counselled me well for my  postpartum depression as well.   Thank you so much !! ",

She is very friendly and  keen diagnosis, all the small symptoms shown in pregnancy are neglected during my first pregnancy was clearly diagnosed this time and treated properly. As she predicted, I had early labor, and she bore all the drama i did during my delivery and made me feel confident and have vaginal birth without epidural. Though I had so many pregnancy complications like low hb, pelvic griddle pain, lft, she took all precautions during my labor, literally made my delivery and post delivery recovery as easy one. ",

She is a very friendly and down to earth person. Didn't mention just for review but she does  followed up with us even when my wife had forgotten an appointment during critical times and even after delivery.",

I am the kind of person who asks a lot of questions and she has great evidence based knowledge and explains everything patiently. later she took care of me through out my pre natal period, delivery and post natal period. She answers queries through phone calls and messages too which is very helpful. She is precautious too but doesn\u2019t advise you to do any tests unnecessarily. Overall, a great find amongst the doctors here.  The best part is that she guides us exactly on what to do and expect. ",
