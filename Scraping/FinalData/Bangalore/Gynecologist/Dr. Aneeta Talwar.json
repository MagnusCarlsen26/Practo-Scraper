While all other doctors, I consulted for second third opinions literally freaked out looking a the size of the fibroid, Dr. Talwar was confident that it can be treated well and I am happy to say that she did an amazing job. Explained all the possible precautions and risks very well. The second time I went to see her was for my pregnancy. I delivered a baby in 2024. My experience for those 38 weeks was nothing but phenomenal.  It was a high risk pregnancy and she did her best to be ahead of those risks.She is very efficient at her job and does whatever is the best treatment for her patients. The best part about consulting her is that she won't sugar-coat situations. Instead she will be straightforward, practical and objective in her treatment. I am really thankful to her for the kind of emotional support she provided me during my delivery and myomectomy in the OT. She is an amazing and wonderful doctor. Thank you Dr. Aneeta Talwar for being so objective, detailed, practical, result oriented and thorough.",

Dr. Aneeta Talwar listens patiently, reviews your profile in detail, will advise only necessary tests, and share her recommended treatment. Her recommendation has always worked the best for me. \nI went through an open myomectomy in 2017. It was a major 3.5 hours surgery. The surgery went very well without any complications and medication was also completed within a week of discharge. In 2019, I delivered a baby in a different location through c-section. My gynaecologist here said, \u201cMyomectomy was done excellently. One couldn\u2019t see and tell that such a major surgery had been performed as the scars were minimal during the previous surgery or healed very well.\u201d She went on to say that she had never seen such an exceptional surgical work and the complications she was expecting didn\u2019t occur due to this. \n\nI am so glad to have been initially referred to Dr. Aneeta - it was a blessing as it not only resolved the earlier issue but also prevented any long-term complications.

While all other doctors, I consulted for second third opinions literally freaked out looking a the size of the fibroid, Dr. Talwar was confident that it can be treated well and I am happy to say that she did an amazing job. Explained all the possible precautions and risks very well. The second time I went to see her was for my pregnancy. I delivered a baby in 2024. My experience for those 38 weeks was nothing but phenomenal.  It was a high risk pregnancy and she did her best to be ahead of those risks.She is very efficient at her job and does whatever is the best treatment for her patients. The best part about consulting her is that she won't sugar-coat situations. Instead she will be straightforward, practical and objective in her treatment. I am really thankful to her for the kind of emotional support she provided me during my delivery and myomectomy in the OT. She is an amazing and wonderful doctor. Thank you Dr. Aneeta Talwar for being so objective, detailed, practical, result oriented and thorough.",

Dr. Aneeta Talwar listens patiently, reviews your profile in detail, will advise only necessary tests, and share her recommended treatment. Her recommendation has always worked the best for me. \nI went through an open myomectomy in 2017. It was a major 3.5 hours surgery. The surgery went very well without any complications and medication was also completed within a week of discharge. In 2019, I delivered a baby in a different location through c-section. My gynaecologist here said, \u201cMyomectomy was done excellently. One couldn\u2019t see and tell that such a major surgery had been performed as the scars were minimal during the previous surgery or healed very well.\u201d She went on to say that she had never seen such an exceptional surgical work and the complications she was expecting didn\u2019t occur due to this. \n\nI am so glad to have been initially referred to Dr. Aneeta - it was a blessing as it not only resolved the earlier issue but also prevented any long-term complications.
