After doing our research we ended up in motherhood  Hospital and got a recommendation of Dr Ayesha Gulzar, she was exactly what we needed and she knew exactly what she was doing. She guided me through out my pregnancy and she was super comforting. She is one of the finest doctors I\u2019ve ever seen. Any time u can contact her through WhatsApp or call and she is available. As it\u2019s my first pregnancy I had too many silly questions but Ma\u2019am had all the patience to answer it. She treated me like her own kid.. the way she was pampering me throughout my pregnancy I was really happy and super comfortable. \nAs a mother now I would like to say if you guys are looking out for the best gynaecologist in Bangalore then I would Highly recommend Dr. Ayesha Gulzar. She is available in Ovum Hospital now.. ",
