I was worried about finding the best doctor near my location in blr because I had my 6-month pregnancy checkup done in Dubai. when I needed to arrange my delivery while searching on Practo for a doctor, I found Dr. Manjula ma'am .  I have been getting my check-ups done by Manjula ma'am since the 7th month of my pregnancy. She is not only a very good doctor but also a very kind person. Ma'am induced me at 8:30 pm on 7th may and the whole night I was in pain but she is available all the time also she called to duty Dr. And asking for updates for my progress of giving birth.\nI remember when I was in the labor room in pain, I kept asking for a C-section, but ma'am motivated me and said, \"What's the use of enduring labor pain for so long if we end up with a C-section anyway?\" She motivated me again to try for a normal delivery. I had lost hope of having a normal delivery due to weight gain, low water level. but ma'am motivated me, and finally, I had a normal delivery and on 8th May, I gave birth and was blessed with baby girl.\nThank you, ma'am.",

Her popularity has grown purely due to the care and dedication she has shown to each one of her patients. Cloudnine is lucky to have such an amazing Doctor on board with them and she is a true asset to this organization. We were blessed with our Son in April of 2024 and Dr Manjula\u2019s made it so easy and memorable for us again.  A big thank you to Dr Manjula and her amazing team. Dr Manjula is our Guardian Angel. Thank you again for all that you do. ",

I had a cardiomyopathy issue from my childhood. I got married nd immediately got pregnant. But many doctors advised strictly against pregnancy since it was very risky for my life nd not to continue further. So two times we terminated the baby within 50days of pregnancy. I was very depressed and longing badly for a child in our life. By God's grace we were shifted to Bangalore because of my husband's job nd came to know about Dr.Manjula mam. I got pregnant third time nd visited mam. At the first visit itself she was very positive nd gave us so much confidence nd she was ready to take the risk along with us. She really took all the great efforts to make everything in a very positive nd smooth way nd she referred a cardiologist who is a friend of her. Everything was very smooth throughout out my pregnancy till delivery and finally delivered a baby boy at 37 weeks via c section since it was risky to have a normal delivery. Then after a year we shifted back to our native. I got pregnant again when my son was 1.3yrs old. I was very scared and not in a mentality to visit any doctors there.\n\n So we immediately called Dr.Manjula mam. We consulted with her virtually till my 5th month but this time it was not a smooth journey. I developed many symptoms like breathlessness, chest pain, high palpitations, etc. So we visited her directly after a long 8hrs journey. But as soon as we met her we got that positivity again in our hearts. Our cardiologist was very upset nd not much happy to continue this pregnancy since my health was not good. But mam gave us lots of hope nd try to get everything positive. She asked us to come at 32 weeks and stay there in Bangalore itself till delivery. She doesn't wish to continue my pregnancy beyond 34 weeks due to my negative ECG nd holter reports. So she asked us to admit immediately at 34 weeks that too not in cloudnine but at the nearby hospital because of the ICU and cardio facilities available there. She literally took more efforts for everything to be very safe nd she was very conscious in arranging all the doctors and procedures in a pre-planned manner. I finally delivered a baby girl at August 17th 2022 but my baby was kept in NICU for 4 days. But with God's grace and Mam's support we were ready to get back to our home. Dr.Manjula mam is really a God sent Angel to us nd we never met such a doctor in our life. She is a true gem of a human being. We love her so much nd am missing her badly. We were longing for one baby but now we are blessed with two both boy and girl. Manjula mam is such a friendly positive energetic smiling doctor. We recommend her 200%. Sorry for the long story. With so much love from Fahima Faizal.",

I was very depressed and longing badly for a child in our life. By God's grace we were shifted to Bangalore because of my husband's job nd came to know about Dr.Manjula mam. I got pregnant third time nd visited mam. At the first visit itself she was very positive nd gave us so much confidence nd she was ready to take the risk along with us. She really took all the great efforts to make everything in a very positive nd smooth way nd she referred a cardiologist who is a friend of her. Everything was very smooth throughout out my pregnancy till delivery and finally delivered a baby boy at 37 weeks via c section since it was risky to have a normal delivery. Then after a year we shifted back to our native. I got pregnant again when my son was 1.3yrs old. I was very scared and not in a mentality to visit any doctors there. So we immediately called Dr.Manjula mam. We consulted with her virtually till my 5th month but this time it was not a smooth journey. I developed many symptoms like breathlessness, chest pain, high palpitations, etc. So we visited her directly after a long 8hrs journey. But as soon as we met her we got that positivity again in our hearts. Our cardiologist was very upset nd not much happy to continue this pregnancy since my health was not good. But mam gave us lots of hope nd try to get everything positive. She asked us to come at 32 weeks and stay there in Bangalore itself till delivery. She doesn't wish to continue my pregnancy beyond 34 weeks due to my negative ECG nd holter reports. So she asked us to admit immediately at 34 weeks that too not in cloudnine but at the nearby hospital because of the ICU and cardio facilities available there. She literally took more efforts for everything to be very safe nd she was very conscious in arranging all the doctors and procedures in a pre-planned manner. I finally delivered a baby girl at August 17th 2022 but my baby was kept in NICU for 4 days. But with God's grace and Mam's support we were ready to get back to our home. Dr.Manjula mam is really a God sent Angel to us nd we never met such a doctor in our life. She is a true gem of a human being. We love her so much nd am missing her badly. We were longing for one baby but now we are blessed with two both boy and girl. Manjula mam is such a friendly positive energetic smiling doctor. We recommend her 200%. Sorry for the long story. With so much love from Fahima Faizal.",

                "review_text": "Dr. Manjula Deepak Mam is definitely a God-sent angel. She carries positive vibes and I would definitely recommend her for any Gynecology consultations. After having two recurrent miscarriages, we were so shattered and lost hope. But it\u2019s because of her best treatment and true support that we are happy parents to a lovely baby girl.\n\nHere is our story:\n\nIt was at the end of 2019, after going through 2 recurrent miscarriages, that we got to know about Dr. Manjula Deepak Mam from a close friend. We immediately booked a consultation and visited her at Cloud Nine HRBR Layout. On our first visit, she looked (that was the only time) at all our history and lab reports, and patiently listened to us. On our next visit, we were surprised to see that she remembered every single piece of information about my history and she ensured that she provided only the best care and treatment.\n\nThen comes COVID in early 2020. We moved to our hometown, gave ourselves a break, and didn't see a doctor for close to a year. We again planned to resume and mentally prepare for pregnancy around mid-2021. We booked an online video consultation with Dr. Manjula Deepak without hesitation, and you wouldn't believe it, even though we connected with her after a year, she remembered every detail and didn't make me feel any less disconnected, and we resumed from where we left off almost a year ago. The doctor helped me with the next set of plans and diets. She deserves a huge amount of respect for her dedication and for being so passionate about her profession and providing personal attention to every single patient.\n\nI was pregnant again and immediately booked the next video consultation with the doctor. Although all this happened virtually, she ensured I was given the best care and attention and prescribed the medicines to get started with.\n\nWe moved back to Bangalore in November 2021 for our future consultations and visited the doctor at the hospital. From then on, it was like a big relief and we were so confident that we had got Manjula Deepak Mam with us. Due to previous complications, we used to be nervous whenever there was a scan, and for everything small, I used to message Mam, as I was afraid that something might go wrong. She replied to each and every question on message without any irritation, even though she was always super busy. It was a high-risk pregnancy, but she handled it very smoothly. Mam is always calm and positive, and some days, though she is awake the whole night for emergency delivery, when we visit her in the morning for consultations, she will be with the same beautiful smile and positivity. She told us that this time we would hold our baby in our hands and it came true.\n\nShe was so particular and conscious enough that there were no chances of uncertainties by closely monitoring the pregnancy at more frequent intervals, giving us much needed moral support and strength, making us stay positive throughout.\n\nFinally, the day arrived. The doctor informed us well in advance about the delivery process, and we were asked to get admitted. I was induced by night and Mam informed the duty doctors to keep monitoring the baby's heartbeat and to inform her about my status, and she assured me if there was any urgency she would be there in 5 mins in hospital. She was frequently checking on my status that night and the next morning, we were blessed with a little angel . In the labor room, she was so supportive. Her words made me feel better when I was in so much pain.\n\nPregnancy is definitely a smooth journey with a wonderful human being like Dr. Manjula Deepak Mam. I miss visiting Mam in the hospital. She is a very down-to-earth person, and she talks to you like your sister and friend. We can\u2019t thank Mam enough for all her efforts. This is the shortest I could write about Mam.",

My friend had a NVD. We(Chaitra and Joseph) consulted the doctor in cloudnine hospital. We were satisfied and happy after meeting the doctor. Doctor was very friendly. she explained the growth of the baby very well during each and every consultation. Dr Manjula is a Gynaec cum fitness doctor :) she makes sure mother and baby are healthy. My pregnancy journey went very smoothly because of the doctor. Just follow her advices and everything will be fine. Doctor does her best. Doctor is very Proactive any time we message her she responds immediately,always available.I have not come across this kind of doctor till date. Dr Manjula is young and energetic doctor and treats patients well. I like doctors dressingsense.I like the way she calls my name. She remembers patients so well. She calls me by name when ever she sees me outside. I liked this a lot. Dr Manjula connects with patients in a very friendly manner.On the D-Day(Thursday) Doctor ruptured my membrane and told me that I'll deliver in a weeks time and after 2days my water bag broke and called the doctor around 2:30AM(Saturday) and explained the symptoms and Dr told it was water break and to carry my bag and go to hospital. Doctor informed me that she'll inform the duty doctor. I reached hospital by 2:45AM and Duty doctor was waiting for me and after check up she confirmed that it was a water break and induced pain. Dr Manjula came to see me around 7AM(Sunday) and told me that I'm progressing well and I'll deliver very soon. I was not able to bare pain and asked for epidural or to do C section. Dr convinced me and my husband to go for normal delivery. I was taken to Labor room by 8:45 and around 9:15 duty doctor was able to feel my Babys head they immediately called Dr Manjula. (Doctor was at home as it was a Sunday). Dr Manjula came in 5mins and by 9:30 i delivered a beautiful Princess.It was all possible because of Dr Manjula Deepak. I would like to thank God and my friend who referred the Doctor. I dont have words to express the way i feel for the doctor. Dr Manjula was the first person to touch my little pincess and bought her safely to this world. I want my princess also to become a doctor like Majula Deepak. If you are consulting Dr Manjula Deepak means you are in Safe hands. Any one can blindly trust the doctor. She does her job beyond her service. I would strongly recommend Dr Manjula Deepak to others.",

                "review_text": "First of all, I would say a BIG THANK YOU to Manjula mam. She is among the best doctor in Obstetrics and Gynaecology and always tries for a normal delivery unless there is anything serious and does the best possible treatment. I recommend everyone to consult her without a second thought in mind.\u00a0Once you visit her, you will get to know that you are in a safe\u00a0and the\u00a0best hand and will never regret it.\u00a0\n\nWe are blessed with a baby through a normal delivery even after my wife was running on insulin since she got gestational diabetes at the end of 3rd month of pregnancy. I have a long story that I am going to describe\u00a0below which may be useful for others.\n\nWe had consulted Dr. Manjula Deepak first time after the completion of about 3 months of my wife's first pregnancy. Before this, we had consulted two more doctors in Bengaluru but were not satisfied because they\u00a0were not allowing husbands to talk to the doctor (I understand it was covid time, but still husbands should also meet the doctors), not describing everything in detail, and not answering all the question. We had many questions since it was the first pregnancy. I did google and found Dr. Manjula Deepak with many good reviews and decided to consult her.\nComing to our story, Our first baby was having multiple abnormalities which were identified by Dr. Manjula mam and her team (Dr. Kavyashree KS) at the time of the anomaly scan. It was very shocking for us\u00a0and hard to believe. But the doctor wanted to have a second opinion before taking any further steps because it was critical and referred us to Bangalore Fetal Medicine Centre (BFMC). We went to BFMC and found there were some patients having similar or another type\u00a0of criticality in their pregnancy\u00a0and were referred to BFMC for a second opinion from many well-known hospitals. Doctors in BFMC did an anomaly scan for my wife and they too found the same issue and suggested aborting the baby because it was not easy for the baby to survive in this world or there were high chances to have more complications in the future. BFMC doctors\u00a0explained the whole thing in more detail and answered all of our questions. We headed back to mam with the BFMC reports and she also suggested abortion and gave us time for a few days to make the final decision. In the meantime, I did some research on google, checked with some other sources, consulted families and friends, etc because it was not easy for us to abort our first baby and finally we decided to go with the doctor's suggestion. My wife got admitted and the doctor did an abortion. I saw the baby and it was the same as presented in the anomaly scan report. It was the most painful day of our life.\u00a0\n\nWe consulted Manjula mam after some days and were worried that will it be similar if we plan for the next child? She told us it happens sometimes and is very rare. She recommended planning for the next baby after three months and don't think much about these things. She gave us enough confidence to plan for the next baby and promised that she will be giving us a healthy baby this time and will take care of everything\u00a0from the beginning itself.\n\nGood news came after eight or nine months and we consulted with Dr. Manjula mam and did whatever she suggested and continued consulting her. Everything went normal but after the completion of the 3rd month, my wife got Gestational Diabetes and the doctor told us that we should control\u00a0this until delivery by diet, physical activities, or insulin if required. Else it may impact the growth of the baby. Again we got shocked and trusted the doctor and followed her advice since we got\u00a0enough faith in her by this time. She referred us to a Dietician and an\u00a0Endocrinologist to control sugar levels. My wife did the same and was in observation\u00a0by her, Dietician, and Endocrinologist.\u00a0\n\nNow the time came for the anomaly\u00a0scan and we visited the same doctor Kavyashree KS who was aware of our past. We were so much scared and were praying to god at the time of the scan. I thanked a lot\u00a0to god and the doctors when we got the report and felt very happy,\u00a0everything\u00a0was normal. We continued following up with the doctor and Endocrinologist.\nAt around the 7th month of pregnancy, we moved to another doctor (don't want to name her\u00a0here,\u00a0but I will refer to her\u00a0as ABC) due to some financial issues. Whenever\u00a0we consulted ABC, she use to give us a lot of tension, used to scare us and never thought about the normal delivery, and always\u00a0suggested\u00a0a C section, else there may be a risk for the baby. We continued consulting with ABC up to about the 9th month and were worried about the ABC's words she use to speak at the time of consultation, we were getting sleepless nights.\u00a0\n\nFinally, we decided to consult Dr. Manjula Deepak again and went to her and explained\u00a0everything. She was too polite and understood our situation and convinced us that there is\u00a0nothing to worry about and everything is under control. She told me 95% of the chances are there that she will do a normal delivery and rest upon God (We too agreed here). I told her, mam do whatever you feel the best, I left everything to her and she was the next person after God for us.\nSince my wife was on insulin due to Gestational Diabetes, Dr. Manjula mam had to plan delivery before the due date by inducing pain. We planned for this and did accordingly. Delivery was not very easy and that took so much effort from\u00a0mam's side. She was very calm and active during the whole process. There was a time when even I thought of saying the doctor to go for a C section, but I already had left everything on mam and was knowing that she will be performing her best and finally, we are blessed with a healthy baby. Tears came to my eyes and I thanked a lot\u00a0Dr. Manjula mam and God for blessing us with the baby.\u00a0\n\nI am 100% sure that if it was any other doctor, definitely\u00a0it was done through a C section.\n\nNow I am very happy with my kid and my wife!!! Again credit goes to Dr. Manjula mam!!!",

She is very humble, caring, down to earth and would make you feel absolutely comfortable right from the very first visit. I must say, she's super beautiful too. \nMy pregnancy journey was quite rough. This was also my first pregnancy. I had severe nausea/vomiting & heartburn since the start of my pregnancy due to which I faced severe gastric problems. Dr. Manjula would always reply to my queries on WatsApp almost immediately.  At times, late in the evening/ night i would require medical attention as I would go through terrible stomach pains. Dr.Manjula would answer my calls every time and patiently guide me. She would also call the duty doctor @cloudnine and instruct as to what needs to be done upon my arrival. \nIn my 7th month of pregnancy, i had to face my nightmare. I became Covid19 positive. Words cannot express my fear as to what was going to happen in the coming days. I was so scared of losing my baby, but Dr.Manjula gave me a lot of strength and positivity. Even during those critical times, Dr.Manjula has been a great support to me and my family. She guided me to get admitted to another hospital and was also in constant touch with the doctors there monitoring my medicines. By God's grace I recoverd and my baby was also fine in my womb. \nI was 36 weeks pregnant when my water broke unexpectedly on Dec 2nd 2020 early morning around 3 am. I was very weak after all that i had been through previously. I was prepared for a C-section mentally. Me and my husband rushed to Cloudnine. I was examined and labour was induced at around 4:30 am. I had silently dropped a message on WhatsApp mentioning the situation and that I was there at the hospital. Dr.Manjula was there at the hospital at around 6:30 am. Upon seeing her, there was a sense of relief and i knew she would take care of me & the entire situation. Dr.Manjula and her team were so supportive & encouraging throughout my labour while i screaming and crying in excruciating pain.  I have a very low tolerance to pain. But, I went with the flow and delivered a beautiful girl baby at 1:41 pm Dec 2nd 2020. It was a normal delivery. My baby was born sunny side up. I didnt have faith in me that it was going to be an NVD. In fact no one did even in my family, but Dr.Manjula made it happen. I guess she believed in me. \n\nAm so glad that God chose Dr.Manjula to be my doctor. I can't thank her enough for giving me my miracle baby in my hands. \nGod bless her and her beautiful family. \u2764\ufe0f\nFrom the bottom of hearts, Thank You Doctor \ud83d\ude0a.\n- Mary & Robert\n\n\n",

                "review_text": "My wife (Arpita) has been seeing Dr Manjula since April this year from the very beginning of her pregnancy. We got to know about her pregnancy right in the middle of the National Lockdown. My wife was very tense because of the COVID situation at that point in time and we were unsure how things will pan out. We did an online check of various gynecologists and obstetricians across Bangalore on Practo and other websites and came across Dr Manjula\u2019s profile. We were amazed at her rating (100%) with over 700 reviews. What was also incredible was that almost 80% of those who gave ratings shared their stories. We did not find any other gynecologist across Bangalore who had a 100% rating along with such high number of reviews. Even most of the renowned doctors had 97-98% rating but 100% rating was unheard of. We were quite curious and we decided to visit her, even though the Cloudnine HRBR branch where she is based is relatively far from our place. \nAfter first few visits, we slowly figured out the reasons for her perfect ratings. Dr Manjula came across as a very friendly, polite and patient person. But the thing that stands out about her is her relaxed attitude. She will put her patients at ease and remove all stress and tension. She does not prescribe any unnecessary tests or medicines and tries her best to ensure that the pregnancy follows a natural path. Throughout the pregnancy, my wife had frequent bouts of nausea and vomiting, but the doctor assured her that it was normal and not to be worried at all. She encourages positivity all the time. My wife had lot of questions (especially since it was her first pregnancy), but the doctor answered all of them patiently. She even gave her watsapp number. My wife used to get her doubts and queries clarified from time to time on watsapp and invariably the doctor would always reply in spite of her busy schedule. \nCouple of more things I would like to mention about Dr Manjula. She remembers all her patients by name (which I find quite incredible given that she would be meeting several new patients every week). Also, she has a very good rapport with her staff. She treats them and talks to them as her equal (just like talking to a friend). This is a rare quality and shows that she is humble, kind and has a great soul. I could see the kind of respect all the staff members had for her. \nIn the middle of her pregnancy, my wife was thinking of going to her home town in Kolkata for couple of months. Doctor gave her the go ahead and also provided a fit to fly certificate. After 2 months just before my wife was expected to fly back, we had a discussion of whether the delivery should happen in Kolkata or Bangalore. However, we decided that it was best for her to come back mainly because of the confidence we had in Dr Manjula. After coming back, my wife underwent a CBC test and her hemoglobin came quite low (8.4). Dr Manjula suggested her to take 2 doses of iron infusion. After taking those doses, her hemoglobin went up to 11.2 in a month\u2019s time. \nDuring the last scan, my wife was detected with polyhydramnios (very high levels of amniotic fluid) which occurs in just 1% pregnancies. We were quite worried on hearing this but Dr Manjula spent significant amount of time with us, calmed us down and assured us that my wife and our baby were in safe hands and there was nothing to worry. She suggested that we will need to go for Caesarian (because of the polyhydramnios) and it needed to be done within a week. She even gave us the option of choosing the date and time. She clarified all our doubts, laid to rest all our concerns and explained us the entire process of admission and operation. She also assured us that even if there was any emergency at any time before the day of operation, we could just walk in and get admitted and she will come over immediately (Dr Manjula stays just 5 minutes away from the hospital). We went back home satisfied. We chose the date and time of operation and intimated her. \nOn 30th Nov on the day of the operation, we reached the hospital early in the morning. All admission formalities were done smoothly and within couple of hours my wife was all set for the operation. In the operation theatre, as my wife was being administered anesthesia, she started sobbing uncontrollably as she got a bit scared. The doctor immediately comforted her and helped her to calm down. Soon she lost consciousness. In the middle of the operation, my wife just remembers hearing the words \u201cits a sweet baby girl\u201d. The operation went smoothly and baby was born healthy. \nWhen my wife was discharged after 3 days, she had mostly recovered. My wife recovered much faster compared to most people we know of. We believe strongly that this has more to do with the quality of her operation and doctor\u2019s encouragement to start getting active at the earliest. Dr Manjula called us back after a week, removed the dressing (which had almost healed) and explained to us clearly the way forward. Our next visit is scheduled after 6 months. \nOverall we had an overwhelming experience with Dr Manjula and we would like to thank her from the bottom of our heart for her guidance, advise, encouragement and everything she has done for my wife throughout this period. Most importantly, we would like to thank her for delivering to us the best gift of our life. We will be eternally grateful to her. \n",

I was worried about finding the best doctor near my location in blr because I had my 6-month pregnancy checkup done in Dubai. when I needed to arrange my delivery while searching on Practo for a doctor, I found Dr. Manjula ma'am .  I have been getting my check-ups done by Manjula ma'am since the 7th month of my pregnancy. She is not only a very good doctor but also a very kind person. Ma'am induced me at 8:30 pm on 7th may and the whole night I was in pain but she is available all the time also she called to duty Dr. And asking for updates for my progress of giving birth.\nI remember when I was in the labor room in pain, I kept asking for a C-section, but ma'am motivated me and said, \"What's the use of enduring labor pain for so long if we end up with a C-section anyway?\" She motivated me again to try for a normal delivery. I had lost hope of having a normal delivery due to weight gain, low water level. but ma'am motivated me, and finally, I had a normal delivery and on 8th May, I gave birth and was blessed with baby girl.\nThank you, ma'am.",

We had our Daughter in 2020 and I can see a huge growth in the number of patients consulting her now (and will only keep growing). Her popularity has grown purely due to the care and dedication she has shown to each one of her patients. Cloudnine is lucky to have such an amazing Doctor on board with them and she is a true asset to this organization. We were blessed with our Son in April of 2024 and Dr Manjula\u2019s made it so easy and memorable for us again.  A big thank you to Dr Manjula and her amazing team. Dr Manjula is our Guardian Angel. Thank you again for all that you do. ",

But many doctors advised strictly against pregnancy since it was very risky for my life nd not to continue further. So two times we terminated the baby within 50days of pregnancy. I was very depressed and longing badly for a child in our life. By God's grace we were shifted to Bangalore because of my husband's job nd came to know about Dr.Manjula mam. I got pregnant third time nd visited mam. At the first visit itself she was very positive nd gave us so much confidence nd she was ready to take the risk along with us. She really took all the great efforts to make everything in a very positive nd smooth way nd she referred a cardiologist who is a friend of her. Everything was very smooth throughout out my pregnancy till delivery and finally delivered a baby boy at 37 weeks via c section since it was risky to have a normal delivery. Then after a year we shifted back to our native. I got pregnant again when my son was 1.3yrs old. I was very scared and not in a mentality to visit any doctors there.\n\n So we immediately called Dr.Manjula mam. We consulted with her virtually till my 5th month but this time it was not a smooth journey. I developed many symptoms like breathlessness, chest pain, high palpitations, etc. So we visited her directly after a long 8hrs journey. But as soon as we met her we got that positivity again in our hearts. Our cardiologist was very upset nd not much happy to continue this pregnancy since my health was not good. But mam gave us lots of hope nd try to get everything positive. She asked us to come at 32 weeks and stay there in Bangalore itself till delivery. She doesn't wish to continue my pregnancy beyond 34 weeks due to my negative ECG nd holter reports. So she asked us to admit immediately at 34 weeks that too not in cloudnine but at the nearby hospital because of the ICU and cardio facilities available there. She literally took more efforts for everything to be very safe nd she was very conscious in arranging all the doctors and procedures in a pre-planned manner. I finally delivered a baby girl at August 17th 2022 but my baby was kept in NICU for 4 days. But with God's grace and Mam's support we were ready to get back to our home. Dr.Manjula mam is really a God sent Angel to us nd we never met such a doctor in our life. She is a true gem of a human being. We love her so much nd am missing her badly. We were longing for one baby but now we are blessed with two both boy and girl. Manjula mam is such a friendly positive energetic smiling doctor. We recommend her 200%. Sorry for the long story.

                "review_text": "Dr. Manjula Deepak Mam is definitely a God-sent angel. She carries positive vibes and I would definitely recommend her for any Gynecology consultations. After having two recurrent miscarriages, we were so shattered and lost hope. But it\u2019s because of her best treatment and true support that we are happy parents to a lovely baby girl.\n\nHere is our story:\n\nIt was at the end of 2019, after going through 2 recurrent miscarriages, that we got to know about Dr. Manjula Deepak Mam from a close friend. We immediately booked a consultation and visited her at Cloud Nine HRBR Layout. On our first visit, she looked (that was the only time) at all our history and lab reports, and patiently listened to us. On our next visit, we were surprised to see that she remembered every single piece of information about my history and she ensured that she provided only the best care and treatment.\n\nThen comes COVID in early 2020. We moved to our hometown, gave ourselves a break, and didn't see a doctor for close to a year. We again planned to resume and mentally prepare for pregnancy around mid-2021. We booked an online video consultation with Dr. Manjula Deepak without hesitation, and you wouldn't believe it, even though we connected with her after a year, she remembered every detail and didn't make me feel any less disconnected, and we resumed from where we left off almost a year ago. The doctor helped me with the next set of plans and diets. She deserves a huge amount of respect for her dedication and for being so passionate about her profession and providing personal attention to every single patient.\n\nI was pregnant again and immediately booked the next video consultation with the doctor. Although all this happened virtually, she ensured I was given the best care and attention and prescribed the medicines to get started with.\n\nWe moved back to Bangalore in November 2021 for our future consultations and visited the doctor at the hospital. From then on, it was like a big relief and we were so confident that we had got Manjula Deepak Mam with us. Due to previous complications, we used to be nervous whenever there was a scan, and for everything small, I used to message Mam, as I was afraid that something might go wrong. She replied to each and every question on message without any irritation, even though she was always super busy. It was a high-risk pregnancy, but she handled it very smoothly. Mam is always calm and positive, and some days, though she is awake the whole night for emergency delivery, when we visit her in the morning for consultations, she will be with the same beautiful smile and positivity. She told us that this time we would hold our baby in our hands and it came true.\n\nShe was so particular and conscious enough that there were no chances of uncertainties by closely monitoring the pregnancy at more frequent intervals, giving us much needed moral support and strength, making us stay positive throughout.\n\nFinally, the day arrived. The doctor informed us well in advance about the delivery process, and we were asked to get admitted. I was induced by night and Mam informed the duty doctors to keep monitoring the baby's heartbeat and to inform her about my status, and she assured me if there was any urgency she would be there in 5 mins in hospital. She was frequently checking on my status that night and the next morning, we were blessed with a little angel . In the labor room, she was so supportive. Her words made me feel better when I was in so much pain.\n\nPregnancy is definitely a smooth journey with a wonderful human being like Dr. Manjula Deepak Mam. I miss visiting Mam in the hospital. She is a very down-to-earth person, and she talks to you like your sister and friend. We can\u2019t thank Mam enough for all her efforts. This is the shortest I could write about Mam.",

My friend had a NVD. We(Chaitra and Joseph) consulted the doctor in cloudnine hospital. We were satisfied and happy after meeting the doctor. Doctor was very friendly. she explained the growth of the baby very well during each and every consultation. Dr Manjula is a Gynaec cum fitness doctor :) she makes sure mother and baby are healthy. My pregnancy journey went very smoothly because of the doctor. Just follow her advices and everything will be fine. Doctor does her best. Doctor is very Proactive any time we message her she responds immediately,always available.I have not come across this kind of doctor till date. Dr Manjula is young and energetic doctor and treats patients well. I like doctors dressingsense.I like the way she calls my name. She remembers patients so well. She calls me by name when ever she sees me outside. I liked this a lot. Dr Manjula connects with patients in a very friendly manner.On the D-Day(Thursday) Doctor ruptured my membrane and told me that I'll deliver in a weeks time and after 2days my water bag broke and called the doctor around 2:30AM(Saturday) and explained the symptoms and Dr told it was water break and to carry my bag and go to hospital. Doctor informed me that she'll inform the duty doctor. I reached hospital by 2:45AM and Duty doctor was waiting for me and after check up she confirmed that it was a water break and induced pain. Dr Manjula came to see me around 7AM(Sunday) and told me that I'm progressing well and I'll deliver very soon. I was not able to bare pain and asked for epidural or to do C section. Dr convinced me and my husband to go for normal delivery. I was taken to Labor room by 8:45 and around 9:15 duty doctor was able to feel my Babys head they immediately called Dr Manjula. (Doctor was at home as it was a Sunday). Dr Manjula came in 5mins and by 9:30 i delivered a beautiful Princess.It was all possible because of Dr Manjula Deepak. I would like to thank God and my friend who referred the Doctor. I dont have words to express the way i feel for the doctor. Dr Manjula was the first person to touch my little pincess and bought her safely to this world. I want my princess also to become a doctor like Majula Deepak. If you are consulting Dr Manjula Deepak means you are in Safe hands. Any one can blindly trust the doctor. She does her job beyond her service. I would strongly recommend Dr Manjula Deepak to others.",

                "id": 44638238,
                "review_text": "First of all, I would say a BIG THANK YOU to Manjula mam. She is among the best doctor in Obstetrics and Gynaecology and always tries for a normal delivery unless there is anything serious and does the best possible treatment. I recommend everyone to consult her without a second thought in mind.\u00a0Once you visit her, you will get to know that you are in a safe\u00a0and the\u00a0best hand and will never regret it.\u00a0\n\nWe are blessed with a baby through a normal delivery even after my wife was running on insulin since she got gestational diabetes at the end of 3rd month of pregnancy. I have a long story that I am going to describe\u00a0below which may be useful for others.\n\nWe had consulted Dr. Manjula Deepak first time after the completion of about 3 months of my wife's first pregnancy. Before this, we had consulted two more doctors in Bengaluru but were not satisfied because they\u00a0were not allowing husbands to talk to the doctor (I understand it was covid time, but still husbands should also meet the doctors), not describing everything in detail, and not answering all the question. We had many questions since it was the first pregnancy. I did google and found Dr. Manjula Deepak with many good reviews and decided to consult her.\nComing to our story, Our first baby was having multiple abnormalities which were identified by Dr. Manjula mam and her team (Dr. Kavyashree KS) at the time of the anomaly scan. It was very shocking for us\u00a0and hard to believe. But the doctor wanted to have a second opinion before taking any further steps because it was critical and referred us to Bangalore Fetal Medicine Centre (BFMC). We went to BFMC and found there were some patients having similar or another type\u00a0of criticality in their pregnancy\u00a0and were referred to BFMC for a second opinion from many well-known hospitals. Doctors in BFMC did an anomaly scan for my wife and they too found the same issue and suggested aborting the baby because it was not easy for the baby to survive in this world or there were high chances to have more complications in the future. BFMC doctors\u00a0explained the whole thing in more detail and answered all of our questions. We headed back to mam with the BFMC reports and she also suggested abortion and gave us time for a few days to make the final decision. In the meantime, I did some research on google, checked with some other sources, consulted families and friends, etc because it was not easy for us to abort our first baby and finally we decided to go with the doctor's suggestion. My wife got admitted and the doctor did an abortion. I saw the baby and it was the same as presented in the anomaly scan report. It was the most painful day of our life.\u00a0\n\nWe consulted Manjula mam after some days and were worried that will it be similar if we plan for the next child? She told us it happens sometimes and is very rare. She recommended planning for the next baby after three months and don't think much about these things. She gave us enough confidence to plan for the next baby and promised that she will be giving us a healthy baby this time and will take care of everything\u00a0from the beginning itself.\n\nGood news came after eight or nine months and we consulted with Dr. Manjula mam and did whatever she suggested and continued consulting her. Everything went normal but after the completion of the 3rd month, my wife got Gestational Diabetes and the doctor told us that we should control\u00a0this until delivery by diet, physical activities, or insulin if required. Else it may impact the growth of the baby. Again we got shocked and trusted the doctor and followed her advice since we got\u00a0enough faith in her by this time. She referred us to a Dietician and an\u00a0Endocrinologist to control sugar levels. My wife did the same and was in observation\u00a0by her, Dietician, and Endocrinologist.\u00a0\n\nNow the time came for the anomaly\u00a0scan and we visited the same doctor Kavyashree KS who was aware of our past. We were so much scared and were praying to god at the time of the scan. I thanked a lot\u00a0to god and the doctors when we got the report and felt very happy,\u00a0everything\u00a0was normal. We continued following up with the doctor and Endocrinologist.\nAt around the 7th month of pregnancy, we moved to another doctor (don't want to name her\u00a0here,\u00a0but I will refer to her\u00a0as ABC) due to some financial issues. Whenever\u00a0we consulted ABC, she use to give us a lot of tension, used to scare us and never thought about the normal delivery, and always\u00a0suggested\u00a0a C section, else there may be a risk for the baby. We continued consulting with ABC up to about the 9th month and were worried about the ABC's words she use to speak at the time of consultation, we were getting sleepless nights.\u00a0\n\nFinally, we decided to consult Dr. Manjula Deepak again and went to her and explained\u00a0everything. She was too polite and understood our situation and convinced us that there is\u00a0nothing to worry about and everything is under control. She told me 95% of the chances are there that she will do a normal delivery and rest upon God (We too agreed here). I told her, mam do whatever you feel the best, I left everything to her and she was the next person after God for us.\nSince my wife was on insulin due to Gestational Diabetes, Dr. Manjula mam had to plan delivery before the due date by inducing pain. We planned for this and did accordingly. Delivery was not very easy and that took so much effort from\u00a0mam's side. She was very calm and active during the whole process. There was a time when even I thought of saying the doctor to go for a C section, but I already had left everything on mam and was knowing that she will be performing her best and finally, we are blessed with a healthy baby. Tears came to my eyes and I thanked a lot\u00a0Dr. Manjula mam and God for blessing us with the baby.\u00a0\n\nI am 100% sure that if it was any other doctor, definitely\u00a0it was done through a C section.\n\nNow I am very happy with my kid and my wife!!! Again credit goes to Dr. Manjula mam!!!",

She is very humble, caring, down to earth and would make you feel absolutely comfortable right from the very first visit. I must say, she's super beautiful too. \nMy pregnancy journey was quite rough. This was also my first pregnancy. I had severe nausea/vomiting & heartburn since the start of my pregnancy due to which I faced severe gastric problems. Dr. Manjula would always reply to my queries on WatsApp almost immediately.  At times, late in the evening/ night i would require medical attention as I would go through terrible stomach pains. Dr.Manjula would answer my calls every time and patiently guide me. She would also call the duty doctor @cloudnine and instruct as to what needs to be done upon my arrival. \nIn my 7th month of pregnancy, i had to face my nightmare. I became Covid19 positive. Words cannot express my fear as to what was going to happen in the coming days. I was so scared of losing my baby, but Dr.Manjula gave me a lot of strength and positivity. Even during those critical times, Dr.Manjula has been a great support to me and my family. She guided me to get admitted to another hospital and was also in constant touch with the doctors there monitoring my medicines. By God's grace I recoverd and my baby was also fine in my womb. \nI was 36 weeks pregnant when my water broke unexpectedly on Dec 2nd 2020 early morning around 3 am. I was very weak after all that i had been through previously. I was prepared for a C-section mentally. Me and my husband rushed to Cloudnine. I was examined and labour was induced at around 4:30 am. I had silently dropped a message on WhatsApp mentioning the situation and that I was there at the hospital. Dr.Manjula was there at the hospital at around 6:30 am. Upon seeing her, there was a sense of relief and i knew she would take care of me & the entire situation. Dr.Manjula and her team were so supportive & encouraging throughout my labour while i screaming and crying in excruciating pain.  I have a very low tolerance to pain. But, I went with the flow and delivered a beautiful girl baby at 1:41 pm Dec 2nd 2020. It was a normal delivery. My baby was born sunny side up. I didnt have faith in me that it was going to be an NVD. In fact no one did even in my family, but Dr.Manjula made it happen. I guess she believed in me. \n\nAm so glad that God chose Dr.Manjula to be my doctor. I can't thank her enough for giving me my miracle baby in my hands. \nGod bless her and her beautiful family. \u2764\ufe0f\nFrom the bottom of hearts, Thank You Doctor \ud83d\ude0a.\n- Mary & Robert\n\n\n",

                "review_text": "My wife (Arpita) has been seeing Dr Manjula since April this year from the very beginning of her pregnancy. We got to know about her pregnancy right in the middle of the National Lockdown. My wife was very tense because of the COVID situation at that point in time and we were unsure how things will pan out. We did an online check of various gynecologists and obstetricians across Bangalore on Practo and other websites and came across Dr Manjula\u2019s profile. We were amazed at her rating (100%) with over 700 reviews. What was also incredible was that almost 80% of those who gave ratings shared their stories. We did not find any other gynecologist across Bangalore who had a 100% rating along with such high number of reviews. Even most of the renowned doctors had 97-98% rating but 100% rating was unheard of. We were quite curious and we decided to visit her, even though the Cloudnine HRBR branch where she is based is relatively far from our place. \nAfter first few visits, we slowly figured out the reasons for her perfect ratings. Dr Manjula came across as a very friendly, polite and patient person. But the thing that stands out about her is her relaxed attitude. She will put her patients at ease and remove all stress and tension. She does not prescribe any unnecessary tests or medicines and tries her best to ensure that the pregnancy follows a natural path. Throughout the pregnancy, my wife had frequent bouts of nausea and vomiting, but the doctor assured her that it was normal and not to be worried at all. She encourages positivity all the time. My wife had lot of questions (especially since it was her first pregnancy), but the doctor answered all of them patiently. She even gave her watsapp number. My wife used to get her doubts and queries clarified from time to time on watsapp and invariably the doctor would always reply in spite of her busy schedule. \nCouple of more things I would like to mention about Dr Manjula. She remembers all her patients by name (which I find quite incredible given that she would be meeting several new patients every week). Also, she has a very good rapport with her staff. She treats them and talks to them as her equal (just like talking to a friend). This is a rare quality and shows that she is humble, kind and has a great soul. I could see the kind of respect all the staff members had for her. \nIn the middle of her pregnancy, my wife was thinking of going to her home town in Kolkata for couple of months. Doctor gave her the go ahead and also provided a fit to fly certificate. After 2 months just before my wife was expected to fly back, we had a discussion of whether the delivery should happen in Kolkata or Bangalore. However, we decided that it was best for her to come back mainly because of the confidence we had in Dr Manjula. After coming back, my wife underwent a CBC test and her hemoglobin came quite low (8.4). Dr Manjula suggested her to take 2 doses of iron infusion. After taking those doses, her hemoglobin went up to 11.2 in a month\u2019s time. \nDuring the last scan, my wife was detected with polyhydramnios (very high levels of amniotic fluid) which occurs in just 1% pregnancies. We were quite worried on hearing this but Dr Manjula spent significant amount of time with us, calmed us down and assured us that my wife and our baby were in safe hands and there was nothing to worry. She suggested that we will need to go for Caesarian (because of the polyhydramnios) and it needed to be done within a week. She even gave us the option of choosing the date and time. She clarified all our doubts, laid to rest all our concerns and explained us the entire process of admission and operation. She also assured us that even if there was any emergency at any time before the day of operation, we could just walk in and get admitted and she will come over immediately (Dr Manjula stays just 5 minutes away from the hospital). We went back home satisfied. We chose the date and time of operation and intimated her. \nOn 30th Nov on the day of the operation, we reached the hospital early in the morning. All admission formalities were done smoothly and within couple of hours my wife was all set for the operation. In the operation theatre, as my wife was being administered anesthesia, she started sobbing uncontrollably as she got a bit scared. The doctor immediately comforted her and helped her to calm down. Soon she lost consciousness. In the middle of the operation, my wife just remembers hearing the words \u201cits a sweet baby girl\u201d. The operation went smoothly and baby was born healthy. \nWhen my wife was discharged after 3 days, she had mostly recovered. My wife recovered much faster compared to most people we know of. We believe strongly that this has more to do with the quality of her operation and doctor\u2019s encouragement to start getting active at the earliest. Dr Manjula called us back after a week, removed the dressing (which had almost healed) and explained to us clearly the way forward. Our next visit is scheduled after 6 months. \nOverall we had an overwhelming experience with Dr Manjula and we would like to thank her from the bottom of our heart for her guidance, advise, encouragement and everything she has done for my wife throughout this period. Most importantly, we would like to thank her for delivering to us the best gift of our life. We will be eternally grateful to her. \n",

Practo's most rated and reviewdd Gynaecologist is Dr. Manjula Deepak. Although she consults at Cloud Nine, HRBR Clinic - my husband and mom went from South Bangalore to show her my reports, and she was amazing. She listened to the whole of what was concerning all of us. And told exactly the same what other doctors had told ~ But in such a calm, pragmatic approach. I went to see her the other week and before that she would call me, take my health updates over whatsapp almost daily.  Told me to get (just the important ones) test and scans. And then only did I went to see her. First time did I come across a doctor who was not at all wanting me to travel or run here n there to avoid me getting stressed. \nIn my first n only appointment with  her, she asked me concerns of delaying the delivery when I know that such alarming BPz impact is well known to me. So mildly she counseled  me that waiting until the due date won't be feasible. Since my 8th month was running I was scared for delivery since it has been an old notion that babies have difficulty surviving if born in 8th month. Dr. Manjula has such positive vibes and the aura she creates in the room that you are bound to get affirmation to any situation getting better and under control. While me and my husband met her on one Saturday and took  leave promising her that we shall update her what we have decided. And the next Saturday I had sudden abruption. \nDr. Manjula told my husband over phone to rush me to Cloud Nine Jayanagar and she would reach there too. When I reached the hospital, the staff was all set to receive me and start with the emergency treatment and preparing me for Emergency LSCS (C section).  I am so glad that I was taken care like a Flower the moment I reached the hospital. Just like the doctor, the staff and others at hospital had priority as me and baby and not other formalities. \nSo my second meeting to Dr. Manjula Deepak was inside the Operation Theatre, with ever charming smile she carries, the calmness and positive approach. Within a span of half an hour, all was done and she told I had a miracle baby boy who had two rounds of umbilical cord around his head and a big clot was also found during delivery.    \n\nI have always feared doctors and visit to hospital but if its Dr. Manjula Deepak, I would say even a C section isn't a scary procedure to go through \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42.\n No count of words are enough to thank and express our gratitude to her. For me she was the Game  changer. We along with baby Agam shall everyday remember her for what contribution she has made to our lives is indispensable.\nThank you,\nBaby Agam \ud83d\udc76, Papa Amarjeet and Mama Gurdeep",

With that we almost in depression few yrs., not even thought to plan another baby coz of fearing we may land in same situation again.  \n\nFrom last few years we keep looking the reviews for best gynecologist\u2019s and hospitals in Bangalore, finally we got to know about the Dr Manjula Ma'm and her positive feedbacks. we almost read about her all the reviews in google and practo, surprised to see 900 plus positive comments and everyone has different problems but still they happy with Manjula Ma'm treatment. For us time came to visit Manjula Ma'm in 2021 October and the first consultation experience was good.  \n\nShe don\u2019t prescribe un necessary medicines or scans, she give lot of time to clarify all the doubts. We were having small issue during 7th month pregnancy and we are lucky enough to have Manjula Ma'm and she treated well in advance and everything went well. Being busy doctor, still she always available over the whatsapp/phone call and clarify even small query/concerns.\n\nHaving C-section first time, still Ma'm was positive for Normal on 2nd delivery and waited till 38th week to see if Normal is possible. We are lucky enough to start small contractions at 37W 6d early morning and informed Ma'm about the situation and she suggested to wait till afternoon and visit hospital (Ma'm was on Sick leave that day 26th May). Here is the situation shows how dedicated about her patients and profession, Ma'm was having some surgery for her throat on same day and she couldn't talk next 2 weeks of time :( and she discharged from hospital that day evening around 5.30PM. but still in that situation Ma'm came to hospital to see my wife around 8.30PM night and given great support (we worried after hearing her surgery and in that situation, what if another doctor attend how they treat and all. she has talked with her assistant doctor and asked her to wait till night and make sure we feel comfortable for safe delivery). she couldn't talk having surgery(it was one way communication and she clarified our quires on writing paper :) ) and still everything she was writing up on paper and prescribed what should do for that night and early morning. i don\u2019t think any other doctor will available like this for patients especially when they have surgery for throat and situation where she can\u2019t even talk anything. We are very thank full for dr Manjula Ma'm great support on that day.\n\nAfter almost 28 hours of painful contractions, On the next day morning (27th May) the time came for delivery. They shifted to labor room and Ma'm was taking fluids in other room (Might be she couldn\u2019t swallow food due to surgery) and attended for Normal delivery at 9.32 AM :)  Me and My wife very much Thankful for Ma'm Great support and we would like to share about Manjula Ma'm to our baby when she grown enough to understand it :)\n\nWhoever looking for best gynecologists, blindly you can go ahead with Dr Manjula and follow her instructions. You will be in very safe hands and will experience smooth delivery process.\n\n-Thanks,\nRaja & Shahanaz\n\n",

                "review_text": "Wonder Woman\n\nWonder Woman 1984 movie was released in May 2021. It is a good movie. The movie, for those who have not seen it, is about a fictional DC character Diana Prince, An Amazonian with super natural powers and who saves the world. For us, real life Wonder Woman is, Dr. Manjula Deepak.\n\nWe are parents of 2 daughters (Vismaya and Vinyasa) both delivered by Dr. Manjula Deepak. 2 normal deliveries and we are 2 happy and grateful parents who want to share our experience so that others can just enjoy the parenthood and not worry about anything else in the world.\n\nDr. Manjula Deepak is real life Wonder woman. We don't have enough words to describe how grateful we are to Dr. Manjula. Both of our daughters were delivered by Dr. Manjula in Cloud 9 HRBR Layout. First one in March 2019 and second one during COVID times May 2021.\n\nWhen you are about to become parents for the first time, you have a lot of questions, some fears; what would happen if the water broke at midnight to is our baby doing well, is mother eating properly to why is baby not kicking from last 2-3 days, what to eat and what exercises to do during these days; what to expect during the delivery. You will get all the answers and more. She is extremely patient and listens to you and helps out even to internet/google research parents, which we were :). She is so friendly that you would be quite comfortable. She always has a smile which puts you at ease and you feel like she is a family member.\n\nOur first baby,\nShe accommodated consultation timings as we were travelling from Electronic City to HRBR layout; sometimes 2 hours of travel in Bangalore traffic but we didn't want any other doctor. She suggested exercise, medicine, diet changes which we followed religiously. She also answered our queries on WhatsApp. The delivery was induced as babies growth was sufficient and normal delivery would be tricky if we waited more. The water broke in mid-night. We called Dr. Manjula and she immediately picked the call at 2AM! She said don't worry, just come. We felt so comfortable, although the labour was 9 hours, she was there to reassure that it is going to be fine. She wanted us to have normal delivery and it was. We delivered a healthy baby weighing 2.8 kgs.\n\nOur second baby, it was during COVID-19 Wave 2,\nWe both tested positive for COVID-19 in 8th month of pregnancy, the consultations, scans were difficult as the COVID protocol won't let the husbands along in the scan room and our first daughter would cry thinking the doctors are doing something to mom. The second delivery was also planned. Although the labour was 12 hours, we delivered normally, a healthy baby weighing 3.2 kgs.\nAfter the delivery, when we come back to senses, she visits you and takes selfies with tired but happy parents!\n\nShe is super busy as everyone wants time from her, but she makes sure you get enough attention and care.\nShe probably would skip lunch for your appointments and for deliveries which can happen in middle of lunches.\nShe would skip sleeping at night but makes sure she is available when you need her for the delivery in middle of the night with a big smile. You and I can probably do this for a week or so, but to do this every day and every night is super human thing. she is a great doctor and a great human being.\n\n\nAbout the hospital where she consults, Cloud 9 HRBR:\n- The canteen food is excellent. Might not get your favourite smoothies but the fruit juices are healthy; you might not get chicken biriyani but the meals are filling, neatly prepared, hygienic and healthy. Canteen staff are very courteous.\n- Some of the nurses might be new and less experienced but they are quite helpful, senior nurses are definitely knowledgeable and kind.\n- The rooms are clean and well maintained, they have proper ACs, bathrooms and sufficient space for baby and parents.\n- The Bangalore traffic could be bad to reach the hospital due to one ways and road repairs but as deliveries were planned, we didn't have this issue. Parking is nice.\n\nOne would have more babies if the delivery is this smooth. If words only could express how much gratitude we feel for Dr. Manjula Deepak, we would have written a book. There aren't enough stars to rate her .... seriously she is Wonder woman. \n\nSapthami and Vijesh.",

                "review_text": "My storytime was long pending. I conceived way back in April 2016 and there was no HBR cloud nine then it was only Cloudnine clinic at Kammanhalli. when I missed my periods I rushed to cloud nine clinics was my test result was positive. I had no lead in terms of doctor I checked with the staff of cloud nine and they immediately suggested a Doctor who was available then that was the start point of my nightmare, during my first visit I asked her about do's and dont's and never got any answer I felt lost, I had morning sickness or 24/7 throwing up sickness for the first couple of months one of such days when I was throwing up rigorously I started coughing blood and when I tried reaching the doctor through Clinic she never spoke to me but gave instructions even without listening to me properly. When i went again for my visit i had lost considerable amount of weight which is not good during pregnancy and i was put on alternate days vitamins injection which was painful, somehow i go through this as well and reached my next check up by then there was no improvement in my weight instead it had gone from bad to worse, I was put another rounds of injections which was 2 times a day for a week, On third day when the doc in my area was not able to find the nerve to poke injection i went back to clinic which was on a weekday, nurse there felt bad looking at my condition and referred DR MANJULA DEEPAK my saviour my god i would say she was very polite when i met her and her first question to me was if i were comfortable to converse in Kannada and I was more than happy to articulate my feeling my questions my fears in my language i was asked immediately to stop those injections and she told me just eat regular home made food and you will be fine and apart from the regular Iron and calciums pills no other medicines are required and from then till my delivery i would always be excited to meet Doctor Manjula like a kid she would listen to me with all patience in the world. I would generally take the first appointment of the day and later go to work from there on one such instance during my appointment it was a working day and I had my appointment a little later than my regular day and she asked if I had off and I told her my team is on offsite she looked from my file and asked why didn't you go? I was like isn't it obvious she told me YOU ARE PREGNANT, NOT PATIENT. She had given her number in case of emergency, While my pregnancy journey with Doctor Manjula was great after my delivery at Cloudnine Malleswaram my son had miconium aspiration and he was in NICU for 10 days his lungs had collapsed and during this time though Dr Manjula had given discharge clearance her duty ended but she would visit me every other day from Cloudnine old airport road or after her consulting time in Cloudnine Kammanhalli even if there were no delivery for her in Malleswaram Unit on that particular day one of those days i felt extremely emotional seeing everyone coming for delivery and leaving within a day or 2 with their babies and here i was crying looking at my baby attached with tubes, I called her started crying over the phone she consoled me around 12:30 in the midnight she comes to my ward after finishing a delivery at airport road because i was feeling low i never felt so touched, she personally went to NICU checked all the reports of my baby and made me understand what is the progress in layman term and tells me tomorrow hopefully they should call you to breastfeed the baby and next day i get call around afternoon asking to come over for feeding my baby was tubes free.. she visited me every alternative days till i was in the hospital for almost 10+ days and helped me recover mentally ... I am getting emotional as i type this today if my son is happy and healthy the entire credit goes to my doctor Manjula Deepak and its just not this a year or 2 back i had UTI at middle of night and i was in not town i was at night somewhere pain was unbearable i didn't know if she would remember me i called her she picked my phone saying \" Hey Ramya how are you ?\" that was my first relief and immediately i told her this she suggested few medicines i went in search of a pharmacy and got the medicine n survived that night just before COVID I suddenly spotted blood in my panty soon after my periods days and i was tensed ( thanks to the google symptoms) i like always called her and she calmly told me stop over thinking and if you still not convinced come over to meet me i ran for my life and there she told me the reason for it and took me to scan room herself and was present the entire time holding my hand ... THIS IS HER... nicest most humble and down to earth person, I wish i can imbibe few of her qualities... THANKS, A TONNNN Doctor  ",

Reasons are simple and I would like to specifically call it out as below and rate it for those who are now in a similar situation like how we were when we really wanted the best doc for us.\n\n\u00b7        Friendliness: my rating is 5 out of 5\n\nOne of the friendliest doc we have come across. She has this knack of easing out the pressure and stress with you generally would associate with during pregnancy. She makes you feel comfortable and the consultations are generally fun.\n\n \n\n\u00b7        Professionalism, Treatment: my rating is 5 out of 5\n\nWe found her a thorough professional and always available for the patients. She always quickly understood or diagnosed issues things became so much easy for us and we were confident that come what may, she is going to find a solution. There are specific things that happened and we were quite worried and had even gone to a couple of docs who we thought would be able to help and this was after the delivery, but then we finally decided to go back to Dr Manjula and like a snap of your fingers she diagnosed the issue and gave a solution. She believes in prescribing very minimum medicines and we were very happy with that too. One point I would like to specially mention is that I found her ability to remember names of everyone she meets is amazing and she makes it a point to stop and talk to all her patients whenever and wherever she meets them in the premises and correctly addresses everyone by their name. She might be really stressed out after her night shifts and multiple procedures but it never really shows up on her face when she meets you.\n\n \n\n\u00b7        Accessibility: 5 out of 5\n\nDuring your pregnancy, you would really want someone to be reachable 24/7 and for the smallest and silliest of things. Dr Manjula is just a msg or phone call away and that is so comforting and definitely made things really smooth and easy for us\n\n \n\n\u00b7        Cost: 4 out of 5\n\nThe cost bit, I am rating 4 as I quite didn\u2019t agree with the increase in consulting fees by Cloudtail during Covid. I understand the costs were increased to accommodate the additional expenses the hospital needs to bear for the various kits that is supposedly needed by the doctors to meet the patients.\n\n \n\nOverall, we would give a 5 out of 5 to Dr Manjula Deepak and would definitely and certainly recommend her to anyone who is looking to have a good pregnancy and delivery experience. We were lucky enough to have found her",

Yes, her energetic, positive & consoling nature will not allow anyone to look for an alternative for pregnancy needs throughout their life. Our very first consultation with her for ~10-15 min left us talking about her commendable qualities for the rest of the day. I personally love her calling my Wife's name (Jeshmaa....) which will give you a friendly feel even before getting into her cabin for consultation. She was clear & precise in conveying my Wife's pregnancy status from time to time and was appreciating my wife for maintaining her health & weight pretty consistently although you can find her being strict at times when you end up showing some variance in the expected numbers. Our consultation with her throughout my Wife's pregnancy was very positive & promising. Despite having all the conditions in our favor for normal delivery until the 37th week, the doctor wasn't happy about her pelvis type which hinted the fact that we should be prepared to go for C-section if normal isn't possible due to the suspected issue.\n\nHowever, when we hit the big day (D-day), it was a great & out of the world experience to us. My wife started getting light pain around 12:45AM and eventually it increased and had to admit her in the hospital at 6:30AM. They induced labor around 7:30AM and asked us to wait until 11:30AM after which the doctor inspected the condition and noticed that the baby has passed motion so wanted to speed up the delivery process but my Wife was not fully dilated yet and she couldn't bear the pain anymore. That's when the doctor played her role very decisively by talking to me personally and stating that everything is on-track & going great than expected. The only demand from her side was to convince my wife to bear the pain for another 60-90 min in order to have normal delivery & she made her team to continuously monitor the baby's heartbeat & was waiting for the right time for normal delivery. Finally, she was fully dilated within 90 min and the doctor with her entire labor team did a great job by delivering the baby successfully through normal delivery process after which I couldn't resist myself from giving the doctor a big hug.\n\nOverall, Dr. Manjula Deepak is a god sent angel for us who did all that she can do to deliver our cute little angel through the normal delivery process. All the preparation, pain & efforts paid off and we reveled in the miracle of birth. Thanks a lot to the doctor and her entire crew who played their role meticulously to make our baby's birth an unforgettable experience. We will certainly recommend Dr. Manjula Deepak & the Cloudnine hospital for all sort of pregnancy & maternity needs.\n\nThanks & Regards,\nSunil, Jeshma & Unnamed Angel",

                "review_text": "We were so happy when we knew that my wife was Pregnant, we were excited and scared at the same time as it was her first pregnancy. \n\nAs a couple we had a huge list of recommendations from friends and relatives about various doctors we could consult. \n\nOur first and foremost requirement at the time was to find a warm and caring doctor that we were comfortable with. \n\nOne by one we visited 7 doctors (some with an Attitude, some with a prescription for various scans within 2min of meeting and also from a particular Lab and a Particular Technician, some wouldn\u2019t allow the Husband in the consulting room, some speak only Medical jargons makes it so difficult to follow, some scare you that its going to be a caesarean on the first visit) and finally we met Dr Manjula Deepak.\n\nAfter the first interaction with Dr Manjula my wife was so happy and so excited and was so confident in saying that she is going to be our doctor, though the Hospital was never on our list (it was on the higher end \u20b9 compared to other Hospitals), the whole day I just heard from my wife that the doctor was like this, like that, she told this, she said don\u2019t worry, she was not in a hurry, she answered all my queries etc\u2026\n\nWhen you meet Dr Manjula, she is full of Energy, Positivity, Compassionate, Warm, speaks to you in the most humble and simplified manner, like speaking to a child. What one expects from a doctor apart for their expertise is that feel, that when u meet a doctor that everything is going to be fine, she will be there when you need her, she will comfort you when you are in pain, she will move any obstacles in your way, and all you have to do is rest your faith in her hands.\n\nWe have never felt that a scan was prescribed unnecessarily, that a Blood test was prescribed unnecessarily, that a medicine was prescribed unnecessarily. She has always ensured that only the required Treatment was provided.\n\nShe was available on the phone whenever you have a query (big or small), though she is almost always the busiest doctor in the Hospital 24x7 (Consult her once and you will know what i mean).\n\nOn the Final day we were at the Hospital at 10pm in the LDR, by then Dr Manjula had instructed the fellow doctors about the next steps, she visited us at 11 in the night (prior to this we only met her in the morning) and comforted us and mentioned we had time and that she will be back the next morning at 7am. We were waiting in the room that night, Dr Manjula comes in the room at 4am she happened to be there as another patient of hers delivered, she was there to check and left after sometime, only to return at 6 am to again check on us, this time we were worried, as my wife wasn\u2019t responding to the Treatment, she politely told us to wait till 9 am. And then she returned and still my wife wasn\u2019t responding to the Treatment, they tried inducing pain but it was all but clear that we have to prepare ourselves for a caesarean, we had time only till 1pm for a Normal delivery. So we waited and suddenly at 12 the doctors hurried to the room, called Dr Manjula, it was time, all the doctors encouraged, cajoled, reminded that it was all in my wife\u2019s hands for a Normal delivery. Can still hear Dr Manjula shouting that \u201cI don\u2019t want to do a caesarean, you had come to me months ago asking for a Normal delivery, now you need to push, you are so close, please push\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a boy, he was delivered normally. It was an ordeal for us for almost 14 hours but all through, Dr Manjula was right there\u2026\n\nShe was there every step of the way till the most crucial time, supporting, helping, guiding and by the Grace of God we have Dr Manjula as our Doctor. As a Husband a brother a friend and a fellow human being I would always recommend that you get a doctor as good as Doctor Manjula Deepak\u2026\u2026\n",

With all the good stories shared we decided to consult her and I would say that was the best decision we made for our pregnancy journey.\n\nShe has a very charismatic personality with full of energy and positive attitude. In our first visit, being a first timer, we had a lot of questions. To our surprise we got answers to all of them without asking. This shows her rich experience in dealing with the subject where she understands the mindset of new going to be parents. And the same happened in our every visit. She gave all the information required for the time without we worrying to ask. And she was always available on whatsapp for any emergency query.\nAnother thing which was very impressive about her was that she doesn\u2019t prescribes any fancy procedure or medicine. She suggests all the natural ways and procedures, natural homely remedies , homely supplements etc. On the medicine front too, i was never loaded with a lot of tests and tablets. I had a very smooth and happy pregnancy. \nThere was a point where we were thoughts of going to our hometown for helping hands during COVID. But it was just and just for the doctor and our confidence on her that we stayed back. And we are very happy with our decision.\nWe wanted NVD and again it was for the doctor that we were able to achieve it. My labor was long where at a point we broke down and was thinking of going for C-section. But doctor Manjula showed high confidence and kept convincing us to wait for a little longer. Finally, i delivered a healthy baby normally. She supported me though post delivery period too where i was very nervous about recovery of my mind and body. \nHer AURA is magical. Meeting her always made me happy even in my lowest of mood a 5-minute chat with her made me relaxed and feel better.\nDuring COVID where cloudnine only allows one parent to enter the hospital/doctor's cabin , she made sure my husband was involved equally in the journey. She spoke to my husband over phone/virtually in our every visit and kept him updated with all the progress our baby was making. \nA great doctor, a beautiful soul and above all a great human being. I highly highly appreciate and recommend her. She is a full package of great subject expertise and amazing consulting skills, she was everything I wanted from my gynecologist. \nDoctor Manjula, may you always be super gorgeous, super fit and kicking . You will always stay in my heart. God bless you !!\n",

I'm still not sure of these reviews are true or are all false. When I met her as a person she was really nice to talk , she kept a smile on her face and answered all the queries. All my reports were normal . She advised me with few exercise for having normal delivery and I religiously abide by her instructions. I was very happy thinking my doctor understands me and she is also trying for normal delivery.  I was very close to my due date which was on 10th of Feb but unfortunately  I did not get my labour , I became very worried and went to doctor. I was asked to do a scan to check the water level and to see if everything was fine. Thankfully everything came as normal. I checked with the doctor if she can induce but she refused and asked me to relax and go home and wait for the normal labour. I waited and waited for the normal labour  but unfortunately It did not happen, but I made sure basis on the dates given by the doctor I visited her with no fail. Now I was 42 weeks pregnant. Every one was worried home because according to them it was very late but thankfully doctor Manjula Deepak gave me the confidence nothing to worry. Finally I got a little pain and decided to admit in the hospital (cloud nine) at night 6 pm on Sunday while she was feeding her babies. She asked me to leave and get admited on Monday as on Sunday there are only limited staff. As I was very worried because of my past due date I became reluctant to go back. She arrived on at 8pm and decided to break the water and immediately decided to take me for c section  **** ** **** ******* I was absolutely fine till than.

You will see the same respect in the eyes of the people who work with her too.\n\nI met Dr. Manjula Deepak at Cloudnine Hospital in HRBR when I was 4 weeks pregnant and was recommended by a friend ( PS: she is extremely popular amongst her past patients and rightly so.).\n\nMy first consultation with Dr. Manjula Deepak allowed me to experience her positive and energetic nature. She is so passionate and thorough that she remembers more about you than you do about your own case. She understands the anxiety levels of the mom-to-be and responds on messages for any queries. \n\nI remember, I had a dicey first trimester which made me really anxious, low and under-confident but every time I would meet doctor she gave me so much confidence and hope. Most importantly, I always wanted to have a normal delivery and when I was 3 cm dilated, doctor sat me and my husband down to explain the process of delivery and comforted us. She patiently waited and encouraged me for a normal delivery till the end (yes, through 12 hours of labor!), she ensured that I was absolutely comfortable during the labor and took precious time from her busy schedule to bring our baby into this world via normal delivery.\n\nI still remember what she told me when I was 10 weeks pregnant \u2013 \u201cI will give you a baby, don\u2019t worry\u201d and boy she did :) We were blessed with a baby boy this May, filling our life with abundance and happiness for which we are extremely grateful to her..\n\nOne thing I absolutely love about her is she is very honest and tells you like it is. During my pregnancy, she encouraged me to have a healthy weight gain (which most doctors don\u2019t really care about much) and whenever I would waiver from the track set for me by the nutritionist she would tell me that its not going to help me or my goal of normal delivery and kept me focused.  Thanks to her advice and encouragement I am already 2 kgs away from my pre-pregnancy weight, Yay!\n\nFinally, she is someone I look upto as her passion is infectious and something we could all imbibe. Every time I cross cloud nine or go to cloud nine for my baby\u2019s consultation, my eyes keep searching for her. She still remembers my name even after all this time and always offers her warm smile and banter whenever I greet her. She is an amazing human being and an extra ordinary doctor in this field where most are looking to mint money! \n\nI highly highly recommend Dr. Manjula Deepak if you are looking to bring a little one into your lives :)\n",

So, I did reach out to my close friend who were also expecting a baby for his suggestion for a good Gynec. He referred us to Dr Manjua Deepak and that\u2019s where our journey started, which turned out to be an amazing decision of choosing her. I am so thankful to my friend too for doing so. \n\nAm sure, this review will help many such couples who can just walk up to Dr Manjula without any second thought and they will have a similar experience.\n\n1.\tFirstly, she is so friendly that at your first visit you feel so comfortable. She listen to your problems and comforts us by assuring that the problem is handled at ease, which is an amazing quality as a Doctor\n\n2.\tFrom the first visit itself we had gained confidence that we felt we are in safe hands\n\n3.\tMy wife had to undergo a Cyst surgery when she was in her start of 3rd month of pregnancy and we both were so tensed but she had assured everything to be fine with the baby and rightly by the grace of god everything was fine\n\n4.\tWe were always given a heads-up on upcoming symptoms/ body changes which helped my wife to be mentally ready\n\n5.\tWhatever the Scan reports say, she has never created a panic mode in us, which is so great of her\n\n6.\tShe was available on WhatsApp for any kind of emergency (Suggest not to message a Doctor unless it is an emergency)\n\n7.\tMy wife preferred a normal delivery, but due to situation we ended up deciding for C-section a day before she delivered. But Dr Manjula just walked up to the Labour room that night and comforted and gave assurance for a normal delivery irrespective of the situation which made us to re-think on our decision and agreed for Normal delivery. She proved that she was right which made us so happy\n\n8.\tOur baby was early by 5 weeks, doctor had to deliver the baby at 34 weeks. It was not a surprise for us, as doctor had hinted this right from 5th month of pregnancy and was monitoring closely. We were in a much better position because of her positivity and assurance. \n\n9.\tIt was such a great feeling to see my baby next to my wife within an hour of delivery\n\n10.\tNever seen a doctor be so committed towards their patients \n\nWords fall short enough to appreciate the service you do. You have been a great human being first and doctor next. Thank you for all your service, you will be remembered always by both of us and our family. Wishing you greater heights and success in your carrier :-) \n\n\nMithun Somaiah & Divya",

                "review_text": "This comes a little late but here is my note of my journey with Dr. Manjula Deepak. I thank God for having given me the best doctor who like an angel so wonderfully saw me through the whole process of having a baby. Dr. Manjula was my second doctor whom I consulted for my cyst and enquire about having a baby as my husband and I were planning for a baby. My husband and I had planned to meet another doctor in the same hospital but by Gods grace we got directed to meet Dr. Manjula. Initially I was very nervous and skeptical about our first visit. Meeting her in person instantly made us feel so welcomed and the conversation was so friendly and yet professional. Talking to her about my condition and the concerns I had was so comfortable, I felt for the first time that someone truly heard me out and understood my condition. The counseling she offered encouraged us and made us feel so optimistic about having a baby very soon despite my cyst. I truly enjoyed my follow up visits, doctor was so friendly and taught me to take things positively and to enjoy the process and assured me time and again not to worry. Those visits truly boosted my spirit and lifted hopes up. By the end of my third follow up checkup I had totally forgotten about my cyst condition because I that hopeful and knew I was heading in the right direction to having a baby. Per her guidance and medication, I began to follow them strictly. Dr. Manjula assured that within 3 months I can get conceived and per her word I got conceived with my first baby. Post pregnancy, we had timely and meaningful visits and through the process doctor took time to explain each phase of my pregnancy and kept us informed about our babys growth. Her medications and guidance was more than sufficient for both me and the baby. What I really appreciate is the passion Dr. Manjula has in her job, not many doctors come forward like her to go the extra mile to assure wellness of both the mother and the baby. I felt so secure and safe through every phase. Even if I couldnt consult face to face, she was always reachable over WhatsApp or phone call to enquire any concerns or recommend medication. Eventually in my visits to Dr. Manjula, I became so accustomed, we would wait to meet her again. Despite her busy schedule she is so hospitable and knows how to accommodate her patients and always treated us with so much respect and care. She kept us informed of what was upcoming and how I should respond to them, by that I was never too anxious for anything in the process. Some of the nurses also mentioned about how Dr. Manjula was looking forward to meet me and kept a tab on how I was doing. Even at the point of delivery, she took so much care that she even was willing to deliver my baby separately. She helped me to be prepared mentally and physically for what was going to happen during delivery. She ensures that both of us as husband and wife are present and kept my husband informed of how he can aid and support me. She took the time to be there to induce the pain for me herself and promised me that 99% everything is going to be good and we neednt worry. Doctor told that I should deliver the baby between 4am to 7am, but by Gods grace my baby started to come earlier. I was so surprised and felt so safe that at a moments notice she came over and had my baby delivered safely at 2.43am. God helped me deliver a beautiful baby boy. Both my husband and I and our families are filled with so much of joy and have a deep respect for our doctor simply because of the way we were calm and confident as Dr. Manjula always encouraged and helped us be confidant in everything, every concern we might have she clarified it right away and never was tired with our questions . I really hope and pray that many more doctors like Dr. Manjula will rise and be a blessing to many individuals and their families. I would recommend no other doctor but Dr. Manjula, I am totally confident that she will do her best to instill hope in mothers like me and help them bring up a baby. What I looked for the most was to have a normal delivery and not go for cesarean, Dr. Manjula stands for normal delivery and only when it is unavoidable she goes for cesarean. Dr. Manjula right from the start prepared us mentally and always pushed us to go for normal despite the pain. We need doctors like this, as cesarean might ease the pain at the moment but women suffer with back pain lifelong. Dr. Manjula ensured we have a normal delivery and I am so happy today that God sent us such a wonderful doctor. I recommend Dr. Manjula at Cloudnine Hospital HRBR layout. Just one appointment with her and I assure you will not be disappointed. Truly words cannot contain the gratitude I have for Dr. Manjula but I will always remember her and her family in my prayers and always be grateful to her. Thank you Dr. Manjula for your amazing service, truly you are the best in your job! I will miss the regular visits, hopefully will see you soon for our second baby. Thank you so much Dr. Manjula. Best Wishes and Warm Regards from Lilly Sophia and Godwin.",

We consulted her as we are not sure if these problems create any problem if we decide to have a baby. She gave assurance that these will not create much problem. Also she recommended to visit Dr Shamna from Specialist hospital to get more clarity on this problem as it was not her expertise. Once Dr Shamna gave us a green signal to go ahead with Pregnancy. We again consult Dr Manjula for planning a baby. She explained everything  professionally.  And my wife conceived in next month . We are very happy that that finally we will be parent. But back of the head always the concern of having those stones lived. After 3 month of pregnancy we got another bad news that she got diabetes . She put her into strict diet. and ask us to monitor the sugar level. It gone till 6 month but her sugar was not coming to the level. Then she refer to endocrinologist Dr Binutha Reddy from Cloud nine hospital . She suggested to start taking insulin and explained the complication during delivery because of sugar. Then I started searching about the effects of diabetes during pregnancy . And I found that baby normally gain weights due to high insulin level and because of that normal delivery is not possible. I discussed with my father also. He suggested that in big hospital they always prefer C- section over normal delivery. So he suggested to come to our village and said at least will try normal delivery in our home town. I discussed these things with doctor and she gave me assurance that she will try her level best to do normal delivery. She only asked to maintain the sugar level. Then we thought to take insulin 4 times a day and also monitor the sugar level 4 times a day. In our last scan we got to know that the baby wight is normal and we were happy that the hard work paid off. Finally the day has come and we got admitted to hospital. All the nursing staff along with Dr Alka was really supportive on the day. As doctor promised she done a normal delivery and we are blessed with a baby girl. the most beautiful  gift of our life gave by Dr Manjula. Thank you doctor thank you very much for all your support.\n\nAbove all what really touched my heart about doctor was , In our discharge date while i was discussing with her she told us to  pray that everyone will have normal delivery. This explains her altitude towards her work.\n\n1) She is very professional\n2) She remember all her patients and there  details by heart,\n3) Always approachable in phone as well\n4) Very friendly and behave like a elder sister.\n5) She prefers household solution over medication for common problems during pregnancy which I really like.\n6) She always give confidence to the patients.\n\n\nI recommend everyone to visit the doctor if you are planning a baby and I am pretty sure you will not regret and happy through out the life.

Unlike our previous experience with other doctors... Dr. Manjula made us very comfortable in the first consultation itself. She patiently listened to us and answered all our queries... She gave us her phone number in the first visit itself and said text me if you have more questions... I have never met a doctor who is so friendly and approachable... We still remember she told us taking care of pcod is my problem so don't worry about it... She explained us everything one needs to know about pregnancy and within a month we were expecting... First 3 Months were little difficult for my wife with excessive nausea and hyper acidity but the doctor took very good care of my wife.. we even have to rush my wife to emergency once at midnight and she picked up the phone and asked to take my wife to hospital and before we reached there she had called up the on duty doctor and already breifed them about what treatment needs to be done.this shows how much she cares for her patients.. while the on duty doctor was insisting on getting admitted She told there is no need to get admitted... She would never suggest any test for the sake of doing it. What we really liked is that unlike other doctors she would only suggest test and scans if necessary.. and doesn't make her patients spend extra money...this is rare in Bangalore... After 3 Months my wife's pregnancy was cakewalk... We followed every instruction the doctor gave and my wife was active and worked till the last day... She advised us on diet plan as well as exercises and this helped my wife the most she was fit and walked to the labor room smiling at 6 cm dialation.. at 37 weeks we went for regular check up my wife said the baby movements have decreased she checked and said my wife is already in labour.. she asked us to go home and notice the contractions.. she kept messaging my wife to check on her and called her to clinic in evening to check her again where we learned that my wife is 6 cm dialation already but she did not have intolerable pains.. she asked us to reach hospital and said she would be there in 2 hours and we will have our baby by 9 pm.. we reached hospital at 6:30 pm and my baby girl was born by 8:50 on my wife had such a short labor all because of Dr Manjula. She insisted throughout the pregnancy on eating dates to ease labor and doing exercises and this helped my wife a lot.. while many elders told us not to eat dates my wife followed what Dr said and she had dates since 5 th month.. another thing I would like to highlight is that even while we were at hospital in labour room Dr Manjula was available on the phone I was in constant touch with her.. usually from what I have heard from friends is that the gynecologist will be in touch with on duty doctor and would only rely on the information they give and they don't pick up the call from family members while the patient is in labour room.. but she would pick up the phone and was constantly in touch.. she came before the time and made my wife feel comfortable... My wife could walk next day of the delivery.. no one could tell by seeing my wife that she had delivered last night she was so active the next day itself.. I can not thank Dr Manjula enough for all her efforts... *** ** ** *** *** **** ****** *** *** ****** Even after discharge my kid had jaundice and we had to admit her again for treatment.. Dr saw my mother in law in lobby and came to ask why are we in hospital.. she also kept asking about my baby's health, she went out of her way to ensure my baby is getting right treatment by checking with other doctors as my girl's jaundice was prolonged for more than 2 weeks. Now we wish she was a pediatrician too... ** **** ***** **** *** *** **** ****** ** *** ******** It's very rare to find a doctor who is not only good at her job but is also down to earth, approachable and friendly... Despite being so busy she would always come and talk to her patients if she sees them somewhere. Rest assured if you are her patient you don't have to worry about anything.. she will take care of everything... We really thank our stars that we met her and our journey of pregnancy was so memorable all coz of her.",

Way back in 2018-19, 5 Years back she had helped us to become proud parents of our sweet and beloved little princess. She has helped us become parents for the second time now that too with twins. Thanks to Dr. Manjula for her demonstration of due diligence and her guidance towards our successful and most memorable phase of attaining parenthood. We are now blessed with twin baby boys both in their best of health and weight. She is awesome as a doctor, especially in placing the right focus on each of her patients. Surprisingly, as not to be seen in most of the doctors, she diligently remembers each detail of the health conditions of her patients, their medications, their allergies and follow-up dates, etc. Apart from a great doctor, Dr. Manjula is a great soul as well who aims at serving the society with her best possible efforts and capacity. She is right there when there is a need may it be any part of the  midnight or day time. Really perplexed to see the way she manages between her consultations and delivery cases effectively without injustice to either. She visits the scan rooms personally many times to ensure proper understanding on the case. Also, I would not forget mentioning the way she explains and encourages her patients to make them aware of some of the treatments/procedures like cervical encirclage etc and helps take right decisions during the course of pregnancy - Only to ensure the best for her patients.  This, to a great extent helps towards the very high success rates that she delivers. Another great thing that we have noticed in Dr. Manjula \n is the result-oriented & efficient planning that she does. I am grateful to the Almighty God that he connected us with this awesome doctor. She is also available on messaging apps/platforms for quick doubts/clarifications, which is one of the greatest assets of consulting with her.\n\nOverall, I would definitely suggest/insist my friends/colleagues to Dr. Manjula Deepak without a second choice !\n\nAlong with Dr. Manju Deepak, I am thankful to cloudnine & the staff who stood with us in every step to ensure that we achieve parent-hood gracefully !!\n\nAll The Best and may God bless you,\nTRS & Uzma",

Maybe for this reason, in our journey towards parenthood; most of the doctors just looked either like a high-class business professional\u2019s or highly talented \u2018Medical Engineers\u2019. For me these Medical Engineers looks like a perfect doctor only when they add that additional component of Magical touch. Dr. Manjula Deepak is one such doctor that we met in our life, words can\u2019t just describe her way of treatment. Because it\u2019s not just about the treatment, it is something beyond her work. I could say - a great relationship that she builds-up, the trust that she develops in, her activeness that encourages patient and the smile which takes all the burden and worries out of the patient. Seeing such doctors, I still believe that the medical science remained as the priceless service on this planet. My wife had just completed 3 months of her pregnancy when we decided to change the doctor/hospital due to traveling time (which is more obvious in Bangalore) and family concerns. Finally, we have decided to consult in Couldnine because of its huge network spread across Bangalore. I found Dr. Manjula Deepak\u2019s profile on Practo and the feedback given about her treatment just amazed me. I asked my wife to let\u2019s try once before finalizing the doctor for the rest of pregnancy treatment and labor. My wife agreed and then we met Dr. Manjula. What to say about that first visit? Awesome, she impressed both of us in first ever visit. I should thank Practo for making this to happen. The way she calls the patient\u2019s name, the way she interacts with the patient and her family, the courage that she initiates in the patient everything just delights us. Soon after that first visit my wife said I will continue with Dr. Manjula and then the relationship between the doctor and the patient has begun. For my wife, Dr. Manjula is more like a family member, just like her elder sister. Dr. Manjula made the journey of pregnancy very simple and most memorable one. My wife was bit doubt on having normal delivery due to her medical condition but Dr. Manjula helped my wife in every stage of pregnancy and motivated her to make it possible. Finally, on the D-Day, fluid membrane was broken and my wife was admitted to the hospital in the midnight. Dr. Manjula Kept calling my wife and instructing what need to be done to ensure that it is actual water membrane broke-up. Meanwhile she called to the hospital and the duty doctor to make the necessary arrangements. Morning at about 8AM she visited induction room to ensure the pain is building up, afternoon, after her regular consultation came to induction room and shifted my wife to the labor room and again visited in the evening to get our cute princess out of her mother\u2019s womb. Wow.. What a touching moment it was..\u00a0\u00a0Thanks to Dr. Manjula Deepak for all the support throughout this unforgettable journey and making those golden moments more easier and memorable",

My association with Dr. Manjula began two years ago when my husband and I decided to embark on the beautiful journey of parenthood. Eager to find the perfect gynecologist, I started online research and review reading. Among the multitude of options, Dr. Manjula's glowing reviews caught my attention, showcasing her adeptness in handling diverse cases. I made the conscious decision to visit her at HRBR Cloud Nine, even though it meant traveling a bit further from my home.\n\nFrom the very first visit, it was abundantly clear that I had found the ideal doctor to guide me through this transformative phase of my life. Dr. Manjula embodies dedication, compassion, and unwavering confidence. Her dynamic and energetic nature radiates positivity, and her friendly attitude instantly puts patients at ease. Although I had never considered the possibility of a natural childbirth, Dr. Manjula empowered me to embrace this option. She became my unwavering pillar of support, accompanying me every step of the way, and ensuring a safe and healthy delivery.\n\nWords cannot express the depth of my gratitude towards Dr. Manjula for the extensive support and care she provided. She played an instrumental role in making our dream of parenthood a reality. Without hesitation, I wholeheartedly recommend her services to anyone in search of a gynecologist who combines expertise with genuine care.\nMy experience with Dr. Manjula Deepak has been nothing short of exceptional. She is a remarkable gynecologist who goes above and beyond to ensure her patients' satisfaction and well-being. Dr. Manjula's expertise, combined with her compassionate demeanor, sets her apart in the field. She helped me achieve a positive and fulfilling childbirth experience, and I will forever be grateful for her contributions to this precious chapter of my life. To anyone seeking an outstanding gynecologist, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Manjula Deepak as the epitome of excellence in her field.\n\nWith Lots of Love.\nRajlakshmi & Barda",

We went with our friend's reference, but we were having not even 10% of confidence of giving birth to a child, but she has (Manjula Mam). \nFirst thing she did was cutting off all overdosed medicines which my wife use to take (obviously suggested by other doctors) and bring down it to one tablet that is Folic. Guess what, very next month my wife conceived naturally without any external medical aid.\nWe went to Manjula madam, and she was very cautious at our initial stages till we complete 3 months. But let me tell you one thing, there were no extra medicines given to my wife except madam giving us confidence (She used to tell us nothing is going to happen until she is there for us).\nYes, Finally we completed 38 Weeks, that too without any overdosed medicines and steroids.\nGuess what, My wife gave birth to a beautiful little angel on March 3rd which we never expected in our dreams also.(That too normal delivery)\nThe best part about Manjula madam is she is confident and very patient to listen to you, at the same time she expects you to listen to her and follow what she says. \nSometimes she might be rude when you gain extra weight or when you increase your blood sugar level, but this is all about her concern about you.\nShe prefers doing normal delivery and never ever force you, or you force her for C-Section (My wife bore 12 Hours of labor pain, but Madam was very confident that she is going to make it as normal one, now we are realizing the Importance of normal delivery in our postnatal).\nFinally, I can say thanks to madam for making us parents which we never dreamed of.",

I was a bit nervous and scared with the new pregnancy feeling but after meeting her I was feeling better and then with each following consultations I found her positive vibes and she making sure about my right diet and being active throughout the pregnancy. I followed all her instructions for diet and exercise religiously and trust me it made my pregnancy quite easy and smooth. there were times I had my queries and she was always there to answer my questions and doubts. Also, there was once when I got her instant reply even at 3 O clock morning. When I reached end of my pregnancy where she assured that I would have normal delivery if everything goes well. she even considered my birth plan interest in no opting for epidural until needed. On my labour day I found her available there early morning soon after I was admitted.she respected my choice of no epidural and while I was giving up on my labour, she uplifted me and helped me going through well and I delivered my baby boy normal vaginally this January'2021I was told everywhere in Bangalore that doctor in Bangalore generally do C-section but I am lucky that I came across her and I was in safest and best hands for my pregnancy and I had normal delivery.She is someone with good vibes and positivity. May god bless her always \ud83d\ude4fThank you so much for being my doctor.I will always choose her for my next pregnancies anytime later as well if I'll be in Bangalore.",

She is super energetic and very friendly. She was very much concerned about our treatment, step by step she use to monitor us on our treatment for the whole 10 months. She doesn\u2019t refer any unwanted tests and checkups like other hospitals. Her determination towards our pregnancy period was very much caring and responsible to deliver a healthy baby. She is a very lucky handed person I can say, very soft and Kind hearted person she is.\nNow we are parents for twin babies which were a night mare for past 10 years from our marriage. We really wanted to thank Dr.Manjula Deepak from bottom of the heart for her dedicated treatment towards us. She is very easily accessible, few times we messaged even during mid-night for emergency cases, she replied within few minutes and I thank God for that because that was a very crucial moment at that pregnancy time. Sometimes I even called her for emergency situation in midnight and she always responds us with smile and positivity even that help us a lot for our success I can say. She guided us very carefully throughout our pregnancy time. I still remember we use to go with plenty of doubts few were childish I can say but she explains thoroughly with god smiling face and give us full moral support. She is a person with very much positivity and fortune. I recommend Dr.Manjula Deepak for the whole world and make use of her for your successful pregnancy.\n",

Heard from a friend about her and we decided to meet her. I should say it was the best decision we made! For the skeptical person I am, I was wondering why there were only good reviews and none bad. Now I know why I couldn't find any bad review. We always say doctors share the grace of god and indeed I saw it throughout my pregnancy, even in the delivery room. Anyone looking for a blissful pregnancy should definitely consult dr Manjula. A dedicated professional, you never feel that you are in a docs chamber. She is like a friend and listens to every minute detail and makes sure you leave her chamber in peace and with a clear mind. She never prescribed any unnecessary medications or scans. She always encouraged me for normal delivery. The calmness she has reciprocates all around and you instantly feel comfortable. I can say this because I felt it during delivery, I could see myself progress through the highest pain in a womans' life with ease and all this because doctor was by my side reassuring me of the remarkable progess I was making and motivating me to keep calm and stay relaxed through the whole process of normal delivery. We all dread the final day, but mark my words, for a first time mom like me it was a piece of cake all cos dr Manjula was my consultant. The ease with which she performed the nvd, it showed her prowess. Its all cos of manjula mam that I have my daughter safe in my arms now! I suggest all expecting moms to definitely consult Dr Manjula Deepak. Its not always the years of experience that count but the godliness in a person ** ** **** **** * **** **I shall conclude by saying - Dr Manjula Deepak is a highly gifted angel straight from the heavens",

She is humble, energetic, extremely down to earth, very caring and friendly person.\nA great Doctor like her doesn't need any feedback. Below are the experiences that we had during the 9 months of Pregnancy.\n\nThanks to the Practo for the great reviews , we decided to visit Cloudnine HRBR to consult Dr. Manjula (Assuming we can utilize our Health Insurance with Cloudnine)\n\nWe visited her for Pregancy consultation as my wife had Chronic Hypertension (High BP) prior pregnancy as well , Initially I was\nvery scared due to my wife health problems , child should not have any impact.\n\nFrom the very first day of consultation we were guided towards the right direction & later we felt very secured and confident\nthat we are in the right hand. My wife pregnancy was not a cake walk for her as she had a lots of complications in the second half of pregnancy\nbut we never lost hope because of Mam (Dr. Manjula Deepak). Whenever we used to see her face my wife used to feel relaxed (Looking at her whatsup DP as well :).\n\nWe used to believe \"now Mam is here and she will do what is best for us\". We used to wait eagerly for our visit so that we can meet her \nbecause we always used to get a positive energy after meeting her, my mind used to get relaxed when we stepped out of her chamber. \nWhenever she had any health issues through out her pregnancy mam was always available on whatsup and responded immediately to the queries. \n\nOne thing what we understood is that one has to trust her when being treated by her and then you are in the best hands. She is very friendly and understands the issue. (Remember our insurance provider was not covered under Cloudnine HRBR which we knew during the 1st month \nand still went ahead with consultation as we knew we are in a great hand.. God bless Manjula for getting our Smile and Mojo Back)\n\nWe got blessed with a baby Boy and he is of 2 weeks. \nThank you Mam for all your support. \nWe will always pray to Almighty for your well-being.  \n\nThank and Regards,\nKhushboo-Shailendra & our lovely Kid Atharv.\n\n",

It was one of the best decisions of our life.\nNot only did Dr. Manjula meet our expectation, but went above and beyond. We visited her from Day 1 and stuck to her till the day the baby was born and consulted her even for post pregnancy care.\nFrom Day 1 Dr. Manjula looked after us like we were her family, she acclimated to us very well and made us feel comfortable right from the get go.\nWe visited her multiple times throughout our pregnancy journey, and each time after the meet we walked away with greater confidence & repose.\n\nWe were hellbent on getting a normal delivery and had stated that to the doctor on the very first day as well, the doctor asked us to rest easy and not worry about the delivery now and just to pay attention on the mother and Fetus.\nUltimately the result was a Normal Delivery, led by the very capable hands of Dr. Manjula Deepak :)\nThe labor for my wife was a long and strenuous one, it lasted for around 16 Hours, there was a scare of going to C Section as well, apart from that there was a condition called \"Caput\" for my Baby (Where the baby's head gets elongated because the baby has been stuck in the vaginal cavity for long). Though all these complication & Obstacles, Dr. Manjula helped us deliver the baby through Normal Vaginal Delivery, a tremendous feat !!!\n\nIf i had to describe Dr. Manjula Deepak through a few adjectives, they would be - \n1. Uber Responsible\n2. Ferociously Passionate \n3. Fervently Energetic\n4. Work ethic of an Ox\n5. Acute Knowledge & expertise\n6. Affable, Approachable & always Available for her patients (24/7 by Whats App)\n7. An earnest personality\n\nWhen it is all said and done, we only have the fondest of memories and deepest of respect towards Dr. Manjula Deepak, she really is a Godsend ! \n\nIf we were to ever plan for another baby, I would love for Dr. Manjula Deepak to be our Doctor again.\n\nAnd for people looking to choose a Doctor to walk them through their Pregnancy Journey, Look no further - I would suggest Dr. Manjula Deepak 100%.\n\nPS -Thank you Dr. Manjula Deepak for showing your love, dedication & Hard work in helping us getting our beautiful son to this world :)\n\nThanks,\nAjay Ravinder & Ramya Gopal",

The generation in which we live is where most of them play around the emotions for the money,  but you are truly one of a kind. To be honest thank you will not satisfy me to appreciate, for what Mam has done and this seems very small word to express gratitude.  \n\nTo tell about the background of me & my wife, this is the first pregnancy for us after a very long time yes a very long time. We started searching for a doctor for regular general checks and instead of getting human, we got a goddess that is Dr. Manjula Deepak. \n\nI do not want to explain all stuff that she does, but she does what is the best for you and do not have a second thought of it, and do not look for a second opinion too as you are at best of hands and thoughts.\n\nMy wife delivered a baby girl on 9th of April '2021 with C section, before to that she was tested Covid +ve, even with that mam took it on herself to inform us by calling us so that we do not go bonkers when to see on the report. Mam took and necessary protocols and helped us during these tough times. Kudos to her :).\n\nMam, you will always be in our prayers and we want you to be the same as you are with the human touch emotions, the friendly nature, the humor which will really help who come to you. I will definitely remember that you use to express us stating that the baby will be like a bodybuilder like me and which she is, these small things help a lot which will be cherished.   \n\nYou are truly an amazing person with character nature and a personality, thank you, thank you & thank you...!!!\n\nHope after reading our story more and more people come to you so that they are guided in the right channel & direction to cherish their entire life from you.",

Even though having 20 years of experience, she failed to understand that we do have bunch of questions and more excited to know how the pregnency is progressing. But there was no much explanation. During lockdown, I had faced light bleeding and I was super scared and tried to contact doctor. But all in vain. And no response for any of the messages. Finally we decided to change the doctor at my 7th month. That's where we checked in for practo and found Doctor Manjula. Had to write down the older experience, coz you were completely opposite and never let us down. First meet with her, and it was like 'oh god! Why did i not check on her before'. Better late than never. every meet with her, we gained so much knowledge. Being first time pregnant, all my silliest questions was answered. Even if I hesitated to ask any question, she was here to understand and explain in detail of every procedure to be carried out. Simply she could have excluded our husbands in conversations telling its pandemic time. But again she stood above our expectations. Made sure even husband know what's happening and how's the baby growth. Even though I had c section, I was made well aware why C section is being opted. I never regretted for the decision.\nBest doctor I ever came across till date. So lively, enthusiastic, encouraging, friendly what not. She's a complete all in one package.\n*** ***** ********* **** *********** ******** ****** *********** \nGuys, Don't ever have a second thought to visit her, if you looking for a good gynac. *** ** *** ********Supriya & Kiran",

We visited Dr. Manjula Deepak for pregnancy consultation, we were recommended to visit Dr Manjula mam by one of the Doctor who is also associated to Cloud 9 and visiting new doctor, sharing our past tough times again made us little stressful but after meeting Dr. Manjula Deepak, what do I say? It felt like we met goddess as we asked lot of questions and she was so patiently listening and guiding us in right direction wherever necessary and not confuse you by putting you in situation where you start doing google search and go dig deep into. She answered all the questions generously. We always had a smile on our face when we came out of the cabin. What I liked most about her, when she calls (Ritikaaaaaaaaaaa \u2013with high pitch Ritikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa) that immediately gives us Red Bull energy, get-up-and-go situation to meet her and keep chatting with her whole day and mam will patiently listen to us. Mam responds to messages whenever she is available without disturbing other patients, takes care of emergency seriously and acts on it whenever & wherever required. It was her experience and full confidence on patients, she could assure us that my wife will have a safe normal delivery. It\u2019s said that Doctors are placed equivalent to God. I would say that it\u2019s because of Doctors like Manjula Deepak, we had a beautiful pregnancy journey. No words can describe thanks and our experience can\u2019t be put into words. Today, I seriously have no words to express my feeling but just whole-hearted Million Thanks to you from Ritikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa and Vishal. :) \n\nLastly, very important thing to mention, we had a nearby cloudnine center (500mts) but we still choose to go 15 kms far (HRBR center) only because of Dr. Manjula Deepak.\n\nYou will always be in safe hands when it comes to Dr. Manjula Deepak.\n\n",

However, were confused of which doctor to choose, somehow we gave it a go to meet Dr. Manjula Deepak, purely by looking at the reviews on Practo. \nBut the day we met her, myself and my husband both were super impressed with her friendliness and the way she explained  everything. No confusion from there, decided to stick to her till the delivery.\nThings which impressed us is, when we informed the doc about the travelling plan (when I was in my 6th week) which was planned well before conceiving, she did agree to it but proactively did the scan to check my sack. Also a scan was done by her upon my return too, to see if everything is fine.. And there are many such instances..\nAlmost at the end of my pregnancy, that's when I was in my 38th week, the scan did show that the baby's weight is little more than the average Indian babies. She immediately took the call to go for delivery in the same week, so as to try best for vaginal birth, since I had no complications and active throughout. \nThe day I got admitted to the hospital, it was 10PM and there she was just in 15mins to check me. She was available at 4 in the morning over the call. Again by 7AM in the hospital to check her admitted patients (to be mom's). \nAnd there again by 9AM for her regular OPD and deliveries. I was awestruck to see the same enthusiasm throughout. \nFinally, we gave up on normal and took a call to go with C-Sec, there was my boy with 3 rounds of cord around his neck. \nIf she hadn't adviced on the 38th week and if we were waiting for another 2 weeks for the delivery, have no idea how the situation would've turned out to be. My boy came out safe and all healthy. All thanks to the doctor. \nShe is truly an angel, in my mom's words \"Devathe\" :-) \n\nThis is from Vidhya and Harsha -Thank you very much doctor and sorry about the delayed review, typing it at 5 in the morning as my days are super busy with the kiddo\ud83d\ude42",

Dr. manjula was our last hope and she definitely made every visit worthy.. she took such good care of my wife during every visit and took time to listen to our problem every time. most of corporate doctors just take 10 mins per patient and try to clear the desk for the next available candidate but this doctor handled our case very sensitively.she made sure that patient was comfortable in talking to her and give all details without hesitation.her style of treating patients was so courteous in nature and we felt so blessed when finally my wife conceived.. it was a big win for us !!  The doctors advice really worked and my wife finally got pregnant.. complete tenure of pregnancy we followed up in same hospital and consulted Dr Manjula she gave us best care and advice for all day to day problems we face and we thank her for this noble service \ud83d\ude4fwe are really proud to say that she delivered our first baby which is just next to blessing and was a normal delivery. I strongly suggest Dr. manjula to everyone who are looking for magical outcomes in their lives.... lastly I would like to quote Mary's words which touched our lives.\u201cA baby is something you carry inside you for nine months, in your arms for three years, and in your heart until the day you die.\u201d \u2013 Mary Mason. ...",

Initially, till my 5 month of pregnancy, I was consulting another Doctor as I was staying in another place. And to be honest, I was in great confusion after we shifted to current location that if its ok to switch Doctor at 5 month, if the Doctor will provide proper care as I am reaching out to her so late in pregnancy.. etc.. etc.. There was so many questions and confusions in mind as it was my first pregnancy. But all these confusions just vanished after the first visit to Dr. Manjula and that turned out to be the amazing decision that we chose her. :) \\n\\nHope this review helps others who are in search of a Good gynecologist who is in confusion just like I was... So just Jotting down the best points why I would recommend Dr. Majula to others without writing a big essay\\n\\n1) She is super friendly and makes you really comfortable from the first visit, clears all your queries. Once you visit her, she remembers your name and details. Wherever she sees you, she 'll call out ur name with a big smile.\\n2) She doesnot give any unnecessary medicines and tests and foremost She encourages normal delivery unless you have any complications.\\n3) Have to tell this.. She is super patient.. Really thankfull to her for this.. I was a person with low pain threshold and also was very scared of normal delivery but so well she used to prepare me for normal delivery and in labour room also she beared all my tantrums and successfully helped me delivering my baby normally and today I am thankfull for that.\\n4)I had a severe food infection for which I was moved to another hospital but She was so kind and a person with beautiful heart that she visited me there in the other hospital in midst of this Corona chaos and her busy schedule, which I was least expecting. \\n\\nThanking God and Dr. Manjula for everything.. :*\\nIf anyone is reading my review to see if to visit her then I would just say \\\"Go Ahead! *** ** *** **** ********",

And yes that was the perfect decision I have ever taken. After the very first consultation with Dr. Manjula Deepak I was feeling so positive. It was my first pregnancy and I was little scared. She has a friendly and Frank attitude which is rare and that is what making her A Great Doctor .Every time I used to visit Cloud nine HRBR after my first consultation and She used to encourage me about the normal delivery. Even She gave me a Game plan of normal delivery and how to be prepared for it.Yes, normal delivery is painful but I swear I think it is the most pleasent pain of every women's life. Till the last day, Doctor was so responsible and careful that she was telling me during my labour pain \"Be Happy and strong , you are going to deliver A Life, a Baby ! \" . When the labour pain was becoming unbearable I was convincing doctor to go for C section. But she was so confident and positive that she was encouraging me in labour room also . And yes, whatever she told on first day, she did that. It was a Happy Normal Delivery. The ERA, when all doctor's favourite topic is 'C section', Dr. Manjula Deepak is comfortable and confident on her Normal Delivery skill. I don't want to 'thank' her, because it is definitely a very small word which i dont want to use. Positively Recommend to all 'to be MOM' * *** ******* ******* ** *** **** ****** ****** Respect YOU, your skill and experience !                 Kamala & Goutam",

I had previous history of missed abortion so i was very skeptical and scared.\nI still remember; after the first visit i was so impressed with her that i was 101% sure that she was the doctor for me. The reson for this surety: her amicable nature and the patience with which she listens to your problems and her treatment speaks measures about her expertise in her field.\nI have had a rough pregnancy period: from early gestational diabetes to chicken pox in second trimester to cervix incompetence in third trimester; but dr manjula was always there to calm me *** **** ** *** **** ********* ********. For cervix incompetence i had to undergo surgery to put shirodkar stiches. I called dr. Around 5 pm about the ultra sound report for cervix incompetence and she quickly asked me to get hospitalized at cloudnine hospital. She came rushing to the hospital at 9 pm and performed the procedure at 11 pm. \nMy husband was out of country at that time but i did not feel slightest fear or doubt about this operation because of my trust and confidence in dr manjula.\nI still remeber when i had chicken pox; i was really scared about its affects on baby. I had googled a lot about it to worry me enough to have sleepless nights. When i reached to dr manjula about my fears and worries she explained me the consequence and measures so well that it calmed me down. It was the trust that she has built up that i was relieved immediately.\nThere were so many complications in my pregnancy that any other dr would have optd for c section. But dr manjula assured me that she will try her level best for normal delivery and if it doesnt works she will go for c section. On D day dr induced labour around 11 pm and we were anticipating that i will go into labour around 7-8 am in morning.\n But everything happened fast and my water broke around 5 am. Dr manjula was immediately informed and in no time she rushed to hospital. As soon as i saw her i took a sigh of releif that my savoiur has come. I gave birth to a healthy baby boy.\nMe and my family are so thankful to dr manjula. My normal delivery was only possible because of her.\nI strongly recommend dr manjula as ahe will make your pregnancy journey easy and memorable one.\n\nWe are grateful to you dr.\nWish you all the success and good luck in life.\nRegards: \nBaby Hardik and his proud and happy parents manisha and sandeep",

Dr. Manjula Deepak is extremely talented and an expert in her field. She exactly knows what is best for her patients, provides the right advice and guidance and takes the right decision. She is so perfect in what she does!  What is unique in her, is her smile and personal connect with the patients which can make anyone with any complication, fear or doubt sail through the entire course of pregnancy smoothly.  Even if you don\u2019t have your family with you, just a person like Dr. Manjula Deepak is enough to make you feel at home. It was only due to Dr. Manjula Deepak I had a normal delivery. If anyone is skeptical about getting labour pain at midnight, with Dr. Manjula Deepak there is nothing to worry!  She was with me even before the birds woke up and before I even realized I gave birth to a baby girl!  \nWhen my baby was admitted in NICU due to some infection for few days, I was worried and though we had a pediatrician i called her to hear comforting words. Unmindful of time, she personally came to the hospital at night to see my baby and met me in the room to reassure that everything is fine.  Further the staff at cloudnine Kalyan Nagar are so friendly and good. One thing which you will definitely notice in Cloudnine Kalyan Nagar is the smile you are treated with right from the security guard to all the staffs and doctors. Highlights about Dr. Manjula Deepak :-\n\u2022\tOne of the best in Obstetrics & Gynecology \n\u2022\tVery cheerful, high energy levels,  positive and a trustworthy doctor. \n\u2022\tListens very intently and you can clarify all your queries. You can call her as well. If she is busy, she will call back. \n\u2022\tYou will realize that you have found a friend who is an expert doctor. \n\u2022\tGreat Decision maker. Takes right decisions at the right time. \n\u2022\tAdvises like a family member.\n\u2022\tMulti lingual and connects with her patients. \nI strongly recommend Doctor Manjula Deepak and anyone who goes to her will definitely feel the journey of pregnancy comfortable. \n",

And that's the best decision I took during this journey of motherhood. Especially after being a victim of poor support from my earlier obstetrician. I had GST my sugar readings were erratic. My first encounter with Dr. Manjula filled me with hope, confidence and peace. She approached my case with positivity ; very skillfully addressed the immediate GST problem by connecting me to an endocrinologist. ***** **** ************** gave a download on how the next months going to shape if I follow the specifics given by her. I have a paranoia to even syringes, never thought of normal delivery as an option but she mentally prepared me for normal delivery talking about it at ease from our first meeting. She gave ample time and answered our questions even if they are trivial (sometimes even to chat or joke lightly which I haven't noticed generally in doctors). She spoke to my husband and prepped him on what/how his actions will help and impact me during pregnancy and delivery. She was always available which was such a luxury to have from your doctor, I would reach out to her and she would respond to calls or texts the same day.\nMy delivery day Dr. Manjula was present to check on me regularly. I went into labour, Dr. Manjula gave me a pep talk, her positivity and warmth even helped my mother and husband at this time of distress as mine was induced labour (my mother, says Dr. Manjula is an angel). To my earlier belief Dr. Manjula delivered my baby boy (normal delivery) with her staff who were considerate, caring and great professionals. \nMy entire experience though difficult (as it was induced normal delivery :-)) as I reflect back seems surreal. This won't have been possible had it not been for Dr. Manjula Deepak. I felt safe in her hands, if you are looking for a doctor whose medical knowledge is encyclopedic, treats the whole person, and takes time to be caring and accomodating I would recommend Dr. Manjula Deepak. I'm grateful to her, seriously, for journeying with me, helping me cross this bridge blissfully. Dr. Manjula Deepak is holistic, empowering and a True Star. Dr. Manjula Deepak has my total loyalty as a patient and I sincerely express my heartfelt gratitude to her. \nTHANK YOU Dr. Manjula Deepak. ",

We are happy and also in total dilemma of which doctor to consult this time, as we have already consulted a couple of doctors in the previous pregnancies. Ours is a critical case as the cause of the previous miscarriages were not known. As per our understanding, new doctors may not have the expertise to deal with our case and the senior doctors have less time to have personal attention and connect with our concerns and queries to take care of the minute details.\n\nFortunately, we had this doctor recommended by a known reference. During our first visit itself, we knew that we are with the right doctor when she explained the process that she would follow through this pregnancy and her expertise and confidence in understanding our case helped us to trust in her which we didn't get it from any other doctor so far we consulted. A plan was charted and we just followed through the plan and put our confidence in her. Though it involved in precautionary medical procedures and protocols when are bit strenuous and necessary to have safe delivery, all those were wiped out with the positive vibes and friendly talk she does which eases out all doubts and lights up the confidence in us. She is reachable in need which helped us to clarify all the concerns we had even the minute ones and she took personal attention and care towards us and helped us to handle things efficiently and encouraged us through out the pregnancy.\n\nWe had a lot of hurdles to cross through out this pregnancy including precautionary cervical stitch, sugars going up and down, baby in breach position but with the timely decisions the doctor took and her right instincts helped us finally to have a healthy baby girl delivered safely on 19th May 2017.

But as a last advice he met Dr. Manjula and there where the story begins. I was also accompanying him while we had discussion on what would be the next course of action and the way Dr. Manjula walk us throughout the plan it was on another level. She made us aware of the current situation, complications and then she explained what action plan she was going to perform, it\u2019s advantages as well as the risk factors associated with the complications. All these were so thoroughly she put across us that it gives confidence on the level of her understanding of the situation. And within 3 months my colleague was blessed with a healthy baby boy. So that\u2019s where I decided whenever we plan for baby will definitely take experience and expert consultation from Dr. Manjula.\nNow on June 2022, we were blessed with a baby boy. We are very thankful to Dr. Manjula Deepak for the guidance and support she given provided throughout the pregnancy journey. She is very friendly and  professional ready to help us with any queries. And the best part is that she responds to our WhatsApp messages as in whenever we have any issue. During pregnancy whenever we had an anxious moment in the last 9 months, We came out content and relaxed after consulting her. Such is her experience and expertise. She always explain all the symptoms before hand each month which will make us relaxed and prepared. During our visit to her she will make us feel good she will always recommend for normal delivery and gives us a diet plan and routine. An Honest and dedicated doctor like her in these days is a blessing to the mankind. We are really indebted to Dr. Manjula Deepak and her staff at the Cloud Nine HRBR hospital for a safe and successful delivery of our baby boy \u201cKrishiv\u201d.",

From 1st day of visit and till today Dr. Manjula Deepak is very helpful and understanding. she answers all \nqueries and clear all the doubts. She is very friendly in nature and makes her patient feel comfortable. Two major complications went smoothly under her medication and guidance. First during 7th month i got chicken \npox, doctor immediately recommended me to visit Dr. Aruna Prasad (Dermatalogist).And Second during 8th month i got covid and i was given medication and got cured. She is always available for her patients and answer their calls and replies their messages. She does her treatment with minimum medicines and in natural way. She recommends walking and exercise to stay fit during pregnancy and for normal delivery. On my day of delivery early morning my water bag got broke and immediately we messaged doctor and she called us and told to come to hospital. I was operated in labour room by her team (excellent team) as per her instructions and when the exact time came for delivery Dr. Manjula arrived, She made me feel comfortable and started the process. We thank Dr. Manjula Deepak......on 4th march@4.22pm.....we were blessed with our little princess (named- IVANA). It was a beautiful experience and comfortable journey of 9 months with her.\n\nWe thank u once again as u gave the opportunity for the father of baby to be present during the delivery and baby was born infront of him.\n\nShe is excellent doctor and we recommend people to consult you.\n\nThank u so much Dr. Manjula Deepak <3\n\nAnjali & Apoorv",

She's really really the best doctor you can have on your side as you navigate through your pregnancy. There already 100s of appreciation posts below, but I'd want to highlight a few special things which blew our minds as to-be-parents1) Her focus on aiming for a normal delivery, not believing in unnecessary tests, medicine and array of noisy things you'd read or hear during the journey. She is the brand ambassador of a healthy old-school pregnancy.2) Her ever smiling, never-say-tired attitude which builds your full confidence in her. We've seen first hand how she'd skip lunch, rush to the hospital at 2 AM for your emergency and care for literally each and every mother/family as if they're her own. I've had my share of tryst with doctors and I have never seen someone so dedicated and courteous3) Her patience in listening to your endless queries, coming from in-laws or Google searches - she'll take them in her stride and guide you to the best thing4) She's also the sweetest woman, who'll become like family during this journey & we fell in love with her. There have been times when me and my wife have just wanted to meet her for pep talk :) She's THAT good.I'd recommend her & her hospital staff Cloud9 HRBR blindly to everyone in my circle. She made our wonderful parenthood journey even more special & we will forever remain indebted to her for this special period of our life.",

One of our cousins referred us to go to Dr. Manjula, as we were planning our delivery in Bangalore. We first visited her when I was 4.5 months pregnant & her first impression was best!!! We were so satisfied with the choice we had made. We have never seen a doctor with such a high energy level & her voice itself is magic. After my first consultation with her, I went back to my native & diligently followed her tips. \nWe were looking for a doctor who motivate us for NVD & luckily the feedback we heard about her was meeting our expectations. She patiently listened to me & started tuning my body for normal delivery from the beginning. I had countable consultations with her but the image she had imprinted is immense & irreplaceable. Indeed, she is one of the credible, knowledgeable & talented doctors we have encountered so far & her crowded OPD is the proof of this fact. \nI delivered a healthy baby 15 days ago & big thanks to Dr. Manjula for encouraging me in my labor at midnight 1:30. We salute her commitment towards the profession & the energy she carries irrespective of what time of the day it is. \nThere are not enough words to describe how thankful we are for your wonderful care during my pregnancy, labor & delivery. You have helped to bring the perfect miracle into our lives. We took a couple of days to pen down our emotions into words & we believe we had made justification in our attempt. We would highly recommend Dr. Manjula Deepak for any sort of gynecological issues, rest assured you will be in safe hands!!! \nLastly Thank you for taking such good care of me & my mommy - baby Stuthi Bhat.\n",

I\u2019m glad she kept her promise.\nShe was with me throughout this pregnancy, always available for me, be it late night or weekends, whenever I needed her she was there for me.\nEven when I used to message her at odd hours, she was quick to call me back ( which I was not expecting from a renowned doctor like her). \nShe is an amazing human being apart from being an excellent doctor. Her friendliness and relaxed attitude are a great help for ppl like me.\nShe never recommends unnecessary medication or tests and always forces to stick to homemade stuffs.\nAnd I love the way she calls my name, which she still does whenever we bump into each other in cloudnine HRBR branch. \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\nWhoever is thinking about consulting her, plz go to her without any doubt, you will be in the safest hands.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nThank you ma\u2019am for being there for me. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n*** *** *** *****",

She was so jovial n friendly n explained how to take best care of myself with more home remedies n minimal antibiotics. My completely pregnancy was a roller coater ride n was much emotional. Doctor was always supportive and counselled me so well n made me stronger. \n\nUsually during our visits me n my husband used to hv a bunch of questions on diet or excercises or few symptoms related ones, once we entered room doctor used to tell us all of those even before we asked for. She will give complete insight on what next \u2026.. not most if the doctors do. She suggests excercises n diet, following that helped me for having a normal delivery\u2026. I cant really stop telling more\u2026. She is bundle of positivity n always love to talk to her\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude0d\n\nN coming to my labour, i got my labour pain on Sunday noon n admitted to hospital at night around 11pm and was ready to deliver by 12. Doctor is dedicated to her profession so much she spoke to me on call and she came to hospital by 12 and boosted confidence soo much during the labour pain as i did not even rake epidural as i was admitted late and encouraged much and i had NVD. I delivered a baby girl and both of us are healthy and safe. We were in safe hands never disappointed in complete 39 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nManjula ma\u2019am was once of the greatest blessings during my pregnancy both emotionaly and morally and  and she is so good and highly recommended. Other thing we are waiting for is to get a picture clicked with her. Eagerly waiting to meet her soon n get a frame\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d",

I thought that whenever I visit her she will go through my papers to review my case but she remembered each and every thing about my case. I used to get nervous and panicked sometimes but visiting her used to calm me down. She understood my nature and the way she used to explain things really helped me to calm my nerves. She will speak to you like a friend or an elder sister. I am going to miss her pat on my cheeks. During my earlier pregnancy days, I consulted some other Gynaecologist . Soon I realised my mistake and in my second month, I consulted Dr Manjula and from that day we were sure that we are going to complete our journey with her. There was no looking back from day. She is energetic with lot of positive vibes. After 18 hours of labour, I was on verge of giving up and asked for cesarean. It was her determination and strong will that I delivered normally. The key is to trust her and follow her advice properly. She will not prescribe unnecessary medication and neither she will call for unnecessary hospital visits or scans ( only whenever it is required). For people like me who was always scared or sceptical about pregnancy and delivering baby she is the perfect Doctor as my journey was completely smooth under her guidance. May she continue to touch many countless lives with same dedication and passion. I will forever remain indebted to her for bringing most precious thing in my life. God bless her and her family.",

And that was a start to a great journey that lasted till the delivery. \n\nIn today\u2019s corporate culture and mainstream healthcare cut throat biz world, It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that is empathetic, knowledgeable, experienced, a great subject matter expert, and most importantly available. Dr Manjula showed a resounding overlap of all such qualities. \n\nFrom the first moment you meet her, you get engulfed in her positivity and highly addictive energy. She was sharp to assess problems, and then break them down into pointers that helped her patients understand the issue better. What followed were simplistic yet effective resolutions that helped my wife throughout her pregnancy. What was remarkable was her process to calm her patients nerves - not just with faff but logic, science and expertise. 9/10 times we walked out of her consultation with a big smile on our face -  that one time was probably because of long wait hours at the hospital (kidding). Availability- we always heard back from her. Always! We reached out to her for small, mundane asks and queries multiple times and she responded back without fail. Just amazing!\n\nHer credentials and experience pretty much speak for herself - the additional value that you get is an empathetic Dr who makes you feel stress free through your special journey. \n\nIf you\u2019re planning for child birth - ** ******* ** *** ** *** **** ******** **** *** **** *** ******* *** ********",

We came to know about Dr. Manjula Deepak through one of my colleagues and also through few patients at Cloudnine HRBR. \n\nBig Thanks to Dr. Manjula Deepak who is selfless and works like a super woman. I got tired by looking at her commitment and dedication. Personally I got inspired by looking at her work nature and involvement. She is an inspiration and we see less such awesome people around us.\n\nI can go on and write endlessly about Dr. Manjula Deepak. Just one word about her \"Eyes closed just go to her, you will be happier that you have chosen the right person for welcoming your new bundle of joy to your family\".\n\nWe had few problems in our pregnancy related to placenta. Dr explained about this clearly and comforted us. \n\nThough we have tried for normal delivery, due to dilation issues couldn't go for normal. Dr tried for normal as much as possible, but after 10 hours of efforts since my Wife's dilation was not enough, we decided to go for C section. She is did a great job in the surgery. My wife could be on her own within few days since surgery.\n\nDr Manjula is a go to person, feels like a friend, energetic person, runs around labor room to OT to consultations non stop even in this corona pandemic situation caring less of her. People like Manjula is a reason for any new parents such as us to have the pleasant pregnancy process through out 9 months as we know that there is our doctor who is looking out for us for any concerns or doubts.\n\nFinal word-- choose Dr. Manjula Deepak eyes closed.'\n\nThanks,\nKomala & Thyagaraju\n",

This was my first pregnancy after a long wait, also want to mention here that I come in elderly primi. So, I and my husband were concerned about which doctor to go to.. We were getting loads of advices from our dear ones and we too were praying to God to lead us to the best doc in the town and that is how we met Dr. Manjula from Cloud9. Our first meeting with her was so beautiful as both of us felt that peace in our hearts and we knew that she is the one who would bring our baby out into the world.. I had met her in the 12th week of my pregnancy and I am thankful to the Lord Jesus for making us meet with her. My every visit was so soothing and positive. As it was my first pregnancy, we had loads of questions and concerns which Dr. Manjula patiently listened to and answered.. She was even quick to reply to all my WhatsApp msgs.. She would talk like a mother, a sister and would always encourage and assure me that my pregnancy was perfect and that always made me  thrilled. My pregnancy journey would not have been this joyful without her guidance and support. I'm usually scared when it comes to hospitals, but I got so comfortable with my beloved doctor from day one. The way she deals with her patients is simply amazing. One very important thing I would want to mention here is Dr. Manjula prefer normal delivery. She wouldn't simply take the mother for cesarean until and unless it's really needed. If God blesses me with another child then Dr. Manjula would be my 'go to person' for sure.. May God bless you and your family dear doctor, and continue to make you a great blessing to many more mothers, as you were to me \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude4f",

Started with pre-pregnancy consultation and the doctor saw me through all the way till I delivered my twins last month.\n\nDr Manjula is one of the most friendly and reassuring doctors that I have consulted with. Her cheery attitude and confidence are very comforting. With a twin pregnancy, I started off being very scared - both about how my body would handle it and for the wellbeing of the babies. The doctor was extremely reassuring at all times. She never prescribed excessive medicines. In fact, she discouraged me from getting unnecessary scans / tests and stuck to fairly simple ground rules for the entire pregnancy. Unlike in a number of other twin pregnancy stories I have heard, she permitted me to travel in my second trimester and encouraged me to remain active through most of my pregnancy. She always set realistic expectations. What could otherwise have been a challenging time was made much easier because of her approach. \n\nThe doctor spent a considerable amount of time during each consultation explaining matters well and going over scans with us carefully. She usually preempted most questions we had and was always available on phone for any follow up doubts / problems I had. On two occasions, she rushed to the hospital because I was facing discomfort - on the second occasion, she delivered my beautiful twins :) \n\nEven with the decision of whether to go for a natural delivery of a c-section, and during the actual surgery, the doctor was very informative and caring. This went a long way in making me feel comfortable and in control. One instance is that right before I was taken for the surgery, she remembered that I was very scared of injections and asked the anesthetist to personally insert the tube for the IV so that I would be caused minimal pain and discomfort.  It made me feel like I was in very good hands - which I certainly was!\n\nI am extremely grateful to the doctor for her support. Most of all, since I have a tendency to stress a lot, it really helped that she balanced it off with her reassuring and kind approach. I recommend the doctor highly. ",

She is highly energetic, friendly, humble and professional at the same time . There would be no exaggeration in saying that she is a blessing in the field of gynaecology. Her dedication and commitment towards her patients is out of the world . The love and care that she has showed on my wife through out the journey is something that we are forever grateful for . She has the capacity to calm her patient in any situation and in any complications . She has been by our side the entire journey of our pregnancy and has made sure that we are comfortable and happy . She is someone who is available at any time of the day through whatsapp, calls and also we have seen her rush to hospital at very late hours for her patients .\nMy wife had to go emergency deliver weeks before her due date ( preterm) and Dr.Manjula walked in through those doors at 3:30AM in the morning on a Sunday after going home after finishing another deliver , just to make sure my wife and kid are safe and sound . \nWith all the complications of preterm , cod around neck and bleeding she has calmed us down and ensured that we are ready and has delivered our little bundle of joy in time healthy and brought smiles to our faces .\nWe have experienced something that might be rare , we have seen her rush to hospital back to back at very late hours to make sure all her patients are healthy and happy ..\nSaying Thank you is a very small thing for her for what she has done for . We wholeheartedly wish her all the happiness in the world and would 100%recommend Dr.Manjula Deepak to all the people who are trying to have a baby visit her as she made our pregnancy journey a wonderful experience with her presence .",

In January 2020, my wife was pregnant and we were overwhelmed with the news, we were all happy until she was 12 weeks after a few blood tests (double marker) the doctors from other hospitals informed us that the test shows high risk (Its high level is indicative to a higher risk of Trisomy 18 and Down's syndrome) unfortunately all this was happening during the pandemic and the lockdown. I and my wife visited more than 3 to 4 hospitals and every time it was disappointing. few doctors also advised us to abort and to not take any chances that is when we were introduced to DR Manjula Deepak through my wife's friend. The first day we met her we realized we were in right place and the safe hands. Oh my god, what a personality i have never seen a doctor like her in my life and I am not exaggerating the passion she has towards her profession, the way she communicates with her patients, the confidence she gives to the family members of the patients. she is available round the clock and you can ask her any doubts any time she answers it without losing her cool. She took us through the entire pregnancy with such ease. then came the labor time my wife was admitted to the hospital at 10 pm she was home at that time I was surprised to see her in the hospital at 11 pm and she was just around and finally after almost 10 hours I was all tired but again to my surprise she made sure by 9.33 am my wife had a normal delivery and we welcomed a baby girl. I can go on and on about this wonderful human being but I have kept things short. I am recommending Dr. Munjala Deepak to others with 100% confidence and am sure she is going to be a blessing in your lives that we can guarantee from our own experience. here I am thanking her once again for changing our lives.Thanking you and will always be grateful   Sandeep Ramachandran    Gayathri Priyanka",

Her observation on patients history was super impressive. She is highly energetic , humble, friendly & equally professional. She always made me feel comfortable. She is highly positive person which always kept me away from worries. In my 35th week of consultation we got to know that baby has not taken the position as it has more than the expected weight. Myself & my husband thot it\u2019s gonna be a caesarean for sure .. Manjula DeEpAk did not give up she gave us time for the next 2 weeks & even at the time of delivery wen I personally gave up on normal delivery bcoz of pain I had to go thru. But Dr Manjula just walked up to the Labour room that night and comforted and gave assurance for a normal delivery irrespective of the situation which made us to re-think on our decision and agreed for Normal delivery. She proved that she was right which made us so happy. My sincere gratitude to MaNjUlA Deepak from bottom of my heart for her sincere support & proper guidance throughout my pregnancy journey. It was an amazing decision I made consulting & trusting MaNjUlA Deepak with no other 2nd thought anytime in this journey. I highly recommend MaNjUlA Deepak to my friends & family members for pregnancy. Thank you doctor for all the support & positivity you gave me throughout my journey for 9 months especially at the time of delivery . Thanks for giving me & my baby a second life \u2764\ufe0f My hearty wishes for your success in your carrier and tons of happiness.

My wife and I started visiting Dr.Manjula since the beginning of our pregnancy. She is a representative of kindness, friendliness, compassion, love and care and goes all her way out to put her patients at ease. \nShe is someone who is available at anytime, on call, whatsapp and personally to counsel her patients. In our case, my wife had a bleeding in the early weeks of her pregnancy, and Dr.Manjula ensured we were tension free and safeguarded the health of both my wife and our baby. At every point, she would give us information before hand about what to expect, which made us well prepared for the situation. In our case, my wife had a water break at home, and we were totally panicking. Just a call to Dr.Manjula, and she ensured things happened smoothly. She had already instructed the labour section about our coming, and once we were there, she ensured she arrived in no time(though her presence at that moment was actually not needed), just to comfort us. Also, from the day 1, she prepared my wife for a normal delivery by guiding her with basic exercises and diet, and the result was a normal vaginal delivery. It was late night when my wife was suffering with labour pain, and I was in total pain too seeing her suffer. I requested Dr.Manjula to go for C-section, so that it would ease my wife's pain. However, even in such a situation, she calmed me down, counseled me and brought out our beautiful angel into this world. \n\nThank you is a very small word to describe what Dr.Manjula has done for us. We are ever thankful to you and God bless you and your family. Anyone who wants to experience a tension free pregnancy journey just needs to visit Dr.Manjula.",

My personal experience about doctors made me very apprehensive about the entire fraternity, but she proved otherwise. She knows what each of her patients wants and approaches each of them with a personal touch.\n\nMy wife was pregnant with PCOD and she ensured to instill confidence in us and pushed us for a normal delivery. In the first few weeks of pregnancy, my wife started bleeding but she was very calm and ensured that the child was safe and healthy. We had to go through a lot of emotional tension due to the covid situation, but she was always there at any time, be it on call, WhatsApp or personally to counsel and guide us. She answers even the silliest of questions with so much patience, and understands the patient from a motherly perspective. \nOur labour was unexpected since my wife's water broke at home. She immediately responded by coming to the hospital on that day, though it was a holiday, and the procedure could've been initiated by the duty doctor. At my request, she came in and instilled confidence in us. I was unable to see my wife undergo so much pain and called her requesting for a C-section. She calmed me down in this situation and ran in to the delivery room at the odd hour and made the normal vaginal delivery possible. \nAlso, a special mention needs to be made about her post pregnancy care. She will be there for you even after delivery and guide you like an elder sister. ln my opinion, Dr.Manjula is an asset not just for Cloud nine hospital but to the entire medical fraternity. God bless her and her family always. She's truly a gem and words fall short to express our gratitude to her. We are lucky to know her and be associated with her. \n\nRaghu, Mala and our little one.",

And she certainly lived up to that, giving natural solutions where possible and avoiding medication unnecessarily while helping me stay active during pregnancy!\n\nIt was controversial in my family when we chose to go to her instead of the usual doctor family members go to in Manipal, but I'm so glad we did, as our experience was way better than some of the stories we'd heard of about other doctors. Later, I heard that people come from far to visit her and now I understand why and having gone through my entire pregnancy, delivery and recovery with her, with such good experience, I probably will travel any distance for her to be my OB as well :)\n\nDr Manjula is a ball of energy! In the initial consultations, I found her too fast, though she never rushed us. Even if we forgot to ask her anything, she was always prompt, although not very verbose in answering on whatsapp, giving clear answer to what needs to be done. It's not just her high energy and positivity which made an impression, it was great to hear that she was in CMC Vellore and also to hear positive reviews from other doctors about her! \n\nMy labour was really long and hard and during delivery, we saw that she was certainly very skilled and knowledgeable in various induction and delivery options, aims for least intervention possible, gives you the time needed, explains options and allows you to decide, doesn't rush there either and is adept at performing different procedures too! \n\nAs I write this, it has been one and a half months since we delivered our baby and it was a very smooth journey from the frist trimester to delivery, to recovery now and only because of Dr Manjula's expert guidance and execution! Thanks doc!\n\nI always felt OBs get great reviews online, can they be trusted? though after my almost year long interaction, I'd say this one certainly deserves all her glowing reviews and more! :)",

After doing all the research on the net and after having heard many positive reviews directly from many people at Cloudnine, I had already made a prior decision, even before I conceived that undoubtedly my Doctor would be Dr. Manjula Deepak!       Words cannot just describe how grateful my husband and I are to her. Right from the day we met her, we knew that God has led us to her and we are in safe hands. Her warmth, caring, cheerfulness, positive energy and dedication makes one feel so very comfortable and tension free. On Aug 5th, she helped us deliver a beautiful, healthy baby boy through elective C - section. The entire procedure went on pretty smoothly and we couldn't have been more thrilled for our 'Little Prince' to be delivered by the magical hands of Dr.Manjula Deepak!       She is just fantabulous and incredible at what she does!Her abilities as a doctor are truly incomparable and unmatched! Thank you for doing such a marvellous job Doctor!       Dear doctor, you deserve A Very Big Thank You and Hug for all the exceptional care. We can never thank you enough for guiding us throughout my pregnancy journey until the delivery of our 'Little Man'. Sending all our warmest wishes to you. Thank you for the wonderful experience.         We would not change a thing about the entire pregnancy and Birth experience!                         Thanks A Ton Doctor!Lots of Love,Suma Srinivasa &Our darling 'Little Prince'",

She came highly recommended by people living around in North Bangalore . \nDuring my first trimester - i was nauseous all the time , puking multiple times in a day and dead tired . To add to that I had a bad bout of fever but Dr Manjula was always quick to respond on whatsapp with remedies . The only thing I looked forward to in my first trimester was waiting outside her consultation room to be called in  . If you ask any of her past or current patients they will tell you how she has a distinct warm way of calling out your name. She is such a positive force that for the duration of the consultation you would forget any pain and discomfort. \nI have always been super active , so my biggest concern was that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do so during my pregnancy . All my worries disappeared when I met her - she ensured that I had a normal and healthy pregnancy (dispelling a lot of myths regarding food and exercises ) . I was able to continue running after my first trimester right up until the day I delivered . I wholeheartedly thank Dr Manjula for instilling that confidence in me to continue . \n\nLastly my family was always quite keen on ensuring that I have a normal vaginal delivery . Dr Manjula recommended exercises throughout my pregnancy and kept monitoring the scans in the last few weeks to ensure that we push for a vaginal delivery as much as possible . So you can imagine how elated we were when I delivered a baby boy vaginally after a labour of just 5 hours . \n\nThere are so many such wonderful instances that my family and I have shared with Dr Manjula Deepak - from the bottom of our hearts we thank you for all your support and guidance and want to tell you that we love you \ud83d\ude0a(This space is too small to express our gratitude \ud83d\ude4f)",

Mam used to answer even our simplest and silly questions with a smile .\nMam was available even in the odd hours like morning  4 am and night 11 pm and so on . I contacted mam when I had an emergency during my labour .\nI had severe back ache and my water broke in 36 weeks. I was in emergency and called mam in odd hours . Mam was always available for our questions and support.\nMy labour was also very pleasant experience because of Dr Manjula mam. She kept me very comfortable during my delivery.  I delivered a baby boy Via C-section on June 13th, 2020. Her soothing voice gave me confidence during my delivery .  I have completely recovered and got discharged in 3 days from hospital and now I am spending happy time with my bundle of joy at my home .\n\nThis is my second delivery and I should say this time I had a pleasant pregnancy support and delivery compared to my previous delivery which was also C-section which happened 7 years ago in Chennai in different hospital.\n\nI strongly recommend Dr Manjula Deepak mam. \nDr Manjula Deepak mam is such a hard working, determined doctor I have ever seen who loves to serve people. Mam is always cheerful and greets us with smile .\n\nThank you again Dr Manjula Deepak mam for bringing happiness and joy in our family .",

Here comes Manjula mam, who is a paragon of empathy and positive energy. There is a saying that God sometimes lives in the form humans and she is one perfect example for it. I am surely not praising her high, its all the good attributes which requires a strong applause and you will notice all this if you ever got to visit her.\n\nLet me just narrate how she bestowed happiness in to our family. I took my sister to Manjula mam after looking at all positive reviews on Practo( I did not miss even a single review) and did not mind travelling for one hour to meet such efficient doctor. My sister was in complete depression due to her previous pregnancy, where she lost her twins due to preterm delivery in 24 weeks due to complete negligence by previous doctors( Its not easy even for the family members as it took away my complete family happiness). During the first meet itself doctor was able to completely understand the mental status that my sister would be in and gave complete confidence to my sister just like a family member would do. Even the silliest questions where answered without any denial and this made my sister believe that she will be there at any time to help. From the time she conceived and till delivery her emotions were running high and it was Manjula mam who was able to calmly answer all her questions and give her the much required confidence. I don't think anyone else could even do this with much patience. Now my sister got blessed with a Baby boy and it was completely because this time it was God send angel Manjula mam who took care of my sister. I still remember her words \" This is my responsibility to give your baby healthy in your hand and will not let a single seed unturned\" and she did it.\n\n\nThank you Doctor and I wish the very best for you and your family in all aspects of life. I will be definitely recommending Manjula man to all my friends.\n\nShankar( Malini's Brother)",

After reading the reviews online, my wife and I decided to find a good doctor for her pregnancy and delivery. we happened to come across  Dr. Manjula Deepak on Practo and amused by hundreds of positive feedback from the previous patients, we decided to consult her starting second trimester. From there on there is no turning back. we were extremely satisfied with the overall experience.  we definitely recommend you to consult her.1. She is very friendly and easy to approach.  considering that this is our first baby, we had all our doubts cleared and she explained all the aspects in detail.  She was immediately responsive for all our minor doubts anytime through whatsapp which I think is great support! while she may seem to be super fast in her approach which is needed for her busy schedule, she was patient enough to explain.2. *** ** **** ************* *** *** ***** ** ********* ** **** ***** *** ******** my wife was prescribed with Ecosprin tablets in the initial weeks by the previous doctor. But when we consulted her, she clearly explained why that tablet was not needed at that stage of pregnancy and helped us out from getting any side effects.3. My wife wanted natural delivery and her guidance and support really helped us. She confidently told us it will happen and suggested my wife to follow her guidance. let it be the diet and exercise (especially squats). it was really helpful. it was because of her my wife had natural delivery even when she had back labour and without epidural.

She is so friendly and take care of each patient very personally and still remember the condition of every patient.\n     When I was 2 months pregnant I had bleeding problem and visited X hospital with one of the doctor instead of consoling or treating she was scolding treated me so badly in my first visit itself I was thinking OMG till 9 months should I visit this doctor.Done with scan and blood test with much difficulty and duty doctor told me that I have gestational diabetes and suggested to come in morning and doctor will start insulin.I was shocked and confused and without second thought she want to start insulin, then me and my husband decided to take an another opinion\n  \n     we started searching for an another doctor and one of my friend suggested Dr Manjula Deepak mam.... In my first visit manjula madam spoke so nicely and gave so much confidence that no need of insulin and can be controlled through proper diet. I was having both hypertension and gestational diabetes. During my first visit with Mam I felt so good and felt am in safe hands.Mam explained my health condition very clearly made me feel relaxed and gave confident. In every visit mam took care of me so nicely... After 8th month my BP started fluctuating day by day but doctor has given an indication about this in prior to me and my husband and to follow just the instructions given. After 35week every week Mam told to visit frequently and in 36week my bp was getting high n fluid was very low. Next day early morning I got slight pain and messaged mam... Mam asked me to come immediately to hospital and when we reached hospital mam also came immediately and pains started getting more and within two hour delivered my Lil princess. In spite of my health conditions and complications during my pregnancy Manjula Mam made it so easy and I had normal delivery.   Its a big story but worth writing it just because of Manjula Deepak mam\n\nThose who are searching for good gynaecologist without single thought please consult Dr. Manjula deepak - Cloud Nine Hospital.\n",

From our first visit to confirm pregnancy, me and my husband were sure that we were in the safest hands. Her energy and smile keep every pregnant woman relaxed. Some doctors make pregnancy such a big issue, but Manjula mam will make it feel like such a smooth journey. Be it diet, physical activity or tests and scans, we never listened to anyone's advise apart from Manjula mam's. Whenever I used to feel worried about any findings in tests or scans, afer visiting mam, I used to feel relaxed and assured that everything is going to be fine. *** ***** ********* *********** ***** ** ***** ** ********** She always encourages normal delivery and suggests physical activity and diet for the same. But as my baby was in breech position, I have to go for c-section. Anyway it didn't matter to me since all I wanted is healthy and safe delivery of my baby. Mam asked us only to decide date and time. And she performed c-section on the exact date and time that we had decided. We got blessed with cute lil baby girl on 16th April. We feel so fortunate that we consulted Dr. Manjula Deepak. She is working 24/7 on this covid-19 situation as well. She is the most committed and humble doctor we have ever seen. I feel short of words to describe her. I would recommend Manjula mam to every pregnant woman. Thank you so much mam for making our pregnancy journey so smooth and beautiful!! From Megha & Anil..",

May God bless her and may she achieve all the success in life - That's my entire family's and my prayer for her!!!",

In her first consultation she told us that you are perfectly fine and you don't have any PCOD problem for you age and suggested to follow diet which bought positive vibes in us after that it was going smooth and good till third month scan, we were disappointed with the result which showed low PaP (where baby will be born with down syndrome defect) so she suggested to take NIPT test which was quite expensive, so she let us to take decision on our own since it was expensive also she guaranteed the result would be normal and no need to worry, still we went with the test and it came negative and we were little happy, but since her PaP value was low it would be quite difficult to have normal delivery, Doctor assured us she will try for normal delivery and suggest to follow some of home remedies and exercises instead of giving more  tablets and bare minimum consultation, each time we consult her, we came out or she filled positivty in us, and as the day was nearing to delivery, we were tesnsed and she calmed us by delivering a baby normally as assured earlier. She was very kind, friendly, caring, cooperative with us. We are totaly satisfied with Dr Manjula Deepak and we recommend my brother and sister to consult her also we recommend to our friends in future, she brought back happiness in our lives...

I would say she's my Angel, when I was in a mindset that I'm not going to have baby due to PCOD issues but then she turned out everything to a positive do... I've been treated for PCOD from 2 long years and I couldn't concieve because of that .I tried changing different gynaecologists to get this problem treated but nothing worked out when ever I meet the new gyni the first thing they would say is try for anv IVF getting pregnant is not possible with medication for PCOD this made me get so depressed and frustrated and that is the time when I met dr manjula her only magic is think positive and her positive Vibes makes us think everything positive... And the most wonderful thing is she just put me on 3 months course and the medicine she prescribed me was more of multivitamins and healthy tablets which doesn't even cause any side effects. And yes on the third month of course it was a boom I was pregnant... Dr Manjula made it happen she's such a beautiful person who's always sweet and polite with her patients with a complete package of positiveness and anytime we can reach her for doubts she tries to respond even during a busy schedule... And one of the major thing about her is she always prefers for normal vaginal delivery I was conceived with placenta previa where in normal delivery was not an easy task for my complications and offcourse yes I had a normal delivery... But since the day I concievied the only thing she use to say is your going to have a normal vaginal delivery despite any complications... That was such a positive boost for me and this is to all the women's who's trying to conceive from a very long time due to Hormonal and infertility issues please do visit Dr Manjula atleast once and I swear that's gonna change your life she's an Angel to all the women's out ther... Anyways I'm gonna stop for now.. because I won't stop if I have to speak about Dr Manjula it just goes on and on ..Love u doc and thank you so much for making me feel complete... This compliment is also on behalf of sister Helen and Chris .. \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc93",

After reading some of the reviews, I thought they must be paid ones. But looking at the number of reviews, I was convinced that they are not. So, we decided to go ahead with Manjula mam, even though cashless insurance facility (for the medical insurance I had) was not available in that hospital.Before consulting Dr. Manjula for the first time, I had lots of questions in mind, which I listed down, so that I could ask her. We met the doctor and realized that all the review comments about her are really true. We felt as if we are talking to one of our friends, rather than doctor. She is such a friendly and nice person, having lots of patience to explain us each and everything. Her explanation covered all my questions and I didn't have to ask them. So we decided to stay with the same doctor and not to switch to anyone else.Meanwhile my wife had some problem in the early third month, which was putting her pregnancy under risk. Dr. Manjula mam monitored my wife's condition closely and solved the problem. She even shared her personal mobile number to contact her directly under any emergency. *** ****** ******* *********** *********** ****** ******** ** ** **** **** **** ******* *** ********* She was preparing my wife for normal delivery.Later my baby had some complications, which forced doctor to deliver the baby at 32 weeks. It was not a surprise for us, as doctor had explained us this situation and was monitoring from few weeks back. She wanted to keep the baby in the womb, as long as possible.My wife delivered a boy baby on 8th March 2020 and she is doing fine. Baby is still in intensive care unit, but he is also doing very good. Hopefully he will be discharged very soon.Thanks a lot Manjula mam for all the support, care and the courage you have given to us. You will be remembered always by me and my wife.-Bharath and Chaitra",

She always carries her charming face with smile, which always encouraged me during my pregnancy. Due to her continuous support, even the toughest time was also smooth going. She always replies over whatsapp round the clock. She is a bundle of energy and she manages her team so well that under her guidance, all takes care of the patient like a family member. At the time of my labour which was early morning , we informed Ma'am over phone , and she might had just got up but guess what , once we reached hospital within few minutes of time she was there with me ,which gave me a confidence that I am in a safe hand. She is really sincere and dedicated to her job. In the labour room, I almost left hope that I could bear more pain to have normal delivery \u2026 I even asked Ma'am that I can\u2019t bear more pain, please go ahead with C-section \u2026 But Ma'am smiled and told keep quiet and do not worry and I had Normal delivery . Since the beginning, she always insisted to have normal delivery and if you follow her instructions properly and with God grace if everything goes fine, then one can surely have Normal delivery \u2026  Thank you so much Manjula Ma'am and your full team. Finally, I would like to say some words about Cloud9 HRBR branch \u2026 During my journey of pregnancy all the doctors , nurses , Lab in charges , receptionists were very co-operative and always willing to help. I would like to thank Cloud9 for managing such a wonderful facility for all Mothers like us \u2026\n",

Hospital provided Manjula mam's appointment(we now feel really lucky for that). On our first meeting itself, she made us absolutely  relaxed with her friendliness and the way she explained things. She talked to us with such a positivity that we felt pregnancy can be made less stressful. When we left the hospital after the first visit, we decided to continue with Manjula mam for the rest of the pregnancy. I have seen my friends going to different doctors for second opinion and third opinion , we never had to do that at any point of time.\n\nThese are some of the things which really helped us-\n\n1) she explain things very clearly. Most of our question which we prepared got answered before we ask.\n2)Answers were very specific. if we ask whether we can do something, she  either say 'yes' or 'no'. This was most helpful as we have seen doctors confuse people by leaving a choice to the patient by saying pros and cons of our action. Here she had taken decisions for us and we just need to follow whatever she say.\n3)Although she is very busy, she gave ample time for everyone and made sure we leave her room with clear state of mind.\n\nHer importance was completely realized on the day of delivery. There was a duty doctor who made me totally panic saying there is some complication. Later I met Manjula mam and she said nothing to worry and delivered the baby in 15 minutes. I thanked God for sending us to the right doctor and I believe God deliver his wishes through doctor's hands.\n",

From the first appointment, I knew she\u2019s the one I will be consulting for my next pregnancy. After so much of trauma and depression, Dr.Manjula has boosted my confidence drastically and Put a smile on my face with her words and assurance about a successful pregnancy. Her positive energy and friendliness towards her patients makes the environment light and relieving. Throughout my pregnancy journey, she kept me informed about each and every detail as to why she is prescribing the medicine,why she\u2019s asking to avoid a particular food etc.. also she would interact with my husband and mom to make them feel comfortable and answer their doubts too. She encourages all her patients for a normal delivery and is  always reachable on phone or whatsapp for any doubts starting from day ** *** ***** ********** *********** ********* ** ***** *** asks for a scan only when it is required.After seeing so many other practitioners with limited interactions with the patients and who are always In a hurry, she feels like a guardian angel for me. An appointment with Dr.Manjula was never dull and her energy is contagious. Her ability to speak English, Hindi , Telugu,Kannada And Tamil makes you feel comfortable to speak with her in your choice of language. when it\u2019s difficult to find a good doctor who genuinely cares for her patients these days in Bangalore, i have spread the word about Dr.Manjula to as many women as possible to visit her for their pregnancy and other fertility related issues as i want them to benefit from this doctor . I would really miss meeting her and may many people get benefitted with her service in and around HRBR layout. In case, you are someone staying little away from the hospital, it\u2019s totally worth a shot to pay her a visit and you wouldn\u2019t regret travelling the distance for the consultation. Thank you Manjula ma\u2019am for all your support in bringing out our bundle of joy into this world without any complications. May the world be filled with more and more doctors like\nYou! \n\n-\u2014\nMonisha And Rohit",

We had met her after unfortunate miscarriage in 5th month of pregnancy, it was then she promised us that next time she would give our baby in our hands. That assurance was simply amazing as it did give us ample confidence and belief that we soon will be able to experience parenthood. Our son came to this world in Dec 2016.\nAnd I am writing the review for her again as on 30th October 2019, we welcomed our 2nd son. We are grateful to Dr Manjula again for helping us second time. In last about 4 years, we haven\u2019t had to see any other gynecologist and obstetrician as we have tremendous belief in Dr Manjula. She has delivered our second baby, this itself is a testimony to what kind of trust we have in her. \nNormally, pregnancy is a very natural process however we have had to face some of the very ugly challenges because of some complications. My wife was diagnosed with gestational diabetes quite early in pregnancy, then we had to struggle with my wife\u2019s Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP). Unfortunately, both these challenges were there in both pregnancies and Dr Manjula was quite helpful and extremely motivational during entire period. She was very clear in her explanations and we never had any doubt on what was being done. We are highly impressed by the way she handles complicated issues, gives confidence to people like us.  Dr Manjula has been very reachable whenever we had any doubts/questions, she possesses an amazing energy level.  Highly recommended.\n",

I visited her first time long back in 2013 during my first pregnancy when she was practicing in Medihope hospital. Being my first pregnancy, I had lot of queries and nervousness and she cared for me very well The best thing I liked about her was her positive attitude and confidence that she imparts in her patients. Hence after many years when I became pregnant the second time, I only wanted to consult Dr. Manjula, even though now she had shifted to Cloudnine which was a bit far from my home. She takes utmost care of her patients, and remembers their case history and gives the best treatment even in case of high risk pregnancies. She will always tell me exercises to do and walking for a natural labor and delivery.She never prescribed any unnecessary medications or scares a patient with reports - it is always a very pleasant experience to meet her. I am so thankful to her for both my children - the first one is now 5 years old and the second one who was delivered by her in Cloudnine recently. Both deliveries were normal and kids were born healthy full term. She is very helpful and will always reply to any concerns on whatsapp and be there in case of emergency. Labor can be quite unpredictable, and Dr. Manjula was always there is guide me on phone and also came to hospital no matter the odd hours and without worrying about her own family. She is doing God's work and I wish her to stay blessed.  \nMy little one is now 3 months old, sorry for the late review. Lots of Blessings and love - Sneha :)",

Words might fall short to express my gratitude towards her, she is extremely down to earth, very positive and of friendly nature. She patiently listens and clear out our doubts and concerns. We felt very comfortable in discussing our issues. This was my first pregnancy and I have been very grateful that I consulted Dr. Manjula. She took care of every aspects of the pregnancy, she gave me confidence and took care of me very well. My mom was very much impressed by way of handling issues, she is full of life and very jolly in nature. \n\nI got gestational diabetics at 22nd week which made me depressed but she did proper counseling and made sure that i shouldn\u2019t be worried. She is strict when it comes to exercise  which helped me during delivery, I had a normal delivery with 12 hours labor and diabetes. We are blessed with baby boy and both of us were hale and healthy. The amount of support she provided during labor was truly commendable, I feel because of her I was able to bear take up 12 hours labor pain, if it was someone else then I would definitely gone for C-Section. I belong to north Karnataka region and most of the babies born are with C-Section, everyone even the my family doctor was shocked that I had a normal delivery. This was possible only because of Manjula Mam, it is said that doctors are next to god and she truly is that person.\n\nI was able to get first hug of my baby immediately after delivery, I was able to sit and function normally within 2 hours of delivery. She is very dedicated and takes her profession seriously. She is the only doctor I have seen who thinks her profession is a Blessing and took it as a Service to mankind. \n\nI strongly recommend Dr. Manjula Deepak to each and everyone and if you are consulting her then forget all your worries as she will take care of you and your baby. Also post delivery she will recommend best Peadiatric doctor as well. She is an amazing human being, I love her way of treating patients. She is the Best",

My pregnancy was not a cake walk for me I had a lots of complications through out my pregnancy but I never loose my hope only because of Madam(Dr. Manjula Deepak). I had Gestational diabetes,High BP, Bleeding issues during my pregnancy.Whenever I used to see her  face I used to feel relaxed...I used to know \"now Madam is here she will do what is best for me\".I used to wait eagerly for my visit so that I can meet her because I always used to get a positive energy after meeting her my mind used to get relaxed when I step out of her chamber. Whenever I had any health issues through out my pregnancy madam was always available. She is always active on whatsup and will immediately respond to the queries. I had to underwent an emergency scan due to bleeding during my 4th month Manjula madam was \npresent during the scan even that day she came early to the hospital when Radiologist ask regarding my medical history Madam only told everything in details even the name of the medicine I am taking...that moment I felt she is not only my Doctor but someone from my family who knows everything in details. Throughout my whole pregnancy she always guided me she never make me feel tensed. She even answer all my silly questions.She will listen to the patients carefully till our doubts or queries are over. Though Madam told me to try for Normal delivery but I was scared so I was willing for C-section and Madam supported my decision she never force me.I am blessed with a baby girl she is one month now. I am little late to write the review (sorry). Thank you madam for  all your support. I always pray to Almighty for your well-being.Will miss U alot. Thank and  Regards from Ashnika-Arup &  our princess Aarika.",

She is always available on phone and instantly responds  to all our queries. She prefers natural home remedies instead of medicines. I had to get hospitalized due to severe head ache and fever at 16 weeks. Doctor was out of station for a conference. But she made sure I was in right hands and she even asked one of her friend who was a neuro to personally check me. After that all my consultations and scans went smooth. At 38 weeks check up, she checked my cervix and told me that it is closed tightly and advised some exercises which will induce labor naturally.  But those exercises did not help and even after a week, my cervix was still tightly closed. Doctor asked me to get admitted and she said she will be inducing the same day and if no progress by next day we had to go for a C-section. I was induced the same day I got admitted after which I was in pain from the cervical exam. The next day again she made sure she herself did the cervical exam and informed me that the gel did not work and that I need to undergo C-section. Finally she delivered my little angel at 8 am. After the delivery, she informed my family who was eagerly waiting outside to hear the good news. Also she made sure the nurses took the baby outside to show her to my family. Her positivity gave me strength to recover quickly . She was one of my greatest support during my pregnancy and I would like to thank her for everything. ",

She is highly experienced, friendly and approachable. She explains things and also makes sure to answer all your doubts. I had anxieties and worries during my pregnancy but whenever I visited her I used to come back feeling so positive and happy. I think I sometimes secretly wanted the visits to be more frequent just for the positive effect she instilled. And it's really commendable and sweet of her to remember her patients by name and also small incidents related to them. (Like she remembered meeting us in the Bangalore midnight marathon run during my first trimester and she did bring that up during my c section surgery which surely was a sweet distraction). She takes care of her patients very dedicatedly. During my 8th month one of the days we got worried due to reduced foetal movements and I messaged her. She asked us to observe it for a couple of hours and we were pleasantly surprised Nd relieved too when she herself msgd us back in 2 hours to check the status and asked us to come to hospital where she ensured to take out time from her busy schedule to do the necessary scans and tests to ensure everything was fine and put our mind at peace. \nDr Manjula is a great advocate of natural vaginal delivery and prepares u for the same Thought I however had to go through an emergency C-section as my water broke and my body was not going into labor even after 7 hours of wait while baby's heart rate was fluctuating. Coincidentally Dr had to go to another branch the same day due some important reason but she ensured to put me in right hands till she returned and was in touch with the doctor in charge to take timely status updates. She rushed back and performed the surgery within minutes of her arrival and delivered our little bundle of joy, our greatest blessing , our daughter - Tanvi. We would really like to thank Dr Manjula for taking great care of us and being the person she is. I happily recommend her to my friends and family and will surely recommend her to anyone looking for a great gynecologist :). Thank you doctor!\nThanks and regards, \nPuja, Balmiki and Tanvi \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

I am not saying we didn\u2019t have challenges, but she was available all the time whatsapp, call or in person. We had multiple occasion when my wife was admitted in cloud nine or in other hospital and she made sure that she was there to see her in person and my wife was taken utmost care in cloud nine or in the other hospital. She went an extra mile and asked the doctor in other hospital too to make sure I am okay and inform her if any challenge is there. She left nothing to chance. We will always be indebted to her to make our pregnancy as smooth as possible. I would suggest to the people who are looking forward to getting pregnant meet her once and I am sure it will be worth it. The charisma and chutzpah that you can see once you meet her is incomparable. I can still count on her if I need any medical help regarding my wife. I thank her again and wish her luck.",

From day 1 it was a phenomenal journey for us and we have no words to express how it went well.She is always available on WhatsApp and calls for the silliest doubts you may have at any hour of the day. \nDuring each visit we were explained in depth about the status of growth and well being of the baby and me. I may expect in the upcoming days or weeks which actually reduced the anxiety when I really faced it. Unlike many other doctors who advise for unnecessary blood tests and check up, she always did only when necessary. She always encouraged me for a normal delivery. Now our angel is one week old and healthy. My whole family is very grateful to her. I would recommend every expecting mother to get treated under Manjula madam, because she is a combination of ******* ********** dedication and experience.\nI and my husband thank her for making us proud parent of our son. Thanks manjula madam for giving us our bundle of joy, we sincerely pray to God for your long life, well being and a great life ahead, we pray a healthy,prosperous and great life for your family as well.\nMuch love... \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00",

Also, you can imagine how much we owe to her to still remember in writing this up.\n\nDr. Manjula Deepak is such a positive, extremely down to earth, very caring, very friendly doctor. She patiently clears all our doubts and concerns . From day 1 of my pregnancy we were consulting Dr.Manjula. First day itself she told us this is her baby and she will take care of me and my baby. I was so tensed because of previous history of preterm delivery at 34th week and a miscarriage ,but once we met Dr.Manjula, she gave us the confidence and took proper care of me and everything went really well and we were blessed with a baby girl on 23rd March. it is only because of her, that my entire pregnancy period went really well without any tensions, because she knew how to keep us confident.\n\nShe has deep knowledge and her timely advice and actions really helped me. She will never make us tensed and she knows what to do. *** ** ****** ******* **** ********** She is available in both WhatsApp and call even at night also.\n\nDue to some unluck , she was not there during my delivery as she had to attend some conference abroad and the same day some complication happened. But best part was, she was still available over message and she directed us what to do and whom to contact in Cloudnine. She had already appraised of my condition to another doctor before she left. She ensured that I was taken proper care of and it is her timely advice that saved life of both me and my baby. Everything went well by God\u2019s grace. Dr.Manjula was constantly in touch with us to know how we were doing and when she returned back, that morning itself she came and met us.\n\nWe are thanking you from bottom of our heart for bringing all these cheers into our life and god will always bless you..***  *** *** **** ****** ** *** ***** ******\n\nWe strongly recommend Dr.Manjula Deepak to everyone..and if you are consulting her, there is nothing to worry as she will take care of you and your little one like an elder sister.\n\nBig kudos to all the staffs of Cloudnine Horamavu as well, as they took care of me and my baby in a really awesome way.\n\nBest regards,\nAnakha and Arjun",

Though late I could not stop myself from giving feedback on Dr. Manjula as there is no other way we could express our gratitude. Dr. Manjula is a very professional,  positive and an energetic person who gives her 100% in putting the health of the patient first. In a city like Bangalore, we were initially confused whom to consult for our pregnancy and it was much beyond luck that we ended up in chosing  treatment under Dr. Manjula. Right from day 1 it was a wonderful journey for us and we have no words to describe how it went well. She understands the patient's need,  clears whatever doubts we have and most importantly she is approachable at any given time. During each visit we were explained in depth about the status of growth and well being of the baby and me. In addition I was given the glimpse of the symptoms that I may expect in the upcoming days or weeks which actually reduced the anxiety when I really faced it. Unlike many other doctors who advise for unnecessary blood tests and check up, she always did only when necessary. She always encouraged me for a normal delivery.  It was good to be treated with professionalism and care. Her approach and treatment regimen made us feel that we were in safe hands. We never wanted to miss out on her treatment and so we did not even go to our maternal home for delivery during the 7th month as per our tradition. Dr. Manjula explained about the diet/calorie intake, exercise pattern throughout pregnancy which helped me to have a healthy weight gain for me and baby.  On the day of delivery, once I called her informed about the symptoms which I experienced she waited at the hospital during midnight, beyond her working hours to check on me. Under her care I was able to deliver a healthy active baby through a normal delivery in a very short delivery time compared to what I observed in my friend circle.  Her way of treating me was excellent with utmost professionalism. I received the best quality care and had a quick recovery phase. We as a couple really trusted her and our experience with her was awesome. Our princess is now 1.5 month old and we have no words to express our gratitude towards Dr. Manjula. \n\nThank You so much doctor! We are short of words to thank you.\nWe as a couple strongly recommend her. \n\nRegards, \nDineesha & Anand",

After having a bad experience due to lack of time, attention and patience from the doctor, we decided to change to Dr. Manjula Deepak at the same hospital. The reason being her charm and the care with which she used to call every patient by name and smile everytime she is walking around the hospital.\nChoosing Dr. Manjula was the best decision we ever made in our pregnancy - right from the first appointment I was sure I'm in safe hands. She was so patient to listen to all of your doubts and concerns and then explain all details at every stage of pregnancy- from  diet, exercise and all the investigations required. Despite being extremely busy, she still made time to walk into my scans just to be doubly sure about my condition and reassure me of how me and my baby are doing. She is always available on WhatsApp and calls for the silliest doubts you may have at any hour of the day.\nShe is extremely friendly and I was never anxious before my appointments with Ma'am - just happy. She always encourages and tries her best for a normal delivery while always prioritizing the health of the mother and child. My husband and entire family were happy with ma'am's guidance throughout my pregnancy.\nI know that I'm not the easiest patient to handle considering how emotional I can get at times and the kind of pessimist that I am. But, it was only Dr. Manjula's patience and care that helped me sail through my pregnancy with so much ease.\nOur little Angel is one week old today and my entire family is extremely grateful and thankful to Dr. Manjula for the great doctor that she is but more importantly  a wonderful human being. \u263a if you are on your pregnancy journey, choose Dr. Manjula and you'll surely be very happy and safe.\n\n-Malavikha and Pramod",

I can't stop myself to write review for this amazing doctor.\n\nLike everyone else I was very scared about pregnancy. While I was searching for good doctor, I have come across Dr Manjula and at the very 1st consultation I decided to continue my pregnancy journey with her. We used to travel from whitefield to HRBR cloudnine to consult her. Eventhough it is far from my place never hesitated to travel. Once I see her face and talk to her I forget all my worries. She is very energitic with lots of possitive vibes. Even though there are minor disturbances in the scans some times, she never scared us and explained everything in detail. Just trust her 100 % and leave everything to her. She will take care. Best part is she takes the calls and replies in watsapp for any queries. When ever she explains something , I always felt like as if I am talking to my sister or mother but never felt like I am talking to a Doctor. Somehow I am attached to her and really missing her now. I have never seen any doctor who encourages you to exercise like this. I followed all the exercises, tips and food recomonded by her which helped me to get natural pains without inducing, dilated fast and delivered normally in short time. She will try her best for normal delivery. I feel blessed to find Dr manjula and deliver in her hands. I will definitely recommend her to all my friends and family.\n\nWe will be grateful to you Doctor for safely delivering our baby. We wish you reach great heights in future. We will pray for great health wealth and never ending happiness to you and your family.\n\n--- Srilakshmi & Santosh",

Its a bliss to meet her at the most needed hour. I am very scared of hospitals and doctors and having met her I felt so comfortable with her that I used to enjoy meeting her at every consultation; There were no unnecessary tests recommended and no extra medicines prescribed. Even if there is any issue in the scan she never scared me but at the same time, used to get the things fixed. At one instance I was somehow worried about the growth of my baby inside and visited her before scan date, and I remember she was also equally worried for me , came with me to scan room , leaving all her appointments for some time and ensured every thing was fine . I felt very nice of her having shared my pain. She was  always available for me over phone and whatsapp and that is of big help during my pregnancy. \nOn the delivery day I messaged her at early morning 3 o clock with my symptoms and even at that time she managed to respond and was also available at the hospital early in the morning; And it was a normal delivery with no complications , again thanks to the exercises she recommended;\nShe adds so much comfort to the patients that it is very difficult to get off her. I would strongly strongly recommend her for a smooth , tension free pregnancy.\nMy Mil is a big fan of her that she would recommend Dr.Manjula to the people of other towns and cities also. :)\nI am very very lucky to meet her.\nThank you Dr. Manjula Deepak from me , my family and from my little one;\nMay god bless you and your family with all the happiness and may you stay happy and energetic for many more years:)",

I had many complications during my pregnancy but Dr. Manjula made my pregnancy journey so smooth that now I don't even remember the trobules during my pregnancy. Let me tell you my pregnancy story. Before planning our baby we visited another doctor and had some fertility tests. In those tests my AMH level came below normal and that doctor suggested us to plan as soon as possible. However, we were not ready and waited for 1 year at that time. When we thought of planning a baby, we visited cloud nine on April 2018 and guess what we got appointment with Dr. Manjula. She explained everything in detail and assured us that we should not worry about the fertility test for now and try naturally first. On May 15, we again met Dr. Manjula and this time with positive pregnancy test. She shared her number at that time. Since it was my first pregnancy, I had many queries which she used to answer patiently over messages or calls.  I must say she is 24*7 available for her patients which shows her commitment towards mothers and her passion towards her profession. After 45 days, I developed hypermesis gravidarum which is extreme nausea and vomiting. I used to vomit 20 times a day and nothing was staying in my stomach. That phase was difficult for me but I used to return with positive mind whenever I visited her. This went till 4th month of pregnancy. Later in the third trimester, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Again, Dr. Manjula calmed me and motivated me to eat healthy. She negotiated that phase with me in cool and calm manner. Due to earlier complications and gestational diabetes, the growth of baby was sub-par, but Dr. Manjula delivered the baby on 25th December 2018 with no further hiccups. I still remember the moment when she told me \"your little Santa is here..\". She was thorough and professional in her approach which we admire. She was calm and composed and never let us panic. We would surely recommend her.",

Through the course of the last 18 months, she has been right by my side for\n- Recommending non-hormonal medication to help get pregnant\n- Diagnosing that I had polyps and recommending a surgery to remove them \n- Managing the surgery\n- Post operation care\n- Consultation through my entire pregnancy (including suggesting i meet the dietitian and physiotherapist to ensure that i have a normal delivery)\n- Delivery of my baby girl on September 10th\n- and finally, post pregnancy care\n\nDr. Manjula is great! There is no other way to put it.  She listens to you, recommends things that SUIT YOU and always looks at natural remedies before suggesting medication.  Her first and second step of treatment is always household things and medication is suggested only after things do not work using natural remedies.\n\nShe has a million patients (I am guessing :)) and is in and out of deliveries a lot but will always reply to your WhatsApp msg within 30 minutes (that is the most she has taken).  \n\nShe was ALWAYS available for us when we had questions and listened patiently.  On some occasions when she couldn't come to the hospital/clinic, she would let duty staff know exactly what to do and talk to you to tell you what the nursing staff would do.\n\nAt a time where you hear that doctors prefer C-sections, Dr. Manjula still pushes for normal delivery and works with you over 9 months to ensure that you do everything that you possibly can to make your own delivery smooth. In my case as well, she waited the recommended time to try and push for a NVD but as it had been about 16 hours since my water broke, she didnt have a choice and had to do a C-section.\n\nI admire her passion to her job and patients and her energy levels :).  She is always smiling and positive.\n\nIf you are looking for a OB/GYN and Cloudnine Hormavu is a decent distance for you, I recommend you go see her right away.\n\nThanks Dr.Manjula\nDeepak, Ritika and Aria <3\n\nPS: Thank you Practo for recommending Dr. Manjula when I was looking for OB/GYNs \n",

Availability to clarify questions and concerns\n3. Friendly nature\n\nWe came across Dr. Manjula through Practo and based upon that we decided to consult her for pregnancy. I would say the amazing feedback what we read in Practo is not exaggerated. From the first visit, doctor made us comfortable, explained the complications involved and waiting time to decide the pregnancy forward. With every visit, we gained more confidence and she educated us on the current conditions. With excellent medical care and with gods grace, we are now proud parents of a baby girl.\n\nAll the check-ups, scans and tests were absolutely normal there after, doctor advised on every minute medical attention needed. Major factor was on controlling the baby weight, the diet to follow.\n\nAnother important factor is the approachability, always available on phone (calls and WatsApp). This is one of the biggest factor, the immediate response from doctor, the kind of attention we get from those responses were very much need of the hour. Doctor had handled this soft aspect on medical care amazingly. Even at odd hours at night, doctor had responded to our queries, gave the advices.\n\nVery energetic, positive attitude, easily approchable and the bonding she makes with patient, the way she calls by name....I had never seen any other doctor doing it. This makes me feel doctor better every time and avoid anxiousness.\n\nDoctor also insisted us on normal delivery, as we were bit worried about the preivous delivery impacts. When the big day advances, she made us feel absolutely comfortable and normal delivery within 1 hour after reaching the hospital. \n\nOur family is very much satisfied and thankful to the doctor, we wish doctor could create more and more happy mothers and families.\n\nBIG THANKS again from the bottom of our heart. Repti & Bijoy\n\n",

But with the first visit with Dr. Manjula; we realized we could bank on her. \n\nWe had a rough initial 3 months of pregnancy, to say the least; especially with the bleeding and passing of clots. During all this; the only hope for us was Doctors\u2019 words \u201cThis is all normal.. nothing to worry..\u201d I have probably troubled her the most during the first 3-4 months with constant whatsapp messages/calls. I used to be so hassled; that I would whatsapp her at least 3 times a week in addition to the queries/doubts during my routine monthly visits. Even with her busy schedule, she has always replied to all of my messages/calls and that always put me at ease. \n\nShe has always been a very jovial and a very optimistic person to us. We used to drive from far and never ever thought of changing our doctor; coz we got very used to her optimistic responses and clear cut consultations. \nShe would always try and make sure that we didn\u2019t drive a lot because of the distance and would also make sure that we don\u2019t do any unnecessary tests. \n\nShe has been so approachable throughout; that we even ended up calling her at midnight, during the day of our childbirth. She made sure; that we were taken good care of when we reached the hospital for the emergency. We ended up having a normal delivery and that is all thanks to Dr. Manjula, because I reached a stage of labour pain where I started requesting Dr., to do a C-Sec. Only due to Dr. Manjula\u2019s faith and persistence did we have a normal delivery. \n\n*** ** *** **** ****** ****** ***** **** *** **** The first thing that she asked us in our first visit was to trust her; and that is all that one needs to do with a doctor like her.\n\nI was feeling a bit emotional today; coz I might now see her only after 6 months. I hope to keep in touch with you Doctor. Thanks for being the guiding light and the constant support throughout our pregnancy. We would probably not have endured it; had it not been you.\n\nThank you so much Doctor..\n\nMaya & Anish",

Alas, we chanced upon Dr. Manjula Deepak and she was all that I was looking for in a doctor!\n\nShe's so chirpy and humble that she puts you at ease immediately. One of the best things about her is that she knows all her patients by their names (which is a very rare trait for a doctor of her calibre these days!). \n\nSince I'm not the type who would refer to google to get answers on my health/pregnancy, Dr. Manjula Deepak was so patient with us and answered all our questions which I would usually write down and take during our appointment! Moreover, she was available 6 days a week at the clinic and forever available over a text message whenever I would panic about anything or if I missed asking her any particular question during the appointment.  \n\nShe has a very modern approach to pregnancy which breaks most stereotypes and I was glad that she encouraged me to go on with my daily life without making me feel like I was 'sick' and needed to restrain myself from doing anything. I thoroughly enjoyed my pregnancy under her guidance. During the course of my pregnancy I rode a bike, I travelled overseas, did long road trips,  drove to work until the 9th month, went for swims, exercised and even baked a cake the night before I was admitted! :) \n\nShe is a very earnest, humble, friendly *** ************* doctor. I had a complication at the time of my labour and had to undergo an emergency C-section. But even through that phase Dr. Manjula comforted me and prepared me for a safe and healthy delivery. \n\nWe are always grateful for all the encouragement and support Dr. Manjula offered us during our pregnancy. Our baby girl arrived on December 20th, 2017 and it was by far the best Christmas we ever celebrated! \n\nThank you so much Doctor, you are a rockstar! \n\nLove,\nSteffi D'souza and Sanjeeth Samuel",

So we ended up paying numerous visits to doctors,gynacs etc. She did 3 Ivfs and 4 iuis all of which failed. We had given up all hopes of becoming parents when GOD answered us. My wife conceived naturally and we were extremely happy. So we ended up visiting Dr. Manjula without checking her experience etc. It was an enriching experience for us. She looked very casual and happy go-like person, quite unlike other doctors that we came across. She explained to us everything and took us into confidence. My wife is very inquisitive and analytical in her approach. So she asked her a lot of questions which Dr. Manjula answered with ease. We were extremely pleased with her personality,confidence and ease with which we could speak and approach her. Next during the entire period of pregnancy my wife used to call her, WhatsApp her at any time during day and night and she would reply back. This was really amazing considering that she is a busy doctor. Our delivery due date was around mid-April and we were planning for the same. However on the evening of April 2, my wife started having labor pain and we admitted her. Late at night she started having a lot of pain. Dr. Manjula arrived at 5am in morning and delivered my baby girl - angel. During labor my baby,s heart beat was erratic so Dr. Manjula took no chances and immediately took my wife to the delivery room and in no time she delivered. We admire her pragmatic decision and steadfastness. She is a very good doctor and we are obliged that she has helped us all the way. We can never forget this. We would like to recommend her to any couple who would like to have a baby. Thank you Doctor Manjula.......Amit Goswami and Somosree Banerjee ",

I booked an appointment with both, but as luck would have it I went to see Dr Manjula first and after that very first visit I knew she would be the perfect doctor for me and I never went to see anyone else. \n\nI had a normal delivery without epidural on Jan 22, 2018 and the whole experience from that first month of pregnancy till my visit post delivery have been very good. Doctor Manjula makes everything easier. The best things about her are that she's reachable, I used to text her whenever in doubt or facing any difficulty and she never failed to address my concern. Another great thing about Dr is that she is not fussy at all and respects her patient's choices. I had a completely vegan pregnancy and although it's not a common thing in India, she was fine with it as long as my test results were good and I was eating healthy. \nDr Manjula also put my mind to ease a lot of times. As it was my first pregnancy I got a lot of advice from people in my life and whenever in doubt I used to check with her regarding what should I do. I liked that she was clear about what all are myths and what is sound advice. She's a good blend of modern medicine and age old wisdom. Another great thing about her is that she kept my husband involved in the entire pregnancy and he was present for all my appointments and during the delivery. He too felt calmer in her presence. We both trust her immensely and are glad we found her. \n\nIt's always a pleasure to meet the ever smiling Dr Manjula. Thank you for everything!",

As the days passed, I got certain complications like spotting (and lumps) in initial days of pregnancy which lasted for almost 10-15 days and Dr Manjula asked me to take a tablet to stop spotting and sustain the pregnancy. I was also asked for a bedrest for 1-2 weeks after which spotting subsided. My dr. was always positive on me and never lost any hope. She always asked me NOT to Google anything and to always stay calm and happy. She believed in miracles and nature and so did I. I just followed her instructions and had supreme faith in my God. But my spotting was on and off till 3 months and I was always tensed on that. That\u2019s not the end! Other complications like cystic swelling in umbilical chord, cyst in placenta, low lying placenta and a single umbilical artery were also diagnosed in 1st trimester scans..Due to these, I was asked to go through NIPT scan instead of double marker Test to check for the chromosomes related disorder. By grace of god, the reports were normal and also by the 2nd trimester the cysts were not visible. Even the placenta position was high. Spotting was totally stopped and then my pregnancy went smoothly apart from some normal ups and downs like urine infection in 2nd trimester, abdominal pain due to gas some days and other normal symptoms. Every now and then I used to reach hospital to get the scan done and Dr Manjula was like \u2018I am a gone case\u2019 by now\ud83d\ude0a My husband and I used to get tensed so much that we just used to rush hospital without giving a second thought. And Mam was always available on WhatsApp and in hospital no matter what. She always responded to me immediately even in her super busy routine. She is really supportive and friendly and boosts your positivity and motivation level. I always got positive vibes from her. Moreover, she is always with full energy and so active that seeing her will really make you feel happy! Till the end, she had full faith on me that I will be able to deliver normally and I did it in her presence! A great doctor and above all, a great human being and so much down to earth. Having so many degrees and so much experience of handling many cases of complicated deliveries, she has no proud and is very sophisticated and patient. Would highly recommend her. Wishing to have my next pregnancy (if at all we plan) with her as well! God willing!\n\nWishing her all the best for all her future endeavours. God bless you Mam! Thankyou so much for giving us our precious gift!",

                "review_text": "Dr. Manjula Deepak, The Angel \n\nOurs is a story of ups, downs, losses, endless tears, sleepless nights,  dreams,  hopes and finally a happy beginning!\n\nI got pregnant for the first time after 3 years of marriage in 2020, which unfortunately turned out to be an ectopic pregnancy and I had to undergo an emergency salpinogectomy at Cloudnine HRBR to remove my right fallopian tube . As much as we were Thankful to God for saving us at the right time and preventing a fatality,  things went down South for us since then..... We faced a plethora of issues -   Low AMH, uncertainity of the left fallopian tube favouring a pregnancy,  doctors giving up on us and pushing us into IVF, which we even attempted and failed at, doctor giving up on me saying that \"You Would Never Be Able to Conceive Naturally\" , \"Another IVF is the only option\".  \nWe didn't have the energy to attempt another IVF and moved on and decided to give the hospital visits a break. During one of the hospital lab visits at Cloudnine HRBR, a senior nurse heard my story and recommended DR.Manjula Deepak. She said that i could just meet her once and I wouldn't even have to pay for the consultation, which amused me. I went ahead and met Manjuala ma'am, who was a person beaming with positive energy, she pushed me to believe that i will get pregnant and have my baby in my arms within a year.  A couple of months later, we saw a ray of hope when I conceived naturally. It was unbelievable to see something tiny grow inside me in the 4th week scan, which Manjula ma'am revealed. Unfortunately,  that ended up in a blighted Ovum and I was heartbroken. I remember breaking down terribly in Manjula ma'am's cabin. She stood by us and still didn't give up on me and asked me to meet Dr.Manju Nair, her very good friend at Cloudnine Fertility to help me further.\n\nI consulted Dr.Manju Nair, a very positive & energetic doctor, for a month and she helped me with the accurate timing and provided me the right kind of medicines. In a month,  I conceived naturally again.  My heart was racing when Dr.Manjula Deepak performed my first scan at 4th week.  This time it looked better than the previous time and we had our fingers crossed for the next scan.  We prayed all Gods to bless us this time at least. Majula ma'am was very confident,  but I wasn't able to pull myself up considering my previous bitter experience.  \n\nFinally the day of my first important scan arrived. My heart was racing like a train and I was just hoping that the radiologist could find a tiny heart beat inside me. I had mixed feelings as I lay in the scan room... when I suddenly heard the radiologist say \"Can you hear that? That's your baby's heart beat\".  Happiness is not just the right word to describe what I felt at that moment. \n\n Manjula ma'am's belief and God's blessings finally turned things positive for us.  We can't thank Manjula ma'am enough for the support she extended throughout the 9 months even with my GDM issue,  filing us with her contagious positive energy and pushing us through every step till the final decisive day.... We had walked in for my final consultation to discuss my birth plan when Manjula ma'am's instinct told her to perform a C- section on the very same day.  We weren't prepared mentally,  I didn't even have my hospital bag ready! and I was ready for my C-section in 5 hours. We blindly trusted Manjula Madam cos we knew that she couldn't go wrong.  We were glad that we didn't push ourselves for induced labour, considering my previous history.  On April 21st 2022, at 5.06PM , I heard my little one cry in that OT and felt her soft skin on my cheek.... tears came rolling down..it was a dream come true.. \nManjula ma'am's instinct saved us even at that moment since my baby had a loop of cord around her neck and any delay could have put us through situations we couldn't have imagined. \n\nDr. Manjula Deepak - An angel with Positive energy, zeal,  never give up attitude and belief in God. She is the reason why we never gave up.  She is the reason why I am a mother today.  As I celebrate my first mother's day,  I would like to thank Dr.Manjula Deepak from the bottom of my heart for not giving up on me and keeping up her promise of bringing my little one into the world within a year of facing a frantic downhill path. \n\nThe world needs such doctors! We love you Manjula ma'am \u2764\ufe0f  \nThank you Dr. Manjula Deepak and the amazing staff of Cloudnine HRBR for making the entire experience a smooth and memorable one \ud83d\ude0a\n",

                "review_text": "Please note that we are sharing our experience with an hope that it may help someone who would be searching for good gynecologist and with a wish that even everyone should get the same experience what we have got... Whatever I'm sharing here is purely based on our own experience, this is not to influence/impress anyone nor by someone's compulsion.I'm not sure from where to start but even till today we just can't believe ourselves that we have met a doctor who will make you feel as you are one of their dearest friend...Yes that's true... We just choosed Manjula Deepak by reading the reviews updated on Practo (We should thank the people who have updated their honest experience on Practo). We got wondered by the number of reviews updated and the ratings provided by everyone on Practo, me and my husband started thinking is this doctor really good as described by everyone here. We were regular to Malleshwaram Cloudnine branch and after we shifted to TC Palya Main road it became difficult (travelling from TC Palya to Malleshwaram everytime) to visit the gynecologist (don't want to mention the name) whom we were visiting regularly so we started searching for good gynecologist around our location, as usual we started searching through online, In between in the month of Jun-19 I had some concerns on my health and by considering the number of years of experience provided on practo doctor's profile we choosed one of the senior gynecologist with 30  years experience (again don't want to mention their name) and visited Cloudnine HRBR and it was just normal consultation and was really not happy with that consultation so again started searching for gynecologist and luckily I found Manjula Deepak's profile on Practo and found that she is available in Cloudnine HRBR branch so consulted her for first time for the same problem, as that was a very ignorable concern she also suggested the same advice as previous senior gynecologist suggested, but in my first consultation only I'm pretty much impressed by her nature, the confidence and the feeling I got on her after coming out from the consultation room was completely different. Almost for a week I discussed about Manjula Deepak with my husband by describing him about her nature, the way she spoke to me with regard to my health concern, her dressing sense, after listening to all this even my husband told me that the way you are describing her gives me a feeling that she is a doctor with different qualities so let's continue with her. Yes I should completely agree on it and sure she has blessed with unique personalities to be a doctor.The reason I was checking for gynecologist in May-19 month was to plan for our second baby and before that I wanted to get clarified on few concerns I was having on my health. Later in Oct-19 I became pregnant and off course how can I think of anyone else when Manjula ma'am is around us. Our journey went so smoothly not even a single day I had different thought in my mind, we were so relaxed and our confidence level was keep boosting post every consultation by the way she was explaining, by the way she was making us understand each and everything in detail was really phenomenal. We blessed with baby girl on 10th Jun 2020 and seriously I just can't describe how everything went smoothly and without facing any hurdle our little one entered the world.A big thanks to Doctor Manjula Deepak for making us to feel proud parents of our little one... Thank you MD ma'am... We wish all the very best to you... Triveni Hareesh",

My First kid is Special Kid ( Autistic)\n2. we planned and my wife conceived after 10 years . I meant The age gap between my two kids are 10 years\n3. My wife age is >38\n4. Gestational Diabetes was discovered during  2nd month of this pregnancy\n5. Wife having Thyroid \n\nThanks to Practo again , I have consulted Dr Manjula deepak after reading postive reviews on Practo\n\nDr Manjula is a very Honest , sincere lovable doctor. She takes care of all mothers and babies with atmost care. I  know being doctor , all doctors are very patient  in dealing their patients, however this Lady is much above than others . I am always surprised with her memory power , her activeness  and response 24*7. Her response in whats up is immediate , absolutely no exaggeration . The secret of success for Dr Manjula is PASSION. she is so passionate in her profession she even keeps her family second\nLet me cite few examples which i felt as WOW factor \n\n1. Usually when any symptom is identified  during pregnancy time, we tend to search google and gather , analyze some information before go to doctor. and we know what most of the doctors answer when we share our knowledge from google. \nI   had been in these situations and you know what Dr Manjula response in such cases... She  asks us what did Google say.. What it they suggest .. This is wonderful quality , she listens to any one and try to  understand patient anxiety and in fact agrees and suggests if that is correct\n\n2. Enormous Memory Power - DDR4 Infinite GB. She calls all her patients with Names  and   we started Visiting her since second month till C-section ( done by Dr manjula) . Any time  we meet  she always call by Name and more importantly she remembers complete history of the patient with out reading file . At least she sees 35 patients per day. This is truly appreciated , only comes with Passion on the job\n\n3.  She  likes to listen, take input from other doctors.. purely no EGOS. One such incident is we undergone many tests for this kid ( second one) as my first kid is special kid. when she was reviewing  one of the report results , she is very open to check with other doctors and accordingly suggested next steps\n\n4. She always  appreciates other doctors  and other staff. Morever she always tell better consult other doctor as i am not expert in this domain . this  she cited when we consulted for thyroid and sugar \n\n5. More importantly, she gives importance to religious customs and understand parents traditions and she  is open to listen on these grounds as well\n6. Even my mother was so impressed with the  her energy levels and she  is happy with doctor\n\nMy baby is currently 10 days old and we are enjoying parenthood\n",

                "review_text": "Manjula Deepak aka \"MD\" at hospital boards is not only a doctor! She is a friend and her friendly nature makes every pregnant ladies and their family members so comfortable with her detailed explanation on issues and happening. I had GDM which is not of so high range and not so low as well, Manjula Deepak was so generous to explain its effects/limitations and the cautions to cultivate. Doctor had committed us that \"I will try for Normal\" but not at the cost of baby or mother's health (This statement actually made us wrong perception on the scenario that GDM patients will have C-section 100% even though she did mentioned that she has done N number of NNVD's for GDM cases). The due date was on 2nd Jan 2019, Myself and my Husbands expectations was to have baby on new year with NVD + Girl baby(I know Dr. MD cannot do anything abut it). Dr. Manjula mentioned about the protocol of GDM that the delivery should happen with in 38 weeks + 6 days. We expressed our expectations on having baby on Jan, Dr. Manjula made us aware with all technical reasons for not to push it to Jan and I had to admit on 26th Night. Best part is, Dr. Manjula visited at 10:30 PM/12:00 AM/6:30 AM/10:30 AM/1:30 PM/4:00PM/ 6:30 PM and 8:30 PM. I mentioned these timings to re-iterate that the main doctor visits her patient so frequently even though having 2 duty doctors is just act of respect and HOSPITALITY. Even though my husband has done whole story on how u delivered since he was witnessing everything, Dr. Manjula didn't even left 0.1% to make NVD to me which is unbelievable for the situation I was in(GDM). She never left hope on making NVD. Key decisions made by Dr. MD :- \n1) 2 times inducing pain via Jel\n2) Dr Manjula Deepak came and examined the cirvix and good news was it was for 1 CM open and 50% clavax. after 10 hours. Any doctor would have done C section\n3) Manjula Deepak came, cirvix was at 2CM only.and was not improvee, she decided to break the water to see if baby has done pee, but there was no as such, since heartbeat of the baby was good, suffex was 50%, chaitra endurance was good but  only dilatation was 2CM. Manjula Deepak had to take a call to go for epidomal since it serves both for dilatation open for normal delivery and general anesthesia for c section. Had to go with that.\n4) Manjula Deepak came band checked the dilation, it has varied from 2 to 3 (Asked to wit for NVD) \n5) Manjula Deepak found the contraction is better and the Cirvix is at 5CM. (asked to wait)\n6) LAST BUT NOT LEAST, A motivation voice from DR. MD at last moment \"\" PUSH HARD CHAITRA, ONE HARD PUSH WILL MAKE IT\" made it possible for NVD. \n\nYes folks, Good doctors do exists and it proved for me by Dr. Manjula Deepak. (Do not think that this is paid feedback).\n",

We would like to quote few words which best explains Dr Manjula Deepak;\n\n1.\tDr Manjula is so friendly, always cheerful and have high level of energy which helped us to build the rapport on the very first meeting.\n2.\tHighly professional *** **** **** ********* ** ********** ***** ****** *********** ** ****** ****** **********\n3.\tDown to Earth, open hearted, addressed all our doubts in simple terms which helped us to build the trust. \n4.\tA very good listener and gives enough time during every consulting and ensures adequate solutions by thoroughly understanding the overall health issue and mental states.\n5.\tA complete doctor who is highly dedicated and has the ability and capacity to give extra care to every single patients \n6.\tKnowingly or unknowingly prepare the patient with high level of motivation, confidence and excitement to have a normal delivery.\n7.\tAstute timing and decision making quality naturally comes out of sheer experience.\n8.\tTaught us to experience and enjoy every single moment of the pregnancy, never loaded any fear factor during any stage.\n9.\tAlways suggest \u201cwhat is required\u201d from a medical/mental stand point, advised the significance of exercise and the importance of taking adequate rest.\n10.\tLast but not the least \u201cAvailable any time\u201d connected through phone or what\u2019s up messages at any odd time/festivals/personal celebration; showcases the dedication, empathy and love towards the profession and patient. \n\nOur experience;\n\nAfter the very first meeting with Dr Manjula we are so sure that we met the right Doctor and we are on safe hands. \n\nThrough Dr Manjula guidance we both were so equipped with good understanding about the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to follow to be on a safer side. During the fifth month my wife was little feverish and Dr Manjula helped us to overcome the fewer with less impact of antibiotic medicines. Dr Manjula never unnecessarily pushed us to do scans or other medical measures.\n\nEverything was super fine but on the 7th month my mother was unwell and was hospitalised and we all went back to hometown. The situation eventually became critical and we lost my mother after 21 days of suffering. My mother and my wife were so closed to each other and it was very difficult to go through the phase. My wife was mentally down and honestly we had no idea about what\u2019s next and entirely lost the reality about the baby. During this period Dr Manjula was in touch with us over the phone and also guided us to go for the 7th month scan and verified the report we send over what\u2019s up and guided us with the next steps. \n\nThis point in time we both were in such a confused state of mind weather to have the delivery in home town or to go back to Bangalore. After meeting a new Doctor at home town we realized where Dr Manjula stands and the value and care she gives to her patients. We decided to come back to Bangalore just because of the amount of trust and confidence we build with Dr Manjula was enormous and we need to have a safe delivery.\n\nStill remember how much care Dr Manjula shared with us after this incidence and honestly we felt huge relief because of her kind words and dedication. We followed all the advices and training tips shared by Dr Manjula. Through Dr Manjula\u2019s proper guidance we had a normal delivery and blessed with a healthy, beautiful baby girl. We both cannot express in words how much Dr Manjula helped us to sail through the entire phase. Our babies\u2019 delivery date and Dr Manjual\u2019s wedding anniversary was on the same day and I just wanted to point that Dr Manjula was available all time during the important day in her life and in fact she spend time to share some sweet memories. \n\nI strongly recommend Dr Manjula *** *** ****** **** *** *** ****************** ***** * ******\n",

This happened  at a hospital in Kolar. Since then we went through lot of struggles and fear. We were eagerly waiting to get our baby back. \nOnce my second pregnancy was confirmed, by God's grace we landed in protective hands of Dr. Manjula Deepak. With what had happened previously, we wanted a helping hand both mentally and medically to overcome the fears and have a smooth and healthy pregnancy. \nWords are not enough to describe how Dr. Manju took care of me. In our very first meeting, we she made us feel comfortable and gave us confidence. She was friendly and caring in each and every part of pregnancy. Her touch, her talks, gave me much courage to have a happy pregnancy. Her dedication towards her profession is just mind blowing. More than a doctor she was a very good friend and a guiding hand. It's just not words; every time she examined things to me she would pass on so much courage that kept me going. She ensured that every question was answered and all aspects of pregnancy was covered. She responded immediately to every message and phone call. During my labor she arrived at the hospital immediately during late night hours and stayed there till the baby was delivered, post midnight. It's was her wedding anniversary but she sacrificed her time with family to take care of me. She handled me so beautifully, more than a doctor she was like a family member, like a sister. She supported me in pain. She is such a beautiful doctor I can keep telling about her. During my labor, she was telling her colleague \"I promised her that I will give her a healthy baby\". That's the responsibility and dedication that she has towards her patients. It was a normal delivery. \nIt's amazing how she makes her every patient feel special. Even after my delivery, She ensured that the recovery was good. She is a beautiful lady in her heart and profession. I just love her.  May God bless her with all goodness and happiest life ever in all possible ways. She is a goddess of love, care, goodness, who brings life to this world.\n\nWe more than strongly recommend Dr. Manjula Deepak. \n\nWe are forever indebted to you, my dear Doctor. Thank you for getting my life back to me. \n\n- Our little prince and his happy parents Chandana, Shiva Raman and our entire family.\n\n Love you Doctor",

(I wore them up until 6th month when I started to feel back pain due to added pregnancy weight)4) She always encouraged me to take long walks and stairs if feeling comfortable.5) With one of my major worry being becoming fat postpartum, she ensured to keep a very close watch on my weight gain in 9 months and pushed me to exercise so I can deliver normally. Her efforts bore fruit when I was able to deliver a healthy baby of 3.5 kgs normally and within 2-3 weeks postpartum I reached back my pre-pregnancy weight. :) (with only little toning and firming away from my prepregnancy body)She is very quick to respond on all the queries over msgs which I feel helped me a lot in my journey with this being my first baby.During labour I wasn't very cooperative due to my low pain threshold but she was super patient with me all along and pushed me for normal delivery.She is one awesome person who will always make you feel good about yourself. Hence without a doubt she will always remain my 'go to doctor' in future as well.",

After blood test diagnosed with little hypothyroidism. Doctor advised me to take medicine for the same. I convinced her saying will wait for another one month and then we can start with medication as it was in border line madam with all positive thoughts asked me to take only supplements. \nAug - 2017 - continued to take supplements and we had intercourse as per the schedule given.\nSep - 2017 - As my periods didn't show we visited cloudnine and found that I was pregnant. :)\n. \n. visited doctor as per the dates given. \nDuring 7th month of pregnancy we decided to go to other hospital as new cloudnine hospital was not tied up with insurance company to opt for cashless for bed booking. \nBut when we informed madam about this she convinced us not worry and didn't let us go as she is the one who had treated me from pre pregnancy counselling to till then... \n. \nwith all positive thoughts given by madam I used go to office till 2 weeks before delivery. \n. \n04 May 2018-  11 pm found that water broke and I called Dr. Manjula and she asked me to visit hospital. Before I reach hospital she had called up duty doctor and informed them to start with the procedure.\n05 May 2018 - Morning she came and asked me to be cool as I was worried that Since water had broken I had deliver through C section. But at 2.30pm I delivered baby gal with Normal vaginal delivery which was like a dream come true for me.\nAs my weight was always on the lower side no body even thought that I can have NVD. But madam never demotivated me in this matter instead she always sent me home with positive thoughts.\nI had just believed Dr Manjula Deepak and ended up with fruitful outcome.\nThanks a lot madam.\nWould definitely consult you for my second pregnancy. :)\n\nRegards\nPallavi and Manohar",

We had been very low emotionally as our pregnancy where not successful. We have been consulting a renowned and much experienced consultant of cloudnine. In the first trimester due to nausea and severe vomitting got a chance to visit her as she was practicing in Cloud9 near to our place. We have to say that our first meeting was that she brings in lot of energy and sowed lot of optimism. She has spent more than 20 mins for this and shared her contact number in case of emergency or for any clarification. We have been pleased with the way we have been councelled and this remind us a snippet \n\nBefore you examine the body of a patient,\nBe patient to learn her story.\nFor once you learn her story,\nYou will also come to know her body.\n\nWe feel the rough road turned into a pleasant journey with her humane touch. Every time we visit her she does a scan for few mins  on our request and convince us that everything was normal. During our 30 week consultation I was given steroid injection for lung maturity which was scheduled next week so we can avoid travelling. After 2 days at home I got labour pain and called doctor she immediately responded and asked us to visit clinic. She examined and suggested to be ready so booked an ambulance and accompanied( which I don't think any dr will  do leaving 2 kids at home) along with and got delivered a boy and girl post mid night. She had waited till 3.00am till I was awake and convinced that both are doing good. Post which we spent a month in NICU during which she visit us frequently and discus with pedetrician on the progress and update us. We feel she is very good at \" taking right decision at right time. \nWe had a luxury of calling her anytime and discuss on our silly issues for which she replies patiently.\n\nSometime a small decision will change the life forever. Now we are more happy with our kids and got a good family friend too.\n\nThanks will be small word and we shall carry the memory for lifelong.\n\n\nCharumathy & Rajeswaran ",

These are the feelings I felt when I visited Dr.Manjula Deepak. We visited her for our pregnancy on a friend\u2019s recommendation, it was our first time. And when it\u2019s your first you are both cautious and curious, the way she addressed us was commendable.During our visits to her, she handled each checkup so lovably, showing us right exercises even when she was wearing sarees; who does that in this real world. She was focused from the starting on no extra scans, medicines and expenses. Guided us every month, for a successful delivery. The best is, she focuses on the role of what father plays during the delivery, she allowed my husband to be fully involved in my delivery. I had a normal delivery and without her patience during the labor process it was impossible. I recommend her to every friend of mine and would again visit her in future. And hey doc!! If you are reading this, thank you for making my journey memorable and happy!! More power to you!!\u2764\ufe0f",

It was her way of handling the situation and explaining the facts made us feel better. We immediately decided to continue with Manjula ma'am. She gave us confidence to try again. \nShe is friendly with everyone and has a positive vibe, which helps us to remain calm and gain more confidence.\nI had lot of other health issues throughout the pregnancy and Manjula ma'am was very caring and always reachable on whatsapp.\nEven when labour started 3 weeks earlier than due date, i did not panic because of the way Manjula ma'am spoke to me. Baby heart rate started slowing down during labour but still Manjula ma'am tried her best to continue with normal delivery. Finally baby was born in normal delivery and both mother and baby are safe. All credits to Manjula ma'am. \nWe sincerely thank Dr.Manjula Deepak from bottom of our hearts for all the care from day one. She is the best. ",

Doctor was always supportive and made any issue look simple she always poured positive thoughts and support during anguish due to which we persisted and now our dream has come true, blessed with twins. \nWe would be always grateful to Dr Manjula Deepak for the extensive support and care she provided us all over these years. Our experience with Doctor is extraordinary as she deals a complicated procedure like a walk in the park. We will vouch for Doctors skills, friendliness and care etc.,\nYou have no idea how much of a blessing you are to us. Thanks for being such an amazing doc.\nWith lots of love\nRoshan and Cherry",

We visited her exactly a year back to plan our pregnancy. She educated us well and helped us deliver our baby happy and healthy. There were several initial hiccups and complications during our journey, but she never put our morale down. She made us believe that positive things could happen if we kept our cool and that is exactly what happened. Even though she knew there could be issues, she never passed on that tension to us. She explained everything well without worrying us. She makes sure her patients are relaxed and calm, listens to all queries and addresses them in the best possible way. She is proficient in her job and her knowledge is really good. She is always ready to help you out, and is available whenever you have any questions. I would definitely recommend her to anyone who wants to visit a gynac. You can close your eyes and trust her, she will take good care of you. Thank you doctor for everything you have done for us, really means a lot !!",

She is very friendly, knows how to talk to patients and explain the health conditions. The first time we went, we had to hear a news that would have driven us very sad but the way she explained and assured that everything would be alright at the end, gave us hopes. We just followed what Mam asked us to and indeed all went well. The positive vibes she spreads inspired us and you will feel inspired even by talking to her. She is such a joy hopping around in hospital premises. Even during regular scans during pregnancy, though there were minor issues called out in scan reports, she assured us nothing to worry. During labour too, we felt very confident when we knew Mam was around. She assured we would try to go with normal delivery 95% and finally we delivered normal delivery - the great part of it, we would attribute to Mam. Can't forget the moment she raised the baby and told, it's boy. She is really an angel on earth to us. Glad we chose to consult with her.",

I have always wondered if she has more than 24 hrs in a day and from where exactly she derives so much strength that keeps her going so positively.

We planned our baby after being married for 8 years purely coz my wife was unsure on having kids. Finally when we both decided and conceived our family, friends, colleagues recommended Dr Manjula Deepak to go through this journey. During our visits to the doctor we noticed how popular and busy she was. We were apprehensive of how a doctor who is so busy would be able to attend to us and get through this journey. This was all put to rest, doc had addressed all our concerns and on the delivery date while all had given up hopes on normal delivery Doc and her team relentlessly stood by us and we had our bundle of joy. This would not have happened if it was not for Dr Manjula Deepak.Thankyou for being our guardian angel!!!",

Doctor took us on in first week of December with the due date being 22nd Dec. In the first meeting itself she spoke to us and counselled us more than 30 mins. She explained everything patiently, advised exercises, and dietary changes to help the onset of labour smoothly. Finally we elected to go in for a c section as my wife was not dilating and also had adenomyosis/ fibroid. I was allowed in the operation theatre during the procedure and could be there with my wife to speak to her and support her. it was a magic moment as I saw my daughter pulled out swiftly by the magical hands of this doctor. Doctor took extra care to look into minor aspects related to the surgery, to make sure my wife was comfortable throughout. It was a landmark day for us. Doctor is available throughout on call, whatsapp, sms etc. she will always get back to you for any concern even after delivery. overall an excellent experience with Dr Manjula.",

It was my first child so I was little nervous and worried. She always gave supportive gesture and right suggestion. I don't had any complication so recommended minimal test and scan even I wanted more scan as it was my first pregnancy and little scared about my baby. She always says, Don't worry everything is fine and if required, I will suggest scan or Test. You will always get positive vibe from her. I enjoyed my pregnancy journey because of her only. She listens your problem very calmly and explain solution in details. Sometime she tells in advance, you might be experiencing these problem what I wanted to discuss with her. She emphasized for normal delivery from my first visit even I was not sure about , will deliver normally. I had normal delivery because of her supported and encouragement. Throughout my pregnancy I found her as a friend more then a doctor, she always reachable on WhatsApp or call whenever I needed her. Thank you doctor for your support.",

Right from our first appointment, her friendly response, advices, treatment made us feel so homely and comfortable that I couldn't thank god enough for helping us find her.  \nThroughout my pregnancy, Dr.Manjula consistently guided me towards a healthy and traditional delivery where I followed all her suggestions by keeping myself physically active which only helped me towards a healthy baby. It was until my 9th month scan where I was worried after knowing that my baby is in breech position and it could be a C section if the baby doesn't turn down. I was disheartened knowing that. Dr.Manjula boosted my confidence to such a level where I happily accepted her decision, I trusted my doctor from the beginning and it was obvious that I put my trust on her and faith in god. The Ceserean surgery was done so smooth that I was able to walk and do my chores in just a week. Overall, my experience with Dr.Manjula deepak was fabulous. The moment we would see her with a smile, all our worries would vanish. :) \nThank you so much Dr.Manjula mam!!",

She put me at ease, answered my questions (believe me, I had many and at every appointment) and in tough times, she gave me a hope and a prayer. She let me know the procedures before hand and explained it in detail, be it as minute as a need for an injection. Personally, she prefers her patients to undergo a vaginal delivery if possible but when it was decided as a c-section for me, she supported me and made sure I did not fall into a guilt trip! ( Well, cos I was mentally preparing for a vaginal delivery for 9 months!). I'll never forget her saying that she doesn't want me to have a traumatic birthing experience (no one ever told me that birthing could be an experience otherwise). And so it was, not a pain free but a trauma free experience! Amidst her daily count of dozens of patients, she remembered a tiniest detail about my condition and ensured to tell the on duty doctor prior to my surgery and made sure that I do not undergo any stress cos of that. You would see her enter the hospital with an aura that will just awe you. I have seen her at the hospital at odd hours attending to patients, spending overnight after a procedure and finally meeting lots of other patients the next day with the same zest. Sometimes I wonder if she gets a break or vacation ever. \nSo yeah I did finally find a trustworthy, my go-to obgyn afterall!",

I had consulted couple of doctors before consulting Manjula doctor, no one is as friendly as her and best thing is she always encourages you for normal delivery. I had bleeding during my second month of pregnancy, however doctor saved our baby and in all our upcoming visits, she was always giving us positive vibes. Whenever we met doctor, we used to get that positivity. During my third trimester I was worried about baby's weight, but doctor guided us so well and explained the diet to improve baby's weight. Whenever there is emergency,\u00a0 she is just one call/text away. Never seen any doctor who is so dedicated and energetic like her. She ensures minimal visits/check-ups to the hospital. I still can't believe that sensitive person like me, who can't tolerate pain, underwent normal delivery \ud83d\ude04 and we are blessed with baby girl \ud83d\ude0d It is all because of Dr. Manjula Deepak. We can't thank her through words, she is definitely an angel \ud83d\ude4f ",

She explained things well , she was very open to questions / doubts  and She was extremely friendly and this made me very comfortable. One thing that I have personally observed on many occasions is that she will not prescribe unnecessary medications , I have personally seen her avoid or prescribe a lower dose . \nShe also has an excellent memory, she would almost remember everything I discussed to her in my previous visit and would follow up on that in the next visit . It was reassuring to me that she understood things around me and wasn\u2019t just looking at reports . \n\nI safely delivered my boys via c section . She was so swift at the procedure and kept me comfortable in the OT .  All my family members too were very impressed with her work. \n\nI would highly recommend Dr Manjula Deepak.I am very happy that I consulted her. \n\n",

The doctor i had been visiting suggested immediate operation and keep the baby in incubator around 27th week of pregnancy. At that crucial time, i came to know about Dr.Manjula Deepak mam through my friend Satya Pany.  I explained the situation to Dr.Manjula Deepak mam , she understood our critical situation and was kind enough to re-evaluate the condition. With her assurance and kind words, i was confident that my wife would be in right hands for her pregnancy.  she had been in the cloudnine hospital (Horamavu, bangalore) until her 39th week and gave birth to  a baby boy through normal delivery.\nWe thank Dr.Manjula Deepak  from the bottom of our heart. She is thorough professional **** ******** ********* and explained everything related to pregnancy in a lay man's term. Without her, it wouldn't have been a smooth journey.  She is very down to earth, understands human values.Before taking any crucial decision on high risk pregnancy cases, i would always recommend to consult with Dr.Manjula Deepak  mam.\nShe is our GOD, blindly everyone can believe her. Once again Thanks a lot on behalf of my entire family. Good Luck Mam.",

I had a very horrible experience on my first pregnancy with some other gynecologist, this forced me to switch to Dr.Manjula. The whole journey of my second pregnancy from day 1 to delivery, & post delivery consultation with Dr.Manjula has been memorable. I really loved the way she calmly convinced me on all the week points in my first pregnancy. She promised me for a healthy baby with full term, & kept on her promise. She has been very professional, meanwhile friendly in nature to explain all the neonatal parameters throughout my pregnancy. Even during delivery she was very supportive. Now that we miss the way she used to call me \" bare rani, neenu good girl agidiya\", on every visit with little improvement in my health parameters. She even replies for our text messages at time, be it late nights. All that we have to speak about her is, she's the most recommendable gynecologist that I have ever seen. Never miss an opportunity to consult her. We love you Dr.Manjula. stay blessed.",

I still remember the first day when I met her in cloud nine HRBR branch. She was full of energy and welcomed me with a big smile. Since this was my first pregnancy I was very scared but after speaking to her I felt like I am in right hand.. Then continues the pregnancy journey: I had Asthama,Allergy rhinitis, Migraine and Slip disk towards the end of 2nd trimester. It was Manjula mam who was always there as a guidance, mentor, friend who cared so much. She used to personally call and check in the lab about the reports . She is gem of a person.\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\n\nI was very scared about my delivery process as I wasn't able to walk due to slip disk from the end of my second trimester . I had to use wheelchair while travelling but she was always on my side during the whole pregnancy journey. Before the delivery date I was very scared and was messaging her at night 2 am but she replied and asked me to calm down ..\n\nIt is only because of her I was able to deliver my baby boy .. If anyone of you are in search of a good OBGN/Gynecologist then there can be noone good other than Manjula mam .. You will be in safest hands ..\n\nThank you Manjula mam for being so nice and caring to us \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a.. ",

But to just try my options I was suggested Dr. Manjula Deepak, and meeting her was enough to change my mind. \nEven though we were meeting her for the first time, she made us feel so comfortable. The casual and super friendly manner of hers can put us at ease immediately. She never forgets who we are even if v meet her after 2 months! \nWhen it comes to treatment she is very clear and transparent. She tries her best for normal ( I had normal though my chances of cesarean was little high). Every medication or scan prescribed by her is only on a need on basis and not unnecessary.Her positivity radiates so much that even while in labour just her presence gives us so much confidence and keeps us calm.  Her dedication and the connection she builds with the patient and their family is what makes her the best!! She not only supports the mother in labour but also the father who is usually overlooked. \nShe is a wonderful being with so much energy and enthusiasm. My gratitude for her cannot be put in words. \n\n",

Please don't change this.In a way your approach towards your patients make them feel better sometimes without even using medicine. Two doctors can read a same book and do the same practical but decision making is something which makes one better from another. My wife just completed 28 weeks of her gestational period and was suffering from severe pre eclampsia. She reached to 8.2 for euric acid and 3  for urine albumin. With those numbers she could have had multiple organ failure at any time. But you made a decision to get the delivery done and saved both the mother and the baby. The baby was only 840 gm. I felt it was a co incidence when I changed from a top notch gynecologist  on 4th month of her pregnancy for some reason(no offense, some doctors are not for everyone) to another top one (Manjula) \ud83d\ude00. Now I know why that reason happened, god wanted us to meet you and put our lives at a safer hand. Words/gifts/fees nothing is enough for us to repay what you have given us. We will owe you for life and will keep on praying for your good health and long life. On our way back to home we were feeling sad that we won't get to meet you often now. God bless you \ud83d\ude4f.

I would like to put a glimpse of our journey with you. As a matter of fact Dr. Manjula have always given a lot of thought in directed us to right path on this new phase of our parental life. Dr. Manjula have always been so kind to the patient who was under her care. It is well established fact that Dr. Manjula is a prowess in the field of  Gynecology.  In the vicinity we less merely see such kind of doctors like Dr. Manjula. Whenever we visit Dr. Manjula it was always happy to see as she expounding about the prevailing situation meticulously. After my wife was with child nothing toppled us mentally because they aid to mitigate and to stem the patients fear pertaining to the pregnancy. Never we encountered any tribulations during our consultation even though they have patients in droves.   Even on the aggrandized situation their care towards the patient was laudable and was not diminished. The staff and medical team was successful in providing high standard of services. Your commitment towards patient care is impressive and highly commendable. \n\n \n\nI would like to compliment her and her team for the excellent service we received and also like to extend my gratitude and penchant for the service they lended to us. \n\n \n\nMany thanks, \n\n \n\nMr. Kiran Kumar K and Mrs.Salomi \n\n ",

Since the first delivery was normal, after examining me and the fetal position, she gave us the confidence that the second delivery will also be a normal one. She has advised me to do specific exercises and to follow the prescribed diet.\n\nI and my husband are very much happy about the way Dr.Manjula has interacted with us. She is very friendly, confident, and explains the procedures very well. She made us feel confident and prepared us to take our minds off all the worries.\n\nWe rushed to the hospital due to labor pain and water breakdown at 12:30 am midnight and only the duty doctor was there at that time. But, by 3 am when I was in the labor room Dr. Manjula had reached there to take care of my delivery. I was very happy and relieved with the presence of Dr. Manjula there at the time of delivery. Dr. Manjula supported me throughout the process of NVD.\n\nDr. Manjula is an amazing and extraordinary doctor. Above all she is a dynamic, friendly, and energetic human being.  Me and my family would like to thank her from the bottom of our hearts for all her support. \n\nI highly recommend Dr. Manjula for everything related to Obstetrics & Gynaecology.\n",

As this is our first baby and me and my husband was alone in Bangalore, so every time when we need any help she helped us. She is always available in whatsapp.In 3rd month of pregnancy suddenly one day I got too much stomach pain. I was so scared and went to hospital. Manjula mam done checkup and told that baby is fine and the pain was for gastric. She gave medicines and after that I got relief. After seven month of pregnancy I had low amniotic fluid level but under her treatment the fluid level increased and able to avoid the pre mature delivery. She told she will try for normal delivery and I was waiting for the labour pain. But suddenly one day morning my BP was very high and I went to meet mam. That time only she advised to admit me into hospital and done c section and delivered baby safely. I am very thankful to her.Thank you mam for all the help and support in this pregnancy journey..\ud83d\ude42",

If not for Dr.Manjula my pregnancy would not have been possible.Dr.Manjula is that burst of positive energy in the hospital that can turn any worrying moment into a happy one. I visited doc when I was having a miscarriage. I had come to her for second opinion. She made me very comfortable, eased my mind, helped me get through the depression of losing my baby. She tried her best to save my pregnancy but it was too late. After this painful episode doc made sure I didn't lose hope and not be depressed and helped me keep myself fit physically and mentally so I could conceive again soon.Within 2 months I convinced my rainbow baby. Next nine months under doc's consultation went pretty great. Though I had thyroid, GDM and am very obese, with her advice I never faced any problem. My visits to hospital were the happiest times as she would always put positive thoughts in my mind and cleared even my silliest doubts. Doc was always very approachable in person and also on call for any sort of emergency. Her taking personal interest in my scans and tests made everything easy. My delivery also went pretty smooth and I was blessed with a baby boy. Thank you so much doc for making this happen. You Are The Best... #sorryforthelatepost :) ",

I do not have words to describe my happiness and joy in particular my daughter and she is verymuch happy after seeing his little brother. She was very much helpful through out the duration starting from 1st month of pregnancy to till delivery. We use to afriad and call her even for small issues. But she always attends the call whether it is day or night and provide guidance and medication. She has always encouraged us to have less medication and more control over food and activities to perform daily. She is very friendly in nature and explains everything in detail to the patient as well as husband. We feel very good and openly discuss all sorts of problems with her. She gives her 100% to go with normal delivery and will not opt for C-Sec untill unless it is required. She did tried for normal delivery but had to go for C-Sec in my case due to some complications and she did clearly explained about the complications and clarified all our doubts. We are very much thankful to her for the support provided to us. Our little prince want to thanks Dr Manjula Deepak for bringing him safely into this world and a very big thanks from my us and my daughter aswell.",

She always had a good instinct. She was able to tell just by touching that I was carrying twins. Initially i was not ready, but Dr.Manjula adviced and motivated me and it made me more confident in carrying my babies. She motivated me during each visit which made me mentally strong and helped me to carry my babies till 37 weeks.\nBy God's grace and Dr.Manjula's help, I delivered a boy and a girl baby. The diet suggested by her helped me in delivering my babies with good weight. Dr.Manjula prepared me mentally and physically for c-section, As both of my babies were in breech position.\n\nThe best part in her is the way she understands her patients. Even though, I was carrying twins she did not ask me to take advanced treatment or medicines or unecessary tests. The positive response from her, makes me even more stronger. I am so much thankful for the care and time she rendered to me and quick response  from her whenever I disturb her by call or messages. She is so energetic and enthusiastic easily approachable person who spread positivity among us. I feel so lucky that I got a wonderful doctor who always makes me comfortable. Myself and my whole family wholeheartedly thank Dr.Manjula for her support  and will  be in touch with this wonderful person. Continue this good work!\n\nRegards,\nArockia swetha and Amal.",

But the way the Doctor treated me was so homely that I could never feel that I am visiting a Doctor for an ailment. This was one of the reasons things went on smoothly. Also as I was nearing delivery period we could clearly make out we are in the right hands. Every time I used to talk to the Doctor at any time(day or night) ** *** **** * ****** *** *********** ********** for this there seems to be no words to express our thankfulness. Finally, the delivery time was also a crucial decision as there were several complications due to being diabetic which required a timely action which was handled really well by our Doctor.

I met Dr. Manjula during my first pregnancy at the age of 31 and soon realised that I am in safe hands. Initially, before going to consult her, we used to prepare our queries to ask. But when we actually met her she used to explain everything that was in our minds without being asked! This made us feel so relaxed and cared that we would forget all worries. I fell sick few times during pregnancy and called her at odd times, but she always listened to our problems patiently before giving an exact solution. Because of the confidence she had given us we could enjoy a worry free pregnancy and prepare mentally and physically for the D-Day. Manjula ma'am was so precise about the delivery date that my water broke on the 2nd day of 40th week, just as she predicted. I called her at 4.30am in the morning, no surprises! she picked the call and guided us to get admitted in the hospital. When the labor really started and I could hold her hand, it felt like I was with my mother, fully assured and cared. My princess was blessed to have taken birth in her expert hands, it was a NORMAL DELIVERY!! We couldn't have asked for more.\n\nYou are the most active, stylish & sweet person we have ever met and we would like to take this opportunity to thank you ma'am for everything from the bottom of our hearts, may God bless you & your family.",

After our 1st meeting with her, it was no looking back and no more doctor hunts, she was just perfect in every sense. Infact she explained the problem and gave us the confident that we can save our Precious baby with advanced Medical technology.\n\n Doctor did not take any chance she was completely vigilant about our baby growth and took all the measures to save our Precious Baby. \nShe is pleasing, very friendly (I believe that\u2019s the quality every doctor should poses) and really good at what she does. \n\nWe had plenty of queries/thoughts running in our mind but after meeting her, our mind would be free and this would bring smile and satisfaction.\nToday we are blessed with baby Boy and we are very happy. She stayed throughout the pregnancy as a friend to my wife. Thank you mam for all your support.\n\nWith whole hearted we thank you once again, for giving us such a wonderful feeling that now we are a proud parents to our Baby Boy.\nI strongly recommend Manjula Deepak.",

As usual couples, we scouted  for the best doctor for my first pregnancy and we came across Manjula Deepak from Cloudnine. We struck the chord almost immediately on our first meeting, I found a friend in her,a friend who was available at any hour to comfort me. My first pregnancy went in normal, except for the fact that my child has passed motion in the uterus just as I got my labour pain. Dr Manjula suggested that we go in for a cesarean as the child would injest the motion and would lead to complications later. We went with her advice and gave birth to a healthy Princess. Same went as on for our second child. My first child was barely 6 months and I had become pregnant again,we were confused and wanted to terminate and had visited Manjula for advice as the first was a cesarean, she comforted us and told I could continue my pregnancy if I wanted to and that I would have no issue giving birth to the second. heartfelt thanks to her, I gave birth to a baby boy. We are a complete family now, all just because we had Dr Manjula Deepak by our side. This is for all new, going to be parents. You don't need a doctor, you need to find a friend in a doctor  and she's the one. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MANJULA...! WE LOVE YOU LOADS & FRIEND'S FOR A LIFETIME...!",

She treated us like her own family member with so much of care and love. She tries to be always available for any issues on WhatsApp for her patients. She also ensures minimal visits/check-ups to the hospital. Best part of the Mam is even you are in stress, she treated you very calmly and happily. \n          During the entire pregnancy, she is much focussed on natural way of making process healthy and smooth by suggesting exercise, walking, healthy diet, and be active etc. I followed her instruction and started walking 30 min morning & evening and some exercise. During her supervision I have Normal Delivery (Rare now a days) and blessed with baby girl even baby weight was 3.5Kg. \n         In the face of human, she is real God for me. Thank you very much Mam for your care and love from pregnancy till now. We are really blessed to have doctors like you who treats patient with so much love care and satisfaction.\n",

We heard lots of positive reviews from internet and in our first meet itself we believed why she has such good fan base all-over. With the time to time guidelines she has given for normal delivery, at 8th month my wife put them aside and ate lots of sweets brought by her mother, the baby has put on 2kg of weight already and the delivery has become complex. The labor went on for long hours and at one point of time my wife has givenup and asking for either to give epidural or do cesarean but Dr.Manjula Deepak has brilliantly handled the situation and did the noramal delivery with baby boy having 3.4kg. We were so blessed to do the normal delivery under the supervision of Dr.Manjula Deepak and always grateful to her. The best part is the way she remember her patients is amazing. When I complained about my mother-in-law for putting lots of sweets in 8th month, Dr.Manjula remembered that questioned (in a funny way) my mother-in-law after the delivery, such a long-lasting memory she has. Overall we had an amazing experience with her and I strongly recommend to consult her if you are looking for normal delivery.",

This is our second time seeing Dr. Manjula Deepak, and we have already decided that for our second baby, we will again see Dr. Manjula Deepak only because the first-time experience was fantastic and everything went smoothly, and the second time also went as expected seamlessly.\n\nI'd like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our doctor, Manjula Deepak. She is such an amazing person with a lot of energy who spreads positive vibes for the patients and their families even in the most difficult situations. When you go to the hospital in any condition, you will return without fear and with a smile on your face \ud83d\ude0a, and this happens because of the way Dr. handles the counselling.\n\nThank you to all the sisters who helped us with a smile before, during, and after delivery, as well as whenever we needed assistance handling the baby for nighttime breastfeeding. In light of the Covid situation, the management implemented strict rules restricting people from entering the building in order to ensure everyone's safety, which I applaud.\n\nOverall, we had a great experience with Dr. Manjula Deepak and at Cloud Nine hospital. And I would recommend without hesitation to any new mommy to see Dr. Manjula Deepak, and any tensions, issues, or questions you have will be relieved by Dr. Manjula madam.\n\n",

I picked her from the myriad of Ob-gyns available in Bangalore solely on the basis of practo reviews and it has done justice. \nDr Manjula really does keep the best interest of the patient in mind while recommending a solution or a course of treatment. \nHer demeanour is always positive and she does to a large extent respects the wishes of her patients. \nOne of the most outstanding points that I appreciate her for is the fact that she believes in the concept of a healthy pregnancy by insisting on the practise of self control when it comes to food so weight gain stays in the healthy range and at the same time suggesting  appropriate exercises to aid that goal. This helped me have the pregnancy and delivery I had aimed for. \nThe only downside to my experience was that the waiting time to see the doctor was too much every time, this was especially hard during covid peak months where one would not want to remove masks to eat and drink freely. \n\n",

I feel she is the another avtar of goddess and helped us deliver our little bundle of joy.  It's rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. She handled my queries so nicely and helped me overcome all my fears. She was available 24*7 for all the queries and doubts. we could not call our families due to pandemic but she always took care of my anxiety and questions like a elder sister. I really adore her for every personal touch she puts in for handling her patients. I had pregnancy without any complications, all because of her advices and diet plan. She always encourages to follow natural methods which i really love about her. I had cervical length of 28 mm in 5th month, but she assured that there is no need of cervical stiches and again asked us to do scan and indeed she was right as it came out to be 33 mm in consecutive scan. we cant thank her enough for helping us getting our biggest blessing of lifeI am writing this review on International women's day as she is one of the most amazing doctor and woman I know.Ankita & Rohan",

I had googled a lot before choosing a doctor for my pregnancy. After a thorough search, I decided to visit Manjula ma'am. In the very first visit I loved her friendliness. I never felt she was new to me.\nShe is very enthusiastic and loves her profession. She doesn't recommend unnecessary medication. She makes sure we have a good diet and follow proper exercise routine. She herself teaches exercises and also makes us try it out in front of her.\nDuring my delivery , since I couldn't bear the pain i asked for a C section. But Manjula ma'am was so much particular as C was not needed in my case. She was 100% sure that she could do a Normal delivery. She explained me and my husband and requested to trust her and give her a chance. even though i was not happy at that moment, when I turn back and see , we are extremely grateful for her decision.\nAnyone who is in search of an Obstetrician, dont even think twice. You would be in right hands with Dr. Manjula Deepak!!!",

Despite trying and consulting a number of doctors, we were not able to conceive for over 5 years of marriage, and this was taking a toll on us. Meeting Dr. Manjula gave us the confidence and courage to not give up. She gave us the clarity we needed without alarming us or giving us false hope. Dr. Manjula was not only honest and respectful with the diagnosis, but also made our journey enjoyable rather than an ordeal. We could reach out to her at any time during the day as she was just one message away. With Dr. Manjula\u2019s guidance, I was able to conceive on the second visit and deliver a healthy baby girl on November 2021. She gave me the courage and pushed me to have a vaginal childbirth. Moreover, Dr. Manjula gave me guidance on diet and exercise in addition to the necessary medical advice I needed. She was attentive to my concerns and reasoned them out, making it a stress-free pregnancy for me.\u00a0\nVisits to the hospital were something that my husband and I were always eager about, all thanks to Dr. Manjula\u2019s infectious energy! Her energetic personality, along with her skills, made this journey a memorable one. I\u2019d recommend Dr. Manjula any day because she is the best out there!\u00a0\nP.S: The labour room story is something I will joke about with my daughter. Thank you, doc for being patient with this patient (pun intended)!",

I started visiting when I was  in my 5th month and my experience was never turned into disappointment.Everytime I visited her she encouraged me (sometimes scolding but in polite) for normal delivery. She always motivated me and full with positive vibes. The way she prescribed things for example diet follow, exercises - all i followed and had delivered normal without any epidural. Coming to the day when i got into labor and i was admitted in evening. I was bit tensed as it was my first pregnancy and most of people delivered through c-section around me. But Dr. came and consoled me that everything can be done within an hour or so and we were blessed with baby boy.Dr. Manjula is so dedicated into her profession that she came to see me everyday even if she has 1min of time. I am thankful to Dr. Manjula that she kept me confident till delivery and encouraged me a lot. I am very delighted today and feel that we(me and baby) were in safe hands throughout the journey. Last but not the least 'a big Thank you and big hug' to Dr. Manjula from a patient's side.",

My wife was advised by our previous doctor to terminate pregnancy due to multiple fibroids and thereafter to go for laparoscopic myomectomy to remove fibroids.  After termination of pregnancy, my wife continued bleeding for three months. We were scared and confused as the bleeding was not stopping. Then my colleague recommended me to visit Dr. Manjula Deepak.  Me and my wife was very much impressed with her confidence and explanations at the very first meeting. She gave medicine for the bleeding to stop and waited for the normal menstrual cycle to return before planning for surgery. She advised for open myomectomy as the fibroids were big in size and suggested us to plan for pregnancy after two months of surgery. The journey of pregnancy won\u2019t be that seamless without her guidance and support. Finally, my wife had caesarian delivery and we were blessed with a baby boy. Dr Manjula Deepak is an amazing person, and I haven\u2019t met such a down to earth doctor in my life. I can blindly recommend Dr. Manjula Deepak to any couple who are planning to have child. Thanks, doctor for all the support. \nFrom Sandipta and Durba",

She is present, focussed, reassuring and talented. \nI never felt rushed. She always listens to you and your concerns or issues. She does make you feel like you are her only concern, takes all the time needed, treats you as an individual and not just a gynaecological problem\nIt is not often that I look forward to visiting a hospital; but in this case I really did. My husband always used to tell - we may be going there in a tensed mood at times , but we always leave her room with a smiling face. My appointments were all positive experiences. She always provided clear and uncomplicated advice and guidance. She was always available on whatsapp to clear any doubts even if they sound silly.\nShe genuinely cares for her patients. You could not find a better or a kinder gynaecologist",

We were totally taken by her positive attitude, friendliness and jovial nature. As my pregnancy was through IVF and I was sceptical about changing the doctor at 20 weeks, Dr made me feel very confident and advised to proceed as a natural pregnancy as I did not have any complications. I was active all through my pregnancy and doctor was always available on phone for any concerns and queries.\n\nComing to my delivery, my water broke at 36 weeks and rushed to the hospital. Doctor induced me with pain and continuously monitored for progress. As I had some bleeding, doctor decided to go for C-section. But after getting into the OT, I was 8cm dilated and doctor quickly suggested we go for normal delivery within 30 minutes also the baby heartbeat was good. We trusted her decision and proceeded, Within few pushes I delivered a baby boy. We immensely appreciate the doctor\u2019s timely decision and confidence in opting for normal delivery at that moment. \n\nWe are forever grateful to you and our first pregnancy experience was all the more special because of you. Thanks a lot doctor.\n\nHighly recommend Dr Manjula Deepak for pregnancy care and management. *** ** *** **** ** *** ***** ** *********** *** you can put all your trust in her.",

She was a great experience from the moment we walked into our first visit with her, to the way we were greeted, to my amazing treatment/ consultation. Her friendly behavior made our pregnancy journey so much more easier. \nShe has always figured out what was wrong without ordering tons of tests and wasting time. Very thorough with her exams. Very direct and specific with her medical or delivery plan. With her help and support we are blessed with a beautiful baby girl through normal delivery, though I had few complications she always treated us with every little detail possible and we were always getting positivity and encouragement from her. \n\nNow I can honestly say that i had an amazing pregnancy journey because of her. We\u2019ll always be thankful to her for her support and kindness throughout the journey. She is the best thing happened with us after we got pregnant. If you are in Bangalore and looking for someone to trust on your pregnancy journey then Dr Manjula Deepak is the one.\nShe will be a very important part of our lives that we will never forget.",

From 8th my BP was raising and not under control. Manjula mam daily asked to message her my BP readings and closely monitored my condition. She tried to deliver on my 37th week but on my 35th week I was feeling blur vision. I have informed my condition and she asked to visit hospital immediately. She monitored my BP and taken timely decision to deliver. I am blessed with baby girl and baby is also all good not shifted to NICU. Post delivery also daily she visited twice and saw my condition and regularly talking to duty doctors on treatment to be given. I haven't seen such a kind and down to earth doctor in this corporate world. Our entire family is thankful to Manjula mam for the care she has taken throughout my pregnancy. She cares her patients with lot of care. It's her passion. If we see her will get to know how much she loves her profession. I recommend Manjula mam. ",

I had two miscarriages and almost lost hope before I looked up Google for a good gynae to trust, and I thank all my stars for finding Dr Manjula. Right from day one of my consultation I knew that this time it would be fine, she took all the time to console me and explain my husband and me that with just a few precautions everything would be fine.Within my second month of consulting her I got pregnant naturally. Still, I was very apprehensive due to my history, she understood me very well and showed me my baby through FHR as many times it required to keep me calm. I contracted covid too, during my pregnancy, and it did lead to some serious complications, but Dr got me out of it.... I cannot say i had an amazing pregnancy, but i can definitely say - I did have someone I could blindly trust and go to, every single time I faced any issue, its a very very huge deal to have a Dr like that. Thanks a zillion for everything Dr. ",

We had heard from our friends that many gynaecs are rude and have no empathy. But Manjula doctor was the exact opposite. She was very very friendly and used to make us feel at ease from the very first visit. She emphasised a lot on healthy diet and exercises to help with vaginal delivery. She used to preempt all our questions by explaining everything at the beginning of every consultation. She helped to have a smooth pregnancy throughout. We had to go for  C section since baby heartbeat was reducing but Manjula doctor was very reassuring and supportive. I will never forget the moment she said \" It's a beautiful baby boy, Vidya. Good girl\". I recommend her 100 pc to everyone especially first time mothers who are generally clueless about everything. Thank you doctor for all your help! ",

And to this date, I can happily and with great confidence, say this much that, we have never regretted our decision of having chosen her as our obstetrician. She provides motherly care and friendly support, all the time, every time. Her instant responses to our enormous queries on whatsapp was an immense support system to sail us thru the 40 weeks that indeed didn't seem so long because she had our back all these times. A very confident medical practitioner, very open and transparent in her thoughts and advise, very loving and caring towards her patients and attenders, very passionate towards her work, never seems stressful on the outside even though she works all days (on calming down her patients, resolving queries offline) even when she is on her day off. All this is usually rare to see from a medical professional, but I am glad she has chosen to serve the community this way and to touch so many lives on a such a positive note. Our wishes and prayers for her's and for for her family's well being always. ",

But, if not for an exceptional doctor and a far more exemplary human like Dr. Manjula Deepak, I wouldn\u2019t have come out as strong a believer as I do today. She fills one with hope, faith and a renewed strength when we seem to be losing it all. The energy, time and warmth that she exudes, at each visit like you are her only appointment, despite having tended to numerous patients and deliveries is something that requires her sort of passion and devotion to a profession which she almost worships. I am just one among her many fortunate patients who cannot thank her enough for seeing them through when things got edgy and re instilling a stronger faith in the Divine and invariably, an immense respect for her. I end with a prayer that, she continues to touch countless lives with the same hope, faith and strength which sails me through today.We are forever indebted and grateful \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffcSadia & Imtiaz Ali",

Though there were other hospitals nearby we chose to visit Dr.Manjula which was 35km away from where we stay. After meeting her for the first time I wouldn't want to consult anyone else other than her. And that was the best decision we made. She made me feel comfortable and confident and my entire pregnancy was a cakewalk for me. She cleared all our doubts and concerns and explains everything in detail. *** ***** ********** *********** ********* ** ***** *** would respond on WhatsApp or call for any queries or follow-up reports. Dr.Manjula is an amazing doctor, super cool and friendly with a positive attitude. I highly recommend Dr.Manjula for the way she guides her patient throughout the journey. Thank you doctor for making my pregnancy, labor, and delivery so beautiful and memorable. If anyone looking for a professional yet friendly gynecologist then she is the one!",

She is full of energy and is very passionate about her profession which is quite evident when you see her. On the first consultation itself she shared her phone number where we could get our queries answered. ( which is rare these days).\nFor every query, she promptly responded and I did not have to run to the hospital for a consultation. She also made sure that I avoid multiple trips to the hospital in  covid times.\n\nIn my 9th month, when the baby had not descended, she asked me to get a scan to check if everything was alright. As she rightly suspected , baby had not one but three chords around the neck. The radiologist mentioned to me that usually doctors prefer a c-section in such cases which worried me as I was very keen on a normal delivery. But Dr Manjula calmed us down and explained the situation to us in detail. She also assured us that she will try her best to make sure its a normal delivery and only if there is an emergency she will go for a c-section.\n\nOn the day of induction, she made sure the staff was briefed and made sure the whole process was monitored meticulously. Finally with her efforts and the supportive staff, my baby was delivered normally.\n\nThank you doctor for making my pregnancy a pleasant and a happy one!",

As it didn't increase even after 2 days, we had to  do a C section and take the baby out on time . As the bay was full term  in 37.5 weeks there were no complications. Thank you Dr. Manjula Deepak . The baby is doing well now . We followed up with her from the very beging of the pregnancy and we are very glad that we consulted her. She was ready to handle any extreme emergency situation . She even spoke to near by hospitals to get icu bed and oxygen as back up to handle emergency, luckily nothing happened. Just wanted to mention that she was ready to face emergencies. \nI strongly recommend you to visit her if you are planning for a baby or already pregnant and wants to check up regularly and  plan birthing. \n- Abhinesh ( Father of a proud baby girl ) ",

We had visited the hospital without checking or knowing any specific gynecologist for further consultation. We were consulting some other doctor for around 2 consultation. We were not satisfied after every consultation at the same time we noticed Dr. Manjula Deepak in hospital the way she used to interact with her patients also with her colleagues which made me really happy. One fine day we decided to change our doctor and opted Dr. Manjula Deepak who is energetic and really supportive as a family member in our whole pregnancy period.As it was only me and my husband handling the whole pregnancy(9 months labour delivery) it was easy because of her who was promising for normal delivery and motivating us for all the worries by being available 24/7( call and whatsapp as well). Choosing you was a perfect decision made by us as you never gave up your promise of normal delivery.I suggest Dr. Manjula Deepak to all my friends and family members as she is the best friendly doctor to contact who gives dedicated time for individual patient as a family member.And also my husband has told you if we ever plan for second baby we would only prefer you as our doctor. \ud83d\ude0dThank you soo much \ud83d\ude0d for your love and dedication.Thankyou once again from Prajna and Ravi Nayak and also loads of love from our little champ \u2764\u2764",

So I'll just try not to repeat all good things about her (all r true)but mention how she helped me in my pregnancy journey. I was one of those who has always been super scared of pregnancy and delivery but Dr. Manjula's empathatic, generous and friendly nature helped me go thru my journey. There were lot of hicupps in the beginning and the end like severe gastritis, nausea thruout, wt. Loss, IC, low HB etc. (Was even admitted once)but the way she handled my case with patience and extra attention was really v appreciative. She always listened to our worries, gave all the details about the condition, responded timely on watsapp/call in the hour of need and even spoke to my FIL to give some reassurances. In the end due to some complications we had to go for a c section, which I was abs fine with, and my delivery was smooth, both I and baby were abs fine.. Thanks Dr. Manjula for all your support :)",

Luckily she was the Dr available in that midnight. I was so Nervous and tensed. However She kept me positive & treated the situation with utmost care and with a smiling face. Luckily our baby was fine..It was god who sent us to her. We are fortunate to come across her for pregnancy check-up/ scans.  *** ** *** **** *** * *** **** ***** She is the perfect example to be a Dr. With positive, friendly & encouraging attitude that gave me strength entire my pregnancy period & felt everything is normal everytime I visited her. The best thing about her is how she focuses on Natural birth. She also goes in for minimal medication & testing & belives that a natural process like pregnancy need no intervention unless really required.  Finally we won the battle , got our baby girl delivered by her in such a positive way that I am really really grateful to her. She is goddess for us. Thank you Doctor.

And when I got pregnant and met her for the first time I was happy with the way she spoke and her friendly attitude. Since this was my first pregnancy, I had many questions and doubts to ask. Dr.Manjula was very proactive in telling me what kind of body changes can I expect and that kept me well prepared on what to eat what not to eat. How to keep myself active and what are the exercises I need to do. Anytime I text her or call her on any doubts or concern I would get a reply immediately from her. She was the one who made sure I am in safe hands and I would have a safe delivery. To have a happy and peaceful pregnancy I think a good gyno is very important and Dr Manjula is best. She never asked me to take unwanted scans or make me visit the hospital unnecessarily which was most helpful in this pandemic time. Finally I had normal delivery where I, my husband and my family were a little worried since i was over weight but she patiently waited and I had a safe and normal delivery. She takes the right decision at the right time and I am amazed with the way how she is available all the time either at the hospital or on phone. so if your looking for gyno please dont have a second thought. please meet Dr Manjula.\n\nReenu Vinod",

The moment i met Dr , I confirmed my husband that this is it , i want my delivery to be done by her. The friendliest dr i have ever met.  I never felt so comfortable with any other doctor in my life. Through out my pregnancy i learnt more and more about her superpowers and was extremely happy with the treatment. \nTo mention  some of the superpowers are:\n1) she connects so well with all her patients\n2) she remembers all her patients by their names and personalities \n3) she boost confidence in her patients just by her attitude towards the whole phase\n4) she is readily available for any questions any hours of the day you message \n5) An active human being, a doting mother and extremely beautiful and well maintained friendly doctor.\n6) she becomes an inspiration to all she meets \n7) Passionate and dedicated about her job to an extent that amaze others and pull people towards her\n\n Though she was my doctor and the journey with her had to end with my baby boy in this world. I miss talking to her and visiting for the check ups and the voice of her calling my name out though her cabin Dibangana \ud83d\ude0a",

At that time we were consulting another doctor in kamanahalli, a doctor with over 40 years of experience. Once after receovering when i contacted the doctor over phone i was asked the question as to why i was calling her. At that point, we decided that i needed to switch from that doctor. I was recommended Dr Manjula at  Cloud9 horamavu by one of my colleagues. \nWe went for first meeting with her a bit scared as i had just recovered from covid. But she put us completely at ease. In the first meeting itself she stopped quite a few medicines. At each stage she made us aware of the progress and any issues. At one point the baby was becoming too big so she gave advice on controlling my diet and  we were able to control that. In jan i delivered a healthy baby boy.\n\nI would recommend this extremely high energy, positive and friendly doctor to everybody.

Dr.Manjula Deepak is very friendly and explains everything very clearly.\nShe is available 24*7. Even at times of any emergency, she responds to phone calls even during the off hours. Very happy to have been known this doctor!She always remembers patients by their names.\nIn our case, I had few complications at later stage with low amniotic fluid and one loop of umblical cord around baby's neck. Dr Manjula mam filled in me with confidence and prepared me for the delivery.I had water broke at home and mam asked me to admit immediately. Based on advice we immediately got admitted in hospital at 9 PM. Mam met us and walked us thru the plan and again had check up at 1 PM to check the progress.\nI was induced and got pains starting at 3 AM. mam came in morning around 9 AM for check up and told I would deliver by 11 AM. As expected my pains got intense and my sweet angel came into this world at 10.42 AM.As suggested by mam I use to exercise daily which also helped for NVD.\n\nI don't think a doctor can have a better bonding with their patients what you have with yours. Please don't change this. In a way your approach towards your patients make them feel better sometimes without even using medicine.",

Our gratitude to her. 6 months ago,  both, my spouse and myself went through a lot of misinformation over certain scan reports referring to hypoplastiic nasal bone. Prior to consulting Dr. Manjula, our earlier gynaecologist at a different hospital was too abrasive and uncaring, chose not to divulge information as necessary over short nasal bone. In the process, our emotions were heavy and hurt. As things were too bleak and a little time for certain decisions, we were fortunate to come across Dr. Manjula Deepak through a referral from a friend of mine. Since then, our journey had clarity and absolute vision. This, we mainly attribute to the indebt knowledge and guidance from Dr. Manjula Deepak. Very responsive, caring, friendliness and precise communication. This is exactly what we were looking for. Glad, we came across her for my Spouse's 2nd pregnancy. During our 1st visit today (Jan 08, 2021) post delivery, my Spouse was too emotional. This is the connect Dr. Manjula Deepak left us with. Glad we were touched through her guidance. Gratitude from Bhavani, Kayan, little one (baby boy) and Karthick. Pranam \ud83d\ude4f",

All thanks to you mam.... You are one of the great personality I have met.",

We even had PV bleeding in 5th month when our 1st gynaecologist raised her hands and was unable to handle the situation. It was then we were referred to Dr. Manjula and we were awestruck by her immediate response and the way she handled the situation. We were so relieved when she told us baby was doing fine. After that, we were determined to stay under her care only at all cost. She has always been friendly and comforting in her approach. She has the ability to identify the issue immediately and treat accordingly. She always responds immediately for urgent online communication 24*7 and we were completely satisfied to be under her care. I can proudly say that it is because of her that our baby was delivered safely (although preterm due to above said risks, which also she had clearly communicated to us about the pros and cons without hiding anything or giving surprises later).\n\nDr. MANJULA, YOU ARE A BRIGHT AND ENERGETIC STAR. PLEASE KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK AS YOU ARE THE GUIDING LIGHT FOR MANY PEOPLE LIKE US!!!\n\nTHANK YOU!!\nKRISHNA & AKANKSHA..and from our lovely baby too :)",

The best part about her is that she doesn\u2019t make us feel like we\u2019re patients and she\u2019s a doctor, instead she always addresses us by our names and welcomes us like family. She answers all our queries and explains every detail patiently.  I was diabetic and still she made sure my health was all fine and the baby was healthy through her guidance. She\u2019s a God sent angel to me. She\u2019s always reachable on watsapp and a phone call away.. She\u2019s so dedicated towards her patients that she personally takes care of everything.. I\u2019ve seen her eating lunch in odd hours because she was busy with the patients and didn\u2019t  find time for herself.. I\u2019ve never come across such a humble soul in recent times.. Truly service minded doctor.. Myself Vidhya, my husband Prajval and our little angel are really grateful to you. \n\n",

We were consulting another doctor and because of the lockdown could not visit her any more and we were getting a bit worried as we were not sure how is the health of the baby and so we decided to do an online consultation with Dr Manjula. And within few minutes we were confident that we have got the doctor that we were looking for. She was so positive, jovial, friendly and reassuring that all our anxieties took a nose dive. Then when we went to meet her for the appointments, we found her very meticulous in the way everything was planned like scanning and consultations so that we do not have to wait at the hospital for long. On top of it she was readily available on phone or whatsapp for any quick advise that my wife needed. The best thing was that she insisted for a normal delivery which was even more reassuring to us and kept pushing my wife to do all the necessary exercises. My wife's labour pain started late in the night and she came to the hospital at that time and she was her usual jovial self and calmed my wife during the process of delivery and eventually delivered our baby. The way she communicates with her patients and her dedication towards them is actually quite awesome. Thank you is a very insignificant word for all that she has done for us during this journey. We are very grateful to her. We wish her all the best in her future endeavours. Stay Healthy and Stay safe Ma'am\nHaimanti, Partho and the Little One ",

We started consulting with her in my second trimester after having gone through initial complications. She was very quick to understand our issues, requirement as we had just about changed doctors due to the covid situation.\nThen on until our journey to the labor room and welcoming our child into this world has been a journey where she instilled confidence in our minds that all will go well inspite of all the initial hiccups.\nHer approach is straight forward and clear which gives her patients all the confidence required which is all that matters at the end of the day. Faith and confidence that we can and will go through the journey no matter what!\nHer energy and most importantly empathy in the labor room inspite of her having done numerous deliveries is appreciated as this in most cases is the first time for most patients.\nWe highly recommend her as we simply blindly trusted her expertise and kept away from Google!",

Me and my wife consulted her a year ago post a miscarriage, the positivity and confidence that she instilled in us right from our 01st visit has gone a long way. She is very friendly, kind, polite, down to earth and approachable which made my wife comfortable in having candid conversations. Always ensures maintain a positive outlook with complete transparency on clarifying queries. Most importantly she was available when need and we have always received an extended support from her, even during odd hours. The most influential character of her\u2019s is her commitment and knowledge sharing, she ensures to give you complete clarity which made us more dependable, trustworthy. \u201cMinimum Medication with Maximum Care\u201d is her treatment style and she emphasises more on caring, love and physical exercise. She always ensures to maintain the qualities of being proactive and brings an immediate smile on your face.\n\nI would say that she is blessed and had always kept up her words and yes, we were blessed with a healthy baby boy last month. She is truly admirable and we have great respect for her. Thank you so much doctor for your valued guidance, cooperation, confidence and support throughout our journey. Best wishes for your candid professional career.\n\nWe would strongly recommend her for anyone who is looking for a sweet, hassle-free and memorable journey of pregnancy \ud83d\ude09",

In spite of medicines my pain continued and I made a whats App message asking if i could visit her again for which she gave me a remedy home medicine as an answer.With that I am fine now and grateful to the doctor.If need be she could have asked to come and collected her consultation fees,which she didn't.

All our friends and relatives were happy and at the same time surprised by my normal delivery news.. Madam tries max for normal delivery.. One should simply follow her easy exercise tips which helps for smooth pregnancy..\n\nThank you so much from the bottom of hearts for taking such good care of us during and after the pregnancy as well as the delivery!! Because of your professionalism and great smiles, we felt like we were in good hands and that gave us peace of mind towards the big day. \nThank you for helping deliver the most precious gift of our life!!\n\nSangeetha Sagar",

Excellent motivator, always kept our spirits high, very punctual and prompt in her advice on what my wife needed to do. Be it be exercise, diet, next scans and what to watch out for each trimester. Even just before the delivery, she showcased traits of an amazing and determined doctor, visited us multiple times the night we got admitted in the hospital, and thanks to her awareness and super duper skills in the Operation Theatre, the entire birth of my baby was handled by Dr. Manjula with utmost care and perfection and we are now proud parents to a beautiful baby girl born naturally. We are forever indebted to you Doctor. You are definitely one of the best and would recommend you to every potential parent to be. Thanks for everything. ",

I am writing here what I felt about our Doctor and what was her influence all during my wife's pregnancy period and delivery care. To be frankly speaking I don't have words to thank the doctor for taking care of my wife during whole ten months. She is so cool and she never gave us a chance to get worried about anything. She always answers our queries, worries sometimes unwanted ones. She cleared our doubts even though phone. My wife gets tensed so fast even for silly reasons and our doctor was there always to keep her nerves cool. My wife had gone through a low placenta issue, but Dr. Manjula took care of it.  She had never suggested any medication and instead she always pressed for a good diet. Most importantly I need to mention the incident happened one day before the delivery. We approached doctor with a scan report on 39th week which says fluid inside the womb is less and it's almost half only. Hence delivery has to happen immediately not to pose any problem for the baby. That time also doctor was saying 'nothing to worry. We will start the procedure today itself and 95 percent chance is there for the delivery to be normal'. And the delivery was normal. I blindly recommend the doctor for anyone. You husbands can sit and relax if you have doctor Manjula to take care of your wife.",

She doesn't have the typical doctor's superior attitude. She treats everyone equally. After the first visit you will never feel that you are going to meet a doctor. It will be like you are going to visit your friend. She by-hearts your name and history in the first visit itself and she will never forget it.  She knows in and out of all patients' history. She used to answer all the queries how silly it is, through whatsapp or over the phone. \n\nWe met her on 2019 on our friend's recommendation. Before meeting her I had two miscarriages as I am a type -II diabetic. In the first consultation itself she promised us a baby by 2020 and now we are blessed with a baby boy. She took all the necessary actions to make my pregnancy sustainable. This care and actions were missing in my previous two pregnancies. I am super happy about Dr. Manjula. She is awesome!!!!!\n\n",

Eventually after the long wait and due to the fear of infection, she had to conduct c- section. I am glad with the patience with which she dealt with us...I have never seen any doctor to give so much time to a patient. HATS- OFF doctor for this awsum quality you have. Thanks a lot to make this memorable journey more Beautiful!!\ud83d\ude18\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd70\nShe is very much approachable and available 24/7 to address your queries and is very prompt to respond to text messages.",

When I came to Dr. Manjula for 2nd opinion, she just asked me take tablets and go to her for injection only if I experience spotting again. Luckily it was all fine. She is always available on WhatsApp for any queries. She suggests home remedies, exercises and diet which helps for normal delivery. *** **** *** ********* *********** ******* ***** *** *********** \nThough I preferred a normal delivery, I was a bit hesitant about it when we got to know that my baby was a little heavier. But she was very sure that I could make it as I am a yoga instructor. She asked me not to opt for epidural as she was sure that I can bear the pain. She encouraged me a lot in labour room, her voice still echos in my ear. As I requested her not to use forceps, she did not use it even though it was really necessary. Finally I had a normal delivery without epidural of my lil princess who was 3.8kgs. I thank you again for all ur encouragement and support. ",

From the beginning  i wanted  it to be a normal delivery, since the first one was C section and i did not want to go through it again, Doctor Manjula was very supportive and encouraged me to do normal from day one i started seeing her.\nOn Delivery Day:\nThe pain started on April 12th early Morning and it was periodic pain, Morning  7.30AM I did whats-app text to  Dr.Manjula and she asked me to go to Cloud nine by 8:30. She checked me by 9:00 AM and said pain is started it may take 5 to 6 hrs and we will go for normal all looks good. I was took to the Labor room immediately with Husband. Next few hours was horrible since the pain was keep going up and down, by 11:30 they induced pain  and i was not able to bear the pain and i went for the epidural injection to reduce pain, by 2:03PM I delivered a baby boy and they allowed Husband to be with me in the delivery.  It was good instructions and care from Dr. Manjula and nurses from Cloud nine made me it possible. Post delivery I was in the hospital for 3 days and they took care of Baby and me very well.",

On every visit, she provided her valuable comments, feedbacks and next steps which helped in organizing the pregnancy so well. Be it any complication, she has a way to communicate it to us and has all the solutions to make things perfect. While she sees a lot of patients everyday, she still took out some time and provided her feedback on the reports that we used to send over whatsapp (in case we could not make it to the hospital). That shows how much involved she is in her patients and that gave us the confidence in sharing our concerns and asking for clarifications whenever required. I also remember one instance wherein we were worried about the baby movements and wanted to get it scanned but there was no pre planned appointment for the same so we went to Dr. Manjula Deepak and she took out some time from her schedule and did the scan herself just for our satisfaction. On 13th March 2020, she blessed us with our baby boy and we are so thankful and grateful to her that's difficult to express.\nI strongly recommend Dr Manjula Deepak because she not only has immense knowledge of her field but also supports her patients emotionally and make them feel comfortable.\n\nThanks again Dr for everything you have done for us.",

Luckily for us the only thing that kept us going was the constant vigil kept by the nurses and Dr.manjula's reassuring words that despite all this we will deliver the baby normally. and true to her words our baby girl arrived through normal delivery and after 2 weeks of NICU observation, we were delighted to bring our baby girl home. in our family we usually go to mother's hometown for pregnancy after 7th month but I decided way earlier that IAM going ahead with dr.manjula for several reasons and the topmost reason is her ability to reassure me of my doubts and her extreme friendly nature. Now I am going out of way to recommend all our friends and colleagues to go and consult with her. ",

After 4 months of consultation with Doctor I conceived in the month of May with twins.Doctor helped us to deliver our children safely on Dec 6th 2019.My pregnancy journey was not an easy phase as I was put on bed rest due to cervical stitches.Doctor was very helpful and extremely motivational during the entire period. She was very clear in her explanations and we never had any doubts on what was being done.Meeting Doctor would make me really happy and revive my energy. The care and love what doctor gave me made me feel really special and strong.Doctor was always reachable whenever I had doubts and her energy level is simply amazing.I am glad that I had an opportunity to consult with and avail the treatment from Dr Manjula .I would highly recommend her for any gynecology related consultation and treatment. We are grateful to you Doctor for making us feel special in this phase. We love you and will definitely miss meeting you.\n\nLove\nAngel & Manoj\n",

After every meeting with the doctor, I felt more comfortable, confident and happy. \n I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes in the 7th month, she provided me with proper counselling to manage GD.\nWhenever we need any help she helped us. Despite being very busy, she always replied to queries on WhatsApp and we are blessed with a baby girl. \nThank you, ma'am, for support and care. I strongly recommend Dr Manjula Deepak. If you are consulting her then forget all your worries as she will take care of you and your baby. She is an amazing human being, I love her way of treating patients. She is the Best.\n",

After doing some basic research, I have decided to visit Dr. Manjula Deepak by looking at so many wonderful reviews about her. I am very happy with my decision after the first visit itself and I have gained confidence about the doctor. She always used to keep us informed about the progress and the best part is the confidence, awareness and secureness she will fill in our minds during the consultation.\n\nI never have to look back after consulting her and she used to proactively update us about the next phases and precautionary measures. Whenever I have any sort of doubt/query, she used to clarify them through WhatsApp itself. She always used to be very active and concerned, which has made my maternity experience a memorable one.  \n\nShe is a highly recommended gynecologist and her attitude, friendliness, knowledge and availability are qualities to applaud.\nThank you very much doctor",

We had seen commercials of Cloudnine, and it was geographically easy to access from our home and office. Hence we checked on Practo about doctors at this Center. \n\nDr.Manjula Deepak was having very good feedback on practo.  Everyone had mentioned about medical experience and also her friendliness towards patients. \n\nSo we decided to visit her once and then take call if to continue with her or not. First Visit at cloudnine was smooth and quick. \nShe spoke to us very kindly and explained briefly about further steps. We liked the way she communicated and explained things to us.\n\nWe decided to continue to consult her. And we do not regret even for a second.\nShe was very cooperative supportive humble kind (and many more adverbs we can describe her with \ud83d\ude0a) \n\nAll throughout the 9months of pregnancy she was anytime available on Whatsapp and was supportive in every aspect.\n\nShe made sure I don\u2019t gain more than necessary weight and ensure I am on a balanced diet, carry exercises regularly to deliver normally due to which my pregnancy journey went smooth without any hurdles and well managed health condition.\n\nThank you so much doctor for the support, positive attitude and motivation all throughout my pre and post delivery. We will remain indebted to you",

The moment i spoke to her on phone she asked me to reach hospital and within 30 mins she directly reached hospital. Dr. Manjula is very passionate about her duty and I have never seen such a good and humble doctor who is so friendly and caring trying to understand the situation of each person visiting her.\nI would like to thank Dr.Mangula for helping me enjoy my pregnancy period. I would strongly recommend every women to consult Dr. Manjula without even 1% hesitation..",

Initially I choose to consult her by reading online reviews, and later realized that every single word I read about Mam was so true. Through-out my Pregnancy I was very confident that I was in safe hands. She explained everything clearly during consultations. Unnecessary Scans or Tests were not prescribed. To handle problems like nausea, heartburn, cramps etc, she suggested natural ways instead of medication. She always heard my queries and answered them with lot of patience. She was reachable on phone for any doubts/suggestions. She encouraged me for Normal delivery and also suggested lot of physical activities that will help in Normal delivery. She gave me hope till the last minute, but for some other unavoidable reason I had to go for C-Section delivery. She is full of energy, positiveness and confidence. I could see the way she enjoys her work and I really admire that. Me and my husband are glad that we consulted her and we thank Ma'am heart fully for doing a safe delivery for me. Thank you so much Ma'am ! :) :) :) Keep up the good work!",

This was my first pregnancy. We visited Dr. Manjula after seeing very  positive reviews on Practo. As you see in other reviews, she is very friendly, positive  minded, energetic, epathetic and approachable. She always responded to our doubts very quickly on phone. I myself did not expect that I would have a normal delivery as I had complications. I had fibroids which kept increasing in size during pregnancy, got hypothyroidism, gestational diabetes and growth of the baby was not at par with the standard benchmarks. When we were worried about all these, she kept us motivated and kept building our confidence. She did not prescribe  unnecessary medicines and suggested diet and excercises that  helped to have a normal delivery. We had to get admitted to the hospital at 9 pm due to amniotic fluid leakage and delivered at midnight around 2.30. Doctor was available during these odd times and guided the staff to go every thing smoothly. We are fortunate to find Dr. Manjula Deepak and highly recommend her.",

I came back to India and consulted Dr. Manjula Deepak. She immediately gave treatment for acidity. She also advises Ayurveda medicine for treatment. I also had soft cervix which caused bleeding in my 2nd trimester. She treats all kinds of complications in an ease. \n      Dr.Manjula Deepak will try for normal delivery. She will never give up on that. \nI had normal delivery and blessed with baby girl. Entire credit goes to my doctor. \n       Doctor is very very friendly. She is highly energetic.She patiently answers how many ever questions u ask. She always boosts confidence in you. \n   One of the best quality of her is she will responds any time you call her or msg her. After my delivery also if any doubts I used to msg her. Doc will respond immediately.\n    My pregnancy journey was good only because of Dr.Manjula. We are very grateful to you mam till our lifetime.\n     I strongly recommend Dr.Manjula Deepak to everyone. U will be in safe hands. \n\nThanks and Regards,\nShwetha D R ",

We met her as soon as we conceived and it's been 10 months since (our baby girl is a month old). \nShe made us feel happy, excited, confident and comfortable in every visit. I used to look forward to our gynaec visits. She's caring and friendly, almost family like. You'll always leave a consultation with a smile on your face after meeting her, that's the level of positivity she exudes. She'd answer all my questions within minutes, silly or otherwise, which is what you need as an expectant mother. \n\nAs for the delivery, I had to have an emergency a C section as my water broke and the labour wasn't progressing.  She tried her best for a normal delivery while monitoring my baby and me for any signs of distress through the night. I have no regrets about the c section as the procedure was equally great with her. I walked the next day and was discharged in a Couple of days. We're proud parents to our baby and are proud to have been with Dr. Manjula during this journey!\nLove you, doc!",

Dr.Manjula Deepak madam is one of the dynamic doctor I have ever seen who treats her patients like a family with a great smile :-) always. She took care of me throughout my pregnancy and feel blessed to be treated by such a nice doctor. She was available for all the queries on whatsapp and phone calls also. She listens and answers each and every doubt as well as explains everything in detail until the satisfaction is achieved. One great thing about Manjula madam is, she always tries to push pregnant patients for Normal delivery. Emphasis on diet and exercise only. During labor, with a touch she knew whether I had contractions and she was spot on. After that, she was still at the hospital until 3 am to welcome our little baby boy to this world safe. I was amazed to see her care and concentration during my delivery, my post delivery recovery too was quick and it took hardly a week to recover from stitches pain. I'm very satisfied with the care and attention that I have received from the doctor. I do recommend her and request every visitor to place your trust in her and can with confidence say she will stay by it. I sincerely pray for a long life 100 years for you Manjula madam so that many more healthy babies see this world safe :-) Thanks a ton..\n\n\n",

I visited our Dr. For pregnancy counseling as we were planning to have a baby ! Few months later, when I tested positive for pregnancy, we decided her to be our gynaecologist!! And that's the best thing that happened to us. Since we were first time parents , there were lot of times where we were anxious, worried and nervous. But our Dr. Always and always had a smile on her face and relieved us with all our tension! She encouraged me to live the way I am with only few dietary restrictions. Her hearty welcome to the hospital will make you forget everything and you will really really start enjoying your pregnancy! She treats you like a family and genuinely cares about you, like how our mothers would ! Be it scans, consultations and finally the delivery and post delivery as well she was always there besides us !! My baby and our family really thank her for the support she has given throughout. Words are not enough for an angel like her ! She is an inspiration to many women and how passionate she is about what she does , shows in her work !!! You will always see her bubbly and cheery all the time !!! I wonder how does she do it !!! I wish I could upload a pic of ours with Dr. But I guess practo doesn't have that option !!!! All in all thaaaaaaaaaaaaaank you so much for everything Dr. Manjula!!! \n\nYours sincerely\nSwati and Ajay ",

Despite having many challenges with hospital the only driving force to the hospital was you Mam. The best quality of Manjula mam is she will remember everyone's names and will call so affectionately. You are a wonderful human being and a best doctor i have ever met.\n\nWhen I am tensed how is the delivery going to happen etc , the words which said like Nothing will happen I AM THERE WILL TAKE CARE which gave me immense strength. I hope i need a book to write about you Mam.\n\nI Pray God should give good health and prosperity to you Doctor so that you can give the same happiness to many families. \n\nThank you so much once again Manjula Mam.

We had a lot of concern on complications and issues I may go through becoz of the age factor during this pregnancy. But Manjula mam was very supportive though out the complete 9 months of my pregnancy and even after. I always felt nice, and relaxed after each consultation with her. She was very calm and gave her ears to both me and my spouse in explaining each and every questions/concerns through out this process. She always explains everything in details, whether the scan report, or another change in medication. One of her best qualities is she does remember her patient names and their details by heart.,this touched me a lot. Sometime I used to take my daughter along with me during consultation, and she loved Manjula Mam a lot. With Manjula Mam I always felt the warmth and closeness which is much needed for a pregnant lady during her critical period. Due to higher water level I had to go through C-section (even my first kid was through c-section, and I always wanted c-section) and operation went on very smoothly. I am really thankful to Dr. Manjula for all kind of support with best guidance through out and now we are blessed with a healthy baby boy. I would surely recommend everyone looking forward for such great care to visit Dr. Manjula Mam. Best regards from Rupernita & Gyana.",

When my wife(kiranmai) got conceived, we were worried about which doctor to consult for the checkup. We got to know about Dr. Manjula Deepak and took a chance to consulter her. After the very first meeting we were confident about consulting Dr. Manjula Deepak for the rest of the pregnancy period. She is soo friendly, energetic and very patient about answering all the queries we have got. The way she addresses and treats the patients shows us how much she loves her job.Even though the delivery date was in Feb, my wife started to get labour pains in Jan mid. It was mid night and I called Dr. Manjula Deepak for the suggestion. Without hesitation she enquired about the situation and asked us to get to the hospital. By the time we reached the hospital, staff knew that we were coming as the Dr already informed. So my wife got admitted immediately with out any delay. She reached the hospital at mid night and assured us that everything is going to be fine. She had taken all the measures so that normal delivery could happen inspite of all the  complications. And finally after 8 hours inside the labour room we are blessed  with a baby boy. We very grateful to Dr. Manjula Deepak for all the great care she had taken for us.",

In our journey of parenthood - Manjula Deepak was the one. From the onset, she made us feel at ease and was always ready to listen. All our queries, however trivial it may seem was listened patiently and responded to our satisfaction.Mine being a complicated and high risk pregnancy, there was remote chances of having a normal delivery. However Doc Manjula always encouraged me to be active and exercise regularly and most importantly assured me that she would try her best. I will never forget her example of the cricket match she cited, where you dont quit till the last minute - even if chances are odd. For me to deliver was no less than a miracle and would like to give the entire credit to my wonderful doctor.             Its incumbent for every doctor to be knowledgeable and to know their stuff, ******* ***** **** ***** ********* ************* Doctor Manjula is gifted with a wonderful personality which makes the patient feel extremely comfortable and in safe hands.We will always be indebted to Doc Manjula for giving us the greatest gift of our life.

She said nothing to worry,did a scan and explained us the reason for pain. She was very friendly and caring . Though it was the first meeting and \u00a0our IVF doctor referred to her,she did follow up with us when we left the hospital.That was the time we decided to continue with her if I get pregnant in the IVF cycle.Though ours was IVF pregnancy, but she always made me feel it's normal pregnancy and have never recommended any unnecessary tests or scans. At every visit she made us feel so confident and comfortable, Because of her our pregnancy was a cake walk and I love the way she call me by my name and always say good girl. I have rarely come across such warm personality and that's her big asset..she was always approachable over the call and WhatsApp and we never felt alone in the journey. We wanted to deliver our first baby on 15th August as it was near to our due date. Though it was a public holiday,still she came at early morning and gave us our bundle of joy, our baby boy..Thank you so much from bottom of our heart, may God bless you always and please keep the sweet smile on your face.Regards,Sudipta and Basab. regards",

With all apprehensions in mind, we first consulted Dr. Manjula. But she assured that regular conception may take some more time & asked us to try again for some months before going for any further treatment. Our next consultation with her was within 2 months' time and that too when I was 6 weeks pregnant! What struck us most about Dr. Manjula is her happy go lucky attitude, which can ease out the worries of any patient. I would say that we chose to consult at Cloudnine hospital only because of her.She had patiently addressed all our queries during my term of pregnancy. Her assurance also made me easily sail through my pregnancy term. Even with my weight issues, she kept on reinstating faith that I can have a normal delivery.Even during the day of delivery, as I was losing all strength, she coaxed me further to maintain my strength & deliver normally.It has been a great experience with her.Thanks a lot Doctor! Regards,Archana & KrishnanPS : Looks can be deceptive. Don't think that as she looks so young, she may be lacking experience* * *** ***** **** *** *** **** *** ** *** **** ******* * **** ********* ** **** ",

I am indeed short of words to thank and describe how elegantly Dr Manjula doctored the delivery of our first child. By God's grace, with loads of blessings from well wishers and with Doctor's ******** medical advise and assurances, my beautiful wife Naziya delivered a lovely boy :-)\n\nLike any other first timers, we were on tenterhooks about this pregnancy, but it was Dr. Manjula's poise that helped to simmer us down throughout the journey. She is confident, spirited, very friendly and never short on energy :-) Her continuous aplomb gave us the confidence and belief in a normal delivery, and rightly so Naziya delivered normally.\n\nDr. Manjula was always available when needed, be it on phone or in person and hence Naziya never missed a chance to trouble her;-) The Food and medicines prescribed, the chores advised and the exercises recomended by her were excellent and have helped every bit in a smooth delivery and a healthy baby.\n\nI must also add, the facilities and services at cloudnine are par excellence too, the supporting doctors we met, the management we consulted, the pharmacists we bought from  and last but not the least, the nurses and staff that attended to us have got us elated in every facet.\n\nI wish Dr. Manjula Deepak and her team all the very best, keep up the good work and continue spreading happiness :-)",

She never suggests unnecessary tests and is always concerned that we don't undergo unnecessary expences. \nVisited her first for my first pregnancy. Unfortunately,underwent a miscarriage. She believes in natural way of treatment wherever possible. She asked me to wait and let the cleaning process happen naturally and thankfully no medicine or dnc was needed. Then i went to my hometown for a second opinion. The doctor there exaggerated things up and did too many tests and ultimately told the same thing which dr.manjula had said without doing any tests. This made us trust her even more.\n Then we went ahead with her for my second pregnancy. We were too scared this time but doctor always made sure we were relaxed after every visit. She has a very positive approach in the way she handles her patients. \nShe is very hardworking and sincere towards her work.\nShe always insisted me to walk and exercise during my pregnancy so that i can deliver normally.\n\nAnd yes,it happened. I delivered a baby boy on 31st march normally. Even during delivery process, she made sure my mind was diverted and she was cracking jokes.\nWould always recommend dr.manjula to everyone.",

Though not a fan of visiting hospitals, I felt right at home interacting with Dr. Manjula. She had a very positive attitude and was supportive since day 1, though there could have been areas of concern she managed them very well and resorted to more natural means like exercises, food recommendations and healthy practices. \n\nShe was very prompt to respond to calls and messages on emergency despite her hectic sched. On the day of delivery when I was not very sure of what next, she invited me to one of her practicing hospitals checked me in between her schedule and directed next steps and within the next 2.5 hours I was holding my newborn in my arms. \n\nI thank God for Dr. Manjula and grateful for her service, she helped us have the best moment of our life with nothing to be worried about.  Thank all the doctors like Dr. Manjula for your care and support in our well being.\n\nNo doubt, you will be remembered the rest of our lives.\n\n-Shalini and Gabriel \n\n",

I Would like to thank Dr Manjula Deepak for the treatment of my wife and my 2 babies, doctor is very friendly , available all the time though she is busy make sure our queries are answered anytime 24/7, clears all our doubts . Thank you doctor for being their all the time. She is just not a doctor ,she is a friend, family member ,well-wisher and guide .We feel pampered each time we visit the doctor. God\u2019s gift to all the mother's to be.\nI referred my colleague to consult the doctor and she also had normal delivery and she thanked us so much for referring and also we are still referring to our friends.\n\n1st pregnancy \u2013 baby girl, normal delivery. \nDuring 5th month pregnancy the amniotic fluid was less and there was blockage in placenta, doctor gave proper supplements and the fluid level increased which prevented preterm birth, also the case was placenta previa. Doctor encouraged us and every time we visit we had positive thoughts as she never spoke any negative thing and made sure my wife will have normal delivery which indeed it was full term 40 weeks. Thanks to doctor. \n\n2nd pregnancy \u2013 baby boy, normal delivery.\nThis time throughout pregnancy the amniotic fluid was beyond high range and the baby growth was more also the head circumference was little high which was problem for normal delivery. But doctor gave strict diet to follow and check for fluid level often and after completion of 37 weeks my wife had normal delivery. \n\nLastly I have seen doctor in hospital during day time attending patients in OPD with full enthusiasm and positive mood even though she will be in labor ward during night, the way she manage and carry herself is great. Her energy and commitment towards work is inspiration. \n",

By that time I have already met 4 doctors and none of them gave me a positive hope.  Nurse just asked me to meet Manjula ma'am and I agreed. Me and my husband both shared our problems with details of complications and issues. After listening to everything she was very calm and said don't worry its a \"miracle baby\" and everything will be fine. We were shocked to see her reaction and calmness but we totally believed and followed her. From the first day she has been our support, the confidence she has given was remarkable. She was available day and night and has patiently handled me throughout my pregnancy. I was very scared looking at the reports all the time but she was very confident from day 1 which was actually our biggest strength. We were alone in Bangalore due to pandemic but with her support we managed all very easily. I can't thank her enough for what she did and the strength and confidence she gave us during these times. I delivered my child early morning and she was there with me. She has always been answering our n no. of questions patiently. She is so dedicated, after my delivery she used to visit me late night, early morning to check if everything is okay.

She has supported us a lot before pregnancy, during pregnancy and after delivery. Her treatment, moral support and positivity has given us the news \"pregnancy +VE\" one day. \n\nShe was always making us to feel comfortable, happy and stay positive and we were always excited for our routine visits. We used to write all our questions on a piece of paper and she answers all of our questions, even though some of those are silly :)\n\nAfter 3 months of pregnancy, we were started taking insulin due to gestational diabetes. Gradually the insulin doses gone high. She was with us in all situations and during all the scans. She always responds to all our queries, calls and messages. \n\nIn 36 weeks of pregnancy, we couldn't feel the baby movememt. We called her and she told, immediately meet in the hospital. After the growth scan, she quickly consulted with Pediatrician and Endocrinologist due to the complications. Baby's growth was little ahead, couldn't move properly and heartbeats were decreasing slowly. \n\nDr. Manjula told \"this baby is very very precious for me and I will do the delivery by tonight or tomorrow morning. Don't worry, I will take care of both baby and mother. We can't induce labour, as both baby & mother are not ready at this time and it can be a risk for both. It will be a C-section.\"\n\nNext day morning, \"Blessed with a baby GIRL:)\"\n\nUnfortunately, Puspa became breathlessness in the next day early morning. Dr. Manjula came in the morning and immediately shifted to ICU. She was visiting ICU in a regular interval, taking frequent followups from ICU and after one day situation was under control. Discharged from hospital in next couple of days.\n \nWe are happy parents to our princess now and are really blessed to have Dr. Manjula with us.\n\nGod bless Dr. Manjula in all her endeavours!!!\n\nWith lots of Love, \nSaanvika (now 1 month), Puspa and Dillip\n",

She is one who filled positivity in me and my husband in our difficult phase of pregnancy. Ok , let me explain what we went through in our pregnancy journey and how we over came it by Manjula mam. I got pregnant in October 2020 , consulted doctor in another hospital and we got confirmed that we are pregnant. As all others even we were very happy for our baby and initial scans went well. Next came Anamoly scanning where doctor scared us saying baby is growing abnormal and asked us to go for NIPT test. Me and my partner were very much scared to go for it , Later my cousin suggested Manjula mam , we took appointment and went to her. That was the best decision we both made , she saw all our old reports and said all good no need to go for any sort of test and she didn't even asked us to go for Anamoly scanning again , she just asked us to come for growth scanning in 7th month by filling all positivity in us. We trusted her and did our baby's growth scanning too. Issue was baby's weight and it had maintained well. Later again in 8th month there was fluctuations in weight but still doctor didn't scare us and gave me good supplements which really helped baby grow well. All that we were expecting was a healthy baby with good weight. Again in 9th month baby's weight was just 1.8kg , but still doctor didn't scare us and motivated me walhat all to eat and make baby weight gain more. Repeatedly AFI was there to check water level and by mam's and god's grace  we couldn't even  believe baby's weight and water level was maintained well. On June 18th as per doctor's suggestion I delivered my cute little princess through c section and we couldn't believe baby's weight was 2.72KG where in our dreams also we didn't imagine. Even for delivery mam tried max for normal one whole day , since baby's head didn't support at the end she went for immediate c section. Than all , baby was healthy which is most important \u263a\ufe0f All this credits really goes to Manjula mam who made our pregnancy journey go well by delivering healthy baby. Thanks a lot mam\u263a\ufe0f I would really recommend her for each and every girl who likes her pregnancy journey to go well.",

I found Dr. Manjula on Practo, and I am so glad we decided to consult her as our doctor during my pregnancy. I first visited her when I was 14 weeks pregnant, and since then there was no looking back  Dr.Manjula's care, sincerity and high energy at every visit touched our hearts,and we felt we met out guardian angel on Earth. She has been by our sides at every back and call, always responding to my queries, and questions,and trying to soothe my anxiety when I read up too much on the internet and asked her all kinds of questions regarding pregnancy. The ride, has not been smooth, just as other medical cases in general. I was diagnosed with GDM during my 28th week, which was borderline, and a nutritionist put me on  strict GDM diet. Between weeks 28-35 I had an intuition that my baby's growth in-vitro might have been restricted with reduced baby movements,and when I finally voiced this concern to Dr.Manjula, she immediately guided me on next steps. Based on the test results,we jointly decided to deliver my baby the very next day through C-section. We are now proud parents of a beautiful baby boy, all because of Dr.Manjula's expertise and timely decisions. I believe the Dr.-patient relationship has evolved and matured over time and I look forward to our prolonged association, for her guidance and advice at every step. Thank you Dr. for all that you do for each of your patients. May God Bless You Always!",

We are blessed with baby girl and she is 1 month old now :).\n\nIt was our first baby so we were very excited but at the same time we were little afraid as well due to the Covid-19 situation. ** ****** ** ***** *** **** ****** ** ** ******** ** *** ******** *** ****** ** **** ** *** ******** even friends of friends and got to know about Dr Manjula. During our first visit we were still not sure if the decision was right, but all these confusions went off once we met her and we decided to continue with her. The best thing about her is she never makes her patients feel that they are meeting a doctor. It always feels like we are meeting our friend. She always calls the patient with name and even remembers patient's husband's name and calls him also with name.\n\nWe consulted her till 7 months of my pregnancy but due to Covid situation we planned the delivery in my native. During our travel we needed \"Fit to Fly\" certificate and we would like to thank the cloudnine staff that within half an hour they prepared the document, get it signed by the doctor and provided us on whatsapp. Even we would like to thank the doctor that she gave her precious time and helped us with priority.\n\nEven after reaching there we were always in touch with her. We got a doctor there and even she was good but no one can match Dr. Manjula. We were always thinking whether the decision to move to our native was right or not. But Dr Manjula was just a call away from us. Still she was supporting us and we were so open to her that even for some silly questions we used to whatsapp her. She patiently replied to all our queries on whatsapp as well as on call. Finally a little angel came into our lives through normal delivery. The exercise suggested by her helped us a lot.\n\nEven post delivery we are still in touch with her and she still replies us very patiently. Waiting to see you doctor and thank you personally once we reach Bangalore.",

She is such a positive, extremely down to earth, very caring, very friendly doctor. She patiently clears all our doubts and concerns. This was my 2nd\u00a0pregnancy where I started consulting her from day 1 of my 2nd pregnancy. I was so tensed because of previous history\u00a0of gestational diabetes\u00a0and BP and I had preterm delivery at 34th week of baby girl who was just 2.1 Kg , because of which I was under depression post 1st\u00a0delivery. But my 2nd\u00a0pregnancy went so smooth and happily in the hands of Dr. Manjula Deepak, she gave me the confidence and took proper care of me and everything went really well, and we were blessed with a baby boy on 5th August.\n\nIt is only because of her, that my entire 2nd pregnancy period went well without any tensions, because she knew how to keep us confident. I was so confident and positive during entire 9 months. I had no complications of gestational diabetes\u00a0and BP like earlier. I feel so happy about have baby weight i.e 3 KG with no complications. Its all because of my Dr Manjula Deepak. She is miracle I would say.\n\n*** *** **** ********* *** her timely advice and actions really helped me. She will never make us tensed and she knows what to do. She is available in both WhatsApp and call for us anytime.\n\nI was so tensed about operation as well. But Dr. Manjula Deepak was inside the Operation Theatre, with ever charming smile and positive approach. All was done and she told I had a baby boy and she gave me 1st\u00a0hug of my baby. I was talking to doctor even during operation, I never felt scared or tensed, all went well, and I recovered very soon like in 3 /4 days. After 10 days I started doing everything at home, as I never felt pain.\n\nShe is very happily and dedicatedly doing her profession. She is the only Dr I have seen who took her\u00a0PROFESSION AS SERVICE. Looks for patient\u2019s health and mindset. She never treats the patient for the sake of money.\u00a0\n\nI strongly recommend Dr.Manjula Deepak to everyone and if you are consulting her, there is nothing to worry as she will take care of you and your baby, her friendliness is the most I love in her. I would even say I love her a lot for her simplicity.\u00a0 ",

We have been seeing her for all the pregnancy checkups and would like to say with out a doubt that she deserves a special mention for all the efforts she takes in dealing with patients. Although she is busy never failed to respond to queries on watsup.I have called her and messaged her for every single doubt that I had she replied me in no time which has always given me abundant confidence. She encourages us and help us prepare our body for 100% normal delivery  I haven't seen a doctor putting so much effort on exercises that we do like sqauts, walking etc she never prescribes unnecessary medications.  Finally on the D-day, started off with my baby passing motion and I called up the doctor immediately and she arranged Ambulance from whitefield cloud nine which is close by home and made me feel comfortable by the time is reached HRBR Cloud nine and felt very stress free as soon as I saw her, I strongly believe that her hands are magical. I would like to thank Srilu my friend who referred the doctor. Haven't seen a doctor who is always available for patients. My mom,sister and grandmom are very impressed the way she has been with me through out pregnancy and they feel am lucky for being delivered in her hands. Thankyou million tons doctor!!! I can't end my review here for the positivity you gave me through out the pregnancy will definitely recommend doctor to all my friends. ",

She is ocean of courage her I'm not exaggerating any one meets her can sense her unbeatable confidence ,which helped me to stay confident throughout my delivery in Labor room. I took treatment for my pregnancy  outside but Consulted for normal delivery as I was 37weeks plus when I consulted with Manjula.I came to know about her from practo after reading many experiences people had with her,I just thought to try second opinion from her.But In just one visit she passed her confidence and my husband too confident we decided to admit on same day as he was wishing our baby to see on gowri festival 12th September 2018 .Previous day admitted after consulting her and as per our wish she delivered our baby at the time we mentioned on gowri festival. My first kid Iwas normally delivered this was second and I was not so confident I will deliver normally bcoz of many complications I faced in last trimester but Manjula made our wish come true as this was too NVD. She is highly flexible very friendly with her patients, she carries herself in good sense her presence gives positive vibes all around after our beautiful experience with Dr. Manjula I referred my own sister her pregnancy confirmed there itself in hospital.So from day one my sister and her husband getting treatment and they literally celebrating her pregnancy. Dr. Manjula make every pregnancy Wellness instead of Illness why I'm telling this is bcoz my sister told me she don't write more medicines instead she encourages to go for home remedies and to stay natural.She strongly believes in normal delivery and urges each of her patients to believe in it. Even though she is most busy Doctor and has huge number of patients, she gives each one of them special care and attention.Overall we are very satisfied with our association with the Doctor and her service is very highly recommended. Special thanks to Cloudnine, their staff, nurses, other duty doctors who were in labor room helped a lot to welcome our bundle of happiness:-)                                     Kind Regards.

She treats them as her own which is very rare in today\u2019s world. We have been consulting her from past 6 months and every visit has been strengthening and morale boosting to my wife. Specially her tone and her voice gives lot of relief to patients. Our earlier doctor never is to answer nor reply to messages but with doctor Manjula we always had responses and right solutions. We just can\u2019t forget how she was positive and confident of doing a normal delivery to my wife, on the contrary me and my wife had decided to go for C as my wife was not ready to bear the pain. It was a perfect 24hrs action. My wife had her water bag discharged in the night at 3pm on 12th without pain which is very risky for normal delivery. We called doctor at 3am early morning when she was busy in delivery at old airport road, she answered our call and advised us rush immediately to a hospital which was close my in laws home. She also called the hospital and instructed them to take care of us and in the meantime she will reach us. She came all the way to hrbr layout to see my wife, understood the situation and guided us to go old airport road cloud9. Upon reaching we were taken care so well as she had informed the hospital people about our situation. Being remotely she was getting updates of my wife\u2019s status. My wife was going through a pain which she could not bear. At 230pm she visited us and assured of good improvement and told us the delivery will happen by 8. When she came at 830pm the true climax started. According to doctor the delivery was supposed be happening in 35 to 40 minutes but with my wife\u2019s condition was not easy and she was feeling too difficult. The efforts went till mid night 1215 finally it was a normal delivery. I would have written the feedback in 4 lines but it was very important to say how doctor handheld us in every step. Doing C was such an easy act but doctor Manjula Deepak did not give up. Thank you is nowhere enough. Me and my wife will remain greatful to her forever. Hats off to you Dr. Manjula Deepak, a true human being and good doctor. ",

She is very busy but still has memory and remembers all her patients and history. After C-section  i had a hard recovery but she really encouraged me and helped me and i felt so much better to under her care. \nWould 100% recommend Dr Manjula for pregnancy and childbirth she\u2019s really amazing!

Occasionally, she simply listens patiently. Simply knowing that she is your doctor will give you immense confidence. I highly recommend her to anyone.",

Those 9 months is a happy period for us and finally the day came to welcome our lil one. The support and confidence she had given during labour time was so great. She came in the middle of the night after my admission in the hospital just to comfort me to go through normal delivery as I was very scared of and chosen to go for c section. But it was then manjula who supported and made the journey smooth and fantastic. I would have gone for c section if it's not you. She was there when I needed her most. Even my mother in law liked the way Manjula handled the patients. These are the words from my mother in law, You are lucky to have this kind of doctor these days.' Trust her, she gives the best.

And it would have been a preterm baby. As first time parents we we scared and tense especially for the baby. \n\nEnter Dr Manjula!! In our first meeting only she did all the tests herself and verified that the situation was not that bad as portraited. \nShe set up a proper plan and guided us through the whole process. \nWe are very grateful and thankful for Dr Manjula for all her attention and positive support. \n\nShe will always be available for help or glad to clarify any questions. \nShe works really hard and takes the right direction in the interest of patients. \nShe helped make the whole journey till the time of dilivary really smooth. \nWe would also like to point out the cloud nine Hormavu staff as well are really supportive and professionals. They value ur time and situation and care about you. \nThank you Dr Manjula for such great support during our difficult times.!! God bless!! ",

We were very apprehensive & nervous as it was first pregnancy but she has this great energy with her and by just talking with her she will fill you up with optimism and confidence. \nIn last few days my fluid level had decreased a lot, and normal delivery would have been very difficult. But Dr Manjula was vey confident and pushed us for normal delivery. Her confidence and expertise motivated us and we blindly trusted her. Throughout delivery she was very supportive, positive and kept on encouraging. We were blessed with a baby girl and both me and baby were healthy.

This itself shows how dedicated and committed she is towards her work.She kept me motivated throughout the pregnancy & delivery. It was my first child, so I was a bit nervous but her saying \u201cits okay and all normal\u201d would always keep me assured.She was compassionate & proactively handled all situations. During the last scan when AFI came down, she immediately induced labour and did a successful normal delivery. I had this normal delivery only because of her support & guidance. She was always available on WhatsApp for any queries. She is a true gem of a human being and the best doctor out there.

We went with people's review and thankfully we did not regret.Dr Manjula truly deserves all the appreciation. She is compassionate, personable and expert in her medical filed.There are many best things about her like , she will make you super comfortable with her in the 1st meeting with a dynamic smiling face, how she focuses on normal delivery etc etc. During the entire tenure of pregnancy she motivated my wife to stay active and eat healthy. She also goes in for minimal medications and testing and believes that a natural process like pregnancy needs no intervention unless really required.She has been super patient in answering our questions sometime silly questions. She have been always there on WhatsApp support during hard times and late night.Thank you so much Dr Manjula Deepak. Would definitely recommend her :-)",

My delivery was through induction of artificial labor. The case got little complicated as baby heart beat was fluctuating and baby had passed motion. The dilation was also slow still doctor showed patience and finally I delivered my baby girl through a normal delivery. It was truest a miracle. All thanks to doctor for such a memorable journey through my pregnancy and my labor. ",

Her calm, friendly and composed nature gave me a sense of satisfaction and assurance that I was in safe and well experienced hands.She answers to all the queries in a very calm manner and makes sure you are walking out without any doubts and questions in your head which is not the case with most of the gynacs.My 39-40th week was quite dramatic but she was always there around making sure that I am been treated and taken good care of whether it was pregnancy related or other health related issues.She was always there answering my issues at any time of the day or night. And on the grand day she carried out her procedure so smoothly without creating any panick environment, indulging me in a conversation throughout the procedure that I dint even realize when it all started and there she was holding the love of my life, my lil princess.

The best part was that she shared with us her WhatsApp number in case of emergency and she was very responsive on Whatsapp as well.

I started my consultation for pregnancy and concluded that I wasn't able to due to a cyst. post removal of cyst i still went thru some issues and finally 6 months later I got pregnant.She helped me throughout this process which took over 7 months before pregnancy and 9 months post pregnancy. Throughout my pregnancy she was constantly keeping a check on what I ate, my weight ,babyz weight,  exercises.I followed every single thing and I had a normal delivery without epidural. During labor too she kept me distracted  by having conversations and cracking jokes. I am so thankful I met her..Its 7 months post delivery and if i still msg her for any health related issue i still get a reply..I would recommend  her to the whole world if I could.",

My pregnancy journey with her has been amazing. She is always positive and so full of energy, tends to make u feel comfortable and happy. I would suggest this doctor for every mom to be. She is always reachable when in need or emergency. Thanks to Dr. Manjula Deepak for being such a wonderful warm person and for being extremely supportive.

I must specially mention that the exercises she gave me kept me free of backache during pregnancy (which was a huge relief). I continue to remain fit and free of backache even post-delivery. I will always remain grateful to Dr Manjula for the exceptional care given to me during this 9 months and for making it a truly cherishable experience.",

I would definitely recommend her to all my friends & acquaintances.\n\nDr Manjula will respond to your offline queries over sms phone calls without making you feel like you disturbing her round the clock 24 hr now a days doctor giving mobile no itself is big deal and if they give they ll put a word don't call me so n so time but we felt vry much comfortable with Dr Manjula she is one of a kind..  I would say anyone doesn't matter how complicated your pregnancy is just visit her and you are safe..  We had requested for 7-8 am delivery in morning and doctor attended and was on time even though she was sick that's d dedication ..\n\n God bless you doctor long live .",

I had lot of complications during my pregnancy. But doctor helped me to overcome all those problems and I delivered a baby boy on 4th July. It was a normal delivery. From the day one of our consulation till today she was there with us. She will reply for all our msgs or calls at any time.  Initially I was planning to go to my native place for my delivery. But after  consulting Dr. Manjula I changed my mind. She really appeared like a God for us. She gave us the most happiest moment in our life. I would  really like to recommend Dr. Manjula Deepak. Thank u mam for all the expert guidance and support.",

Her smile and warmth is, enough for one to sail through any tough times in pregnancy. She helped us through out the pregnancy with a lot of patience and constantly encouraged me towards a healthy pregnancy. We were able to reach her just over of phone 24x7. She literally hand held me through my delivery, calming me constantly. I had normal delivery inspite of having low levels of amniotic fluid. She had been very much accurate in all the decisions that she took during my pregnancy.\nWe are blessed with healthy baby girl.\n\nAll thanks to Dr. Manjula, we love you.\n",

Her experience and skill is unique , she is straightforward -which very few people are nowadays. Does not mince her words, comes to the point and educates us on what can and has to be done. Inspite of the current pandemic situation, she puts her life at risk, all to ensure the couple has a beautiful end to their pregnancy saga. In my opinion , the hallways of Cloud 9 are filled with people due to her presence. \nThank you for all that you do for strangers who put their trust in you.

She made me and my husband feel so comfortable that we used to look forward to all our checkups. She only  encourages her patients to have normal delivery so every checkup involved me showing her if I did my squats and yoga poses correctly  and thanks to her I had a normal delivery even though I had few complications during my labour and now I\u2019m blessed with a healthy baby boy.\n I had the best experience with Dr. Manjula, pregnancy as well as the delivery. I would choose her again as my doctor in a heartbeat \n",

I know choosing a doctor / hospital for your pregnancy is so confusing and have to go by many opinions, I started consulting Dr.Manjula from my 35th week of pregnancy after being referred by my friend Priya & Murali who had a pleasant experience consulting the doctor. \nThough our journey was for a short span of time, she guided us in a very friendly manner regarding everything. She is very much proactive in her approach and does not believe in taking chances and risks. I must say she is well versed with her skills and knowledge. On 15th of October 2020, I was blessed with my first child, a baby boy and had a NORMAL delivery. Yes! I know, Normal delivery is not common nowadays. All thanks to my Dr Manjula Deepak, for her commitment and right decision making skills.\n\nTrust me, with Dr. Manjula, you are in safe hands.\n",

I was lucky enough to have found Dr Manjula early on this year, who delivered by baby in October, 2020.  I've already recommended her to my sister-in-law and will do so to my cousins as well. ",

She waited for 15 long hours and made sure I had a safe and normal delivery. Her positive energy is so infectious that it will take away all your wories, fear and anxiety.Myself and my family are blessed to have her deliver my baby, she is god sent gift to all the mothers and babies she has delivered forever grateful to her.\nI had travelled from germany to India for delivery during this covid-19 situation and i must say thats the best thing that has happened none of the facilities there could have matched the presence of Dr Manjula\u2764\ufe0f",

At every visit she made us feel so confident and comfortable, Because of her our pregnancy was a cake walk and I love the way she call me by my name and always say good girl. I have rarely come across such warm personality and that's her big asset..she was always approachable over the call and WhatsApp and we never felt alone in the journey. We wanted to deliver our baby on 13th September as it was near to our due date. Though it was a public holiday,still she came at early morning and gave us our bundle of joy, our baby girl..Thank you so much from bottom of our heart, may God bless you always and please keep the sweet smile on your face.\nRegards, \nSwati & Hemant ",

With not much help coming our way from our existing doctor, Dr. Manjula proved to be a guardian angel. Her cheerful and co operative attitude calmed us down and thereafter she guided us throughout the term  all the way upto the delivery which in the end also was a bit of an emergency but was handled very deftly by her and i gave birth to a bonny boy. She is understanding and patient, very approachable and most importantly reachable at all times. You can almost always expect a call back incase her phone goes unanswered . I would highly recommend her to all. My pregnancy journey  definitely was lot more easier and stress free with her. \n\n\n",

We consulted  Dr Manjula Deepak through walk-in and it's been an extremely pleasant experience. More importantly our suspicions are put to rest as each and every move pertaining to medicine and checkups are well briefed. Dr Manjula connects with individual personally and I feel it's a terrific way to bring in confidence to both mother and father. Unnecessary check ups and medicine is not recommended by the Dr and she prefers natural remedy over medicine, which is again a brilliant reassurance. Overall, Value for money, value addition and would rate  5 out of 5.  I would highly recommend specially for people in dilemma. ",

But then Dr. Manjula supported me all the time and encouraged me for being positive.Even though i didnot get pains till the end and it is because of her it was a normal delivery and i delivered a healthy baby girl. she is so simple , understanding,clarifying your queries at any time , cheerful ,energetic and last but not the least very good dressing sense . She is the one i would recommend for everyone who is pregnant.This is one of the opportunities for me to show my gratitude to her. Thanks Doctor,if its not you i would have ended up in c-section.",

Although I did not have many complications with my pregnancy, Me and my husband were alone during the whole time, without any family members advise. In this situation, she was my go to person for any queries, and a word with her anytime was a reconciliation that me and the child was doing well. I highly highly recommend her   to all.

Docor Manjula also shares her personal mobile number for queries which is extremely helpful in cases of emergency. She is also very responsive to such texts. The best part is that she considers pregnancy as an organic process and makes the to-be parents very comfortable in the entire phase. She also ensures minimal visits/checkups to the hospital. She is polite, friendly and forever cheerful/energetic. We strongly believe that she will try her best for normal delivery. Ours was normal delivery.",

She is very connected to her patients.\nI had few ups and downs during my journey, where i had full support from the doctor. She explains the entire issue and provides viable solutions accordingly.

My wife delivered a baby in 2019 with Dr. Manjula deepak utmost care when we were in bangalore.\nDuring my wife's next pregnancy although we moved out from Bangalore to hosur because of Dr. Manjula Deepak visited Cloudnine HRBR. Dr took care this time as well with utmost care, we were worried about the baby position -Transverse lie till last scan. But Dr took care nicely and my wife delivered the baby c section in 2022.\n\nI very, very strongly recommend this Doctor to anyone, as we had a very difficult and successful and failed pregnancy journey before we met Dr. Manjula Deepak.\n\nThank you very much on behalf of myself and my whole family!!!\n\nWishing you to spread happiness in many more families by your profession, care and smile!!!",

She puts you at the forefront of everything and tells you what needs to be done.. She's super accessible and approachable outside of consultation, so you're always at ease. She helped us bring a beautiful baby girl through normal delivery and that's the biggest dream that she literally brought to life. I will always remember her for making this entire journey of ours so easy and precious.If you're looking for a doctor whose priority is not just your physical well being but also your mental well being, DR Manjula is the person for you.",

I was immediately referred to Endocrinologist and necessary medications were provided. She was always available for any query. Handled my high risk pregnancy so carefully. I strongly recommend Dr Manjula for all Gynaec matters.Pros : Explains issues and treatments  nicely, ensures patient is comfortable and informed, positive vibesCons: Waiting time during Weekend rush. Just ensure to book an appointment before going. ",

I delivered baby boy, normal delivery in her guidance and presence. I never thought I would be able to, however her belief on me was really appreciative. She has always been focused on my child and mine health during this 9 months. My husband and I were quite clear that we are in great hands. I do miss seeing her, because meeting her was a part of my regular routine and kind of boosted my morale too. ",

There's no doubt about her knowledge and experience in her field, she is great at what she does, and she has the ability to help bring out that confidence in you, because most often people tend to doubt a lot  during their pregnancy. My pregnancy wasn't very easy, I vomited a lot during the first four months, lost a lot of weight, and then I had to get a cervical cerclage done, I was so afraid the whole time. She always tried to boost my confidence, and answered all my questions. She is professional, yet friendly, and a trustworthy Doctor. I always believed that I am in safe hands, whenever I visited her, and that's so much important for a first tym mom (to be). So, this is a thank you note to her, for all she did, for the guidance she provided, and most importantly, for bringing our little one to this world - safe and sound, we will always feel grateful to you!! Thank you once again!!",

I highly recommend becoming her patient! \n\nWe are very fortunate that we met Doctor Manjula. She is like an guardian angel to us. we never met a doctor with such positive attitude, full of love and always smiling. You may find it strange but she remembers all her patient , this shows her generosity towards her patient. She guided me like a mother , taught me like a father and helped me like a friend. Everything was falling apart for us until we met Dr. Manjula. She showed us the correct path to follow. we are blessed with a baby last month which is not less than a miracle and the magician is none other than Dr. Manjula. ",

She is so friendly and explained us everything that we had in mind. Towards my 8th month scan we got to know that my fluid level was very low and doctor informed us that we need to take the baby out as soon as possible . She guided us to take the injection for baby\u2019s lung growth so once the baby is out, baby can come home with us rather than getting into New Born Intensive Care Unit. As per doctor\u2019s recommendation we went ahead with C-Section as the baby was in breach position, we are now blessed with a boy baby and he came home with us. \nThanks to Dr Manjula Deepak, she has been there with us throughout my pregnancy journey and helped me deliver my baby.",

She is always available even on whatsapp to answer any questions and worries that we have.  Even on the D-day(delivery day) Dr Manjula and her team made sure to be there for me every second and motivate me to have a normal delivery. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. \nI highly recommend visiting her for your pregnancy journey.

We have seen many doctors they say please wait outside even for small things but she is just treating all are same and treats us like medical students providing information on everything. ",

I went to her for my second pregnancy and from the day one I met her, I loved her energy, positivity, and the confidence she gave me. After having had a terrible experience with my first delivery and alot of post delivery complications, Dr. Manjula's expertise, compassion and dedication was very reassuring and encouraging in every visit we met her. She answered all my doubts wiping my fear away and only suggested the best for me.\n\nA humble soul and friendly doctor who addresses every patient name! Dr. Manjula is one of those rare doctors who fulfilled everything I had on my birth plan. I couldn't have been happier the way she delivered my baby boy. The best doctor I've come across and who re-instilled my trust in doctors again. Forever grateful to you, Dr. Manjula. ",

She is very friendly, highly energetic and provides detailed info on every single query of yours. But to be true, by the time is done detailing you on your reports, you won't be left with any queries of your own. She covers every single aspect and is always open about your reports and even complications (if any). We had a minor issue regarding AFI but she knew exactly what and how to handle and it all turned out absolutely fine. We are very happy to have opted for Manjula ma'am and would highly recommend her for pregnancy planning or delivery. ",

I was diagnosed with polyhydramnios(high fluid level) in 7th month and we never thought I can have normal delivery with that condition. She gave confidence and we are blessed with beautiful baby girl through normal delivery. we are really thankful to you mam.

The entire pregnancy journey has been great for me, one of the reasons being having a Doctor like Dr Manjula. Every appointment with Dr Manjula, she has given us the right recommendations to help with normal delivery. I did have a normal delivery (Aug 2021). Even during labor when I lost hope, her confidence, friendliness and her experience made the delivery easy and a memorable one for me. I would highly recommend her. ",

Straight in her words, doesn't lag the topic or any pregnancy related information. she makes you feel comfortable & consultations are usually stress free. She prescribes very less medicine & no unnecessary scan or consultation.  she remembers each & every patient's name, talks to every one with same enthusiasm. The only thing is, she is quite busy coz of her night shifts or the busy schedule & due to which few of our consultations were hurried up. I had ceserian for first & second baby too. for second baby we consulted Manjula ma'am & yes It was much better stress free compared to my first ceserian. This time I was able to get back to normal life within 3-4 days. The pain post delivery was also very less compared to my first ceserian.Overall a very friendly doctor with a good experience & knowledge. ",

Her knowledge and expertise made us comfortable from start to end.\n\nShe is very approachable and was available anytime we reached out to her.\n\nDespite having few complications, (gestational diabetes, negative Rh), she supported for normal delivery throughout our journey and always encouraged us for it.\n\nWith God's grace and her support, we delivered a bay girl normally.\n\n We are really grateful to her and would highly recommend for maternity journey.\n\n",

She is not just my gynecologist but much more than that, a caring sister and a good human being. Her words brought in lot of changes in me. I lost few kg's of weight and I was lot more relaxed than before. In just 2 months of our first visit I conceived again. Whole pregnancy journey was beautiful, even though we faced few challenges and surprises. In every visit she brought in lot of confidence and positive vibes in us. Now me and my husband are proud parents of a rainbow baby boy. We both are really greatful to Dr. Manjula and feel lucky that we met her.",

Had some health issues during my pregnancy, including high sugar levels and also a viral infection in my 7th month. With her advice was able to control my levels pretty. Her positive attitude and positive energy towards any of my health issues kept me positive, guided me well and I was able to deliver a healthy baby boy after carrying full term:) Recommend her highly as a well satisfied patient of hers!!",

Even from the first visit, the doctor was so friendly and caring that we did not feel we are meeting a new person. From day 1 of the visit, we felt we are in safe hands who encourages normal delivery. That\u2019s the confidence the doctor provides to both husband and wife. The one factor amongst many that we liked about the doctor is that she doesn\u2019t recommend unnecessary tests/scans/medications and she gives a lot of preference to the fitness, nutrition aspects of the mother. This kept us in check on the overall weight gain which was one of the reasons for achieving the normal delivery. We would heartily thank Dr Manjula Deepak for guiding us through our pregnancy journey and having a healthy baby!",

After meeting Dr Manjula, we realized that all the positive feedbacks shared about her is 100% true and we continued our regular consultation till the delivery. My wife was particular about normal delivery and doctor assisted and guided her at every stage and finally delivered the baby in a normal way. Dr. Manjula is friendly and never scares you of any problem and address the issue in most effective way. At the same time, never witnessed her recommending any unnecessary tests and really a patient friendly doctor. We are really happy with the Doctor and recommend her for everyone.\n\nManju & Asha",

She is friendly and more than that very professional. Easily approachable, I used to disturb her even in the middle of the nights asking questions and she replies immediately within 10 minutes. She prefers Normal delivery, My labor was lengthy I lost all the strength to have a normal delivery but Dr. Manjula did not give up she is very positive and that gave me the full confidence and strength to proceed without any complication. I am really thankful that I visited her.",

Good thing is I believe she lives nearby to the hospital.- She did her best and my wife too and my wife had normal delivery with both mother and baby are perfectly fine.",

Her continuous support and guidance helped my wife to deliver a healthy baby normally even with gestational diabetes. Not only she has taken great care of my wife's health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment ( Never hesistant to answer any of your questions ) It\u2019s rare to find a doctor with such Patience and courtesy and outstanding quality medical care. We are truly grateful to have consulted her and wishing her good health and happiness. May she continue to be the reason for  many healthy moms and happy babies.

She always gives her best to achieve the Normal Delivery from the beginning of the process. She has won our trust from the beginning, so we could say to our family members back in native that we are going for delivery in Bangalore itself, in-spite-of all their trials convincing us about many persons available for support in native.

I was very tensed during my pregnancy but her friendly and positive nature made me feel very comfortable in every visit\nWith God's grace we are now blesesed with little princess. \nIts very difficult to express our gratitude towards you with a small Thanks.

Always very friendly, positive and approachable, she would explain and answer all our questions and did not prescribe any unwanted medicines or scans. From the beginning she was always in favour of normal delivery. Even though I was scared and was ready for a C section, she ensured I had a hassle free normal delivery and took the right calls for me. Her chirpy & Happy nature, makes every hospital visit a pleasant experience. I would definitely recommend her for all pregnancy related consultations.",

Her friendly demeanor and positive outlook rubbed off on me and kept me in high spirits during this period. She also helped with all my queries and I am happy to say that I had quite a smooth and enjoyable pregnancy. Most importantly,  Dr Manjula Deepak did a great job with my c section surgery. I had to have a c section as I did not go into labour due to certain abnormalities. I am happy to say that I recovered from the surgery quite quickly and was up and about within 5 days of the surgery.",

I got pains in the midnight, manjula mam reached hospital very quickly and with her encouraged words and support, finally delivered a baby boy at 2.30 am in the morning.

Got to know about Manjula Deepak through Practo. She  seemed very friendly during our first  consultation .Amongst all the gynecologist  I visited during my first pregnancy( which were quite a few as I had to move across cities), I really felt the most comfortable with Dr.Manjula . I always preferred normal delivery which the doctor encouraged during my first visit without being mentioning about it , which I really appreciate. All I can conclude her as... a very practical and efficient doctor from my  experience and would really like to consider her supervision for my next pregnancy whenever that happens. She knows her job very well.",

Her nature is very friendly and we will be tension free once we meet and talk to her. All doubts were clearly explained.\nHer approach and treatment were really impressive. We would suggest her to any pregnant woman 100% without a second thought.\nOn Oct 8 I delivered a healthy baby girl through normal vaginal delivery.

I am blessed with baby boy .\nShe is an amazing person who is very approachable and clears all doubts and worries. Every consultation with her was happy time where she gives lot of advises on fitness, diet and confidence to sail on pregnancy. She always encourages for normal delivery.\nMy delivery got complicated at last moment and was decided to go for C section . As I was put on the OT table, Manjula mam checked me for one last time and said to team let's try normal delivery and yes she made it possible!!!.Though others in the room were skeptic about the decision, she was firm with her decision and encouraged me to push the baby. And I delivered healthy boy baby within minutes. \nI would recommend her to everyone as you won't be disappointed for sure . Now I miss meeting her :) Thank you once again mam :)",

She makes us very comfortable and address us like her family member. Even if it's a complicated or risky pregnancy, she never let us take that pressure instead builds confidence and help us go through happy and easy pregnancy. I completely believed doctor and has done only what she asked me to do and I worked all 9 months till my delivery.  We need not ask any queries instead doctor gives whole information about our situation before we ask. She knows exactly what is best for us. Our one and only job is to trust her and enjoy our pregnancy. Without any doubt I highly recommend her for everyone and wish them have a healthy and happy pregnancy. Thank you doctor for everything.",

We were really stressed and she gave us the confidence that everything is going to be okay!My wife had a low amniotic fluid level and Dr. Manjula suggested us to be induced in our 38th week. Baby's head was not yet engaged but however she had great expertise and patience and we had a safe normal delivery. We cannot thank Dr. Manjula enough for helping us welcome our baby safely. The trust and friendly relationship she establishes with all her patients is amazing. ",

Now came the most important part, who would be our doctor. After spending literally hours in reading reviews and research on the net, it was no doubt with Dr Manjula Deepak. Her positivity and energy makes one feel so comfortable and worry free. On July 1st she helped us deliver a beautiful baby boy through elective C-section. Elective because there were few unforeseen complications which Dr Manjula explained so professionally stating the protocols with both pros and cons, leaving it up to us to make the right decision. Everything went on smoothly because we knew we were in the right hands. \nTill this day my husband and I talk what if we had not made the move of meeting Dr Manjula. So thank you once again Doctor for looking after us and delivering our little prince safely. ",

I had decided to get my delivery done at home town due to other reasons. Though everything went well due to God's grace, I missed madam's services during delivery. Without any doubt when I went for my second delivery madam recognized me by name. She remembers everyone's name I guess. Any trouble, any pain, you see her smiling face, and your pain will no longer be there. She infuses lot of confidence. I had little complications during my 2nd one and madam always made me feel like there is no problem at all.Thank you madam :) ",

Manjula is a smile , as soon as you walk into her office she greets you with so much energy and positivity which is needed during a difficult time like pregnancy. She ensures she explains every scan detail and report to you, she is a true professional in her field and I would infact I have been recommending every one to go to her. Thank you dr.

In our 38th week scan, we found that the baby had 2 loops of cord around the neck. Baby weight was estimated to be 3.8 kgs. If there were any other doctor, they would have right away done a c-section. \n\nDr. Manjula told us that she'd try to deliver the baby naturally but will not rule out emergency c section, should there be a problem with baby's oxygen levels. She suggested us not to wait for natural labor pains to start (which could go up to week 40), by when baby's weight could increase to up to 4 kgs. She induced labor and we were able to deliver the baby naturally without an epidural. Can't thank Dr. Manjula enough for being so patient with us and not scaring us with the usual last minute emergency c-section that other doctors do. Highly recommend her, especially for those seeing normal deliveries. ",

She insists and tries her level best for normal delivery. It was only because of her I delivered baby normally. My intial trimester was horrible I had consulted at least 4-5 doctors and was finally satisfied with her, I felt her to be very friendly with patients, you won't feel you are visiting a doctor. I must say she is lady of ethics as well, as a token of thanks we tried to offer her gifts but she politely refused. If you are looking for a friendly doctor, who insists on normal delivery and is always ready to respond to your call and messages,  without giving second thought just go for her. ",

She is the doctor who encouraged us to try for a normal delivery.  I can still vividly imagine how I was so scared in the OT and when she came into the OT, I had the courage to go for a normal delivery. She is someone who is really positive and changes the vibe of the hospital once she is around. She is super responsive on WhatsApp and always responded back to the most basic questions that I had during my pregnancy. She also advised me to go for natural remedies instead of recommending pills and tablets, and I really liked that approach. Thank you so much Dr. Manjula for everything. ",

It was very encouraging to see that she targets normal delivery and guides with diet/exercise for the same. She also recommends homely herbs for general pregnancy issues instead of buying medicines from pharmacy.\nShe explains in detail all that comes out in reports and scans and very patient enough to listen to our doubts. We were very happy that we chose her. \nThanks Doctor for taking care of me !!!!",

She always encouraged me to do regular exercise for normal delivery as well as to maintain my weight. She patiently explained each and every thing we need to know during pregnancy . She cleared each and every doubt whatever we had. My husband always says god sent us to her as we were totally unaware about were to go and what to except . She is really a wonderful doctor and a wonderful person. Only thing u need to do is listen to her and follow what she says and everything will be in it\u2019s right place. ",

She is compassionate, thoughtful, dedicated to providing the best care. The months leading up to the big day were full of questions and concerns, but were handled so well by her. Her calm demeanor, positive and vibrant aura helped create a tranquil environment during this once in a lifetime event. We will always be grateful for the excellent care provided by the doctor. God bless you abundantly. Thank you for making this experience a wonderful one! :) \nWith love n regards, \nAbi & Praveen",

Every time i had an appointment with her , i used to come out of the hospital with more positivity and confidence.  i really miss meeting her after my delivery. Her witty and very jovial nature is what I miss. I used to be in awe of her energy as doctor always has a lot of patients waiting for her and she never fails to greet everyone with her beautiful smile. Every greatful to her as i delivered a beautiful baby girl . Doctor tried her best for vaginal delivery , but as i has GD and the babys head was not getting fixed , i opted for a C sec after 10 hrs in labour. She will make you feel very comfortable and guide you in the best way possible with simple diet and exercise. Thank you doctor for being with me during my pregnancy. I wish everyone gets someone like dr.manjula for their pregnancy.",

This is  my first pregnancy and I am very happy and thankful  that I consulted Dr. Manjula, her positive attitude and the way she boosts our confidence and makes us feel secure is one amazing thing. She has a solution to all our concerns. A humble human being which is a perfect quality for a doctor. She has been available to us all through the pregnancy guiding us in the right way even with the smallest concern or issue and made sure I had a normal delivery inspite of  having a fibroid.We are blessed to have you in our life Dr , thank you from the bottom of our heart for everything. You are truly an angel to us :-*\nREGARDS\nSNEHA KUDIGE",

I was tired and tense towards the end of my labour, but as soon as she entered the room, with just a few words and a smile, she made me feel freshly energized and capable and made the whole thing so much easier! \n\nThank you, Dr. Manjula for being an amazing doctor and an amazing person and for helping me bring a healthy, happy baby into the world!

Then my sister recommended Dr. Manjula Deepak, So we took appointment for the Pregnancy check up. In the very first meeting she made us feel very comfortable, gave us the confidence and hope that we desperately needed at that point of time . From then on wards she was always there for us when needed to clarify our queries and doubts. We were able to reach her anytime through whatsapp. On June 23rd  my wife delivered our 2nd baby and we all are very Happy.  Me and my wife (Anupama Kaligatla) are Thankful to Dr Manjula Deepak for the pleasant experience. We Strongly recommend this doctor for everyone. she is really amazing lady and did magic with her words in each and every consultation.",

All these while she has been very friendly, approachable and responsible. The best part was the way she explained every scan and reports. She used to clarify all the doubts with lots of patience. She is prompt in replying to the message queries.  She would always remember your case in details even if you visit her after a month or so. All the while till the last day she encouraged me to go for normal delivery however as I was sceptical for normal delivery, so had C-section delivery. She is responsible and would not take even 1% chance on anything. She always goes extra mile to ensure safety for you and your baby, even which means working on non-working days. I always had that trust that I was in the safe hands under her.",

In these last 9 months, that has never been a single dull moment (consultation, scans or delivery) with her. She is always available on WhatsApp and responds patiently to the silliest question you might have.\n\nI am just so glad that I delivered my Princess - Myra in her hands. Believe If there was a Dr. Manjula Deepak Fan club , I would be the first one to join :). \n\nOur little Angel is 4 weeks old today and my entire family is extremely grateful and thankful to Dr. Manjula.\n\nPooja, Kunal & my princess Myra",

And for any emergency she was always available on phone. On the delivery day, i had no hope that i would deliver normal. I requested her to do Cesarean, She encouraged me so much to go for normal delivery. And i delivered normally. i recovered with in 1 week. My husband who wasn't trusting blore doctors earlier, now considers Dr Manjula nothing less than God. Manjula Mam will be one of the unforgettable person in my life. I am so great full to you Mam.

Firstly, I want to thank my friend for suggesting an amazing person like Dr Manjula. \n\nAs everyone, I also had n number of doubts and anxiety about my pregnancy journey. But after my first consultation with her, I decided to continue my treatment and delivery in Bangalore itself rather than going to native. For me she is an energy booster and in every visit she was very detail about my health progress which definitely boosted up my confidence level. I always felt positive after every visit. One other quality is that she always remembers each and every details of her patients. Also, she is available always on phone or whtsapp. As a doctor and as a genuine human being I admire her a lot.  \nWe strongly recommend Dr Manjula Deepak.\n",

Her integrity is impeccable and she doesn\u2019t prescribe any medications/scans or any other intrusive procedures unless absolutely required. She keeps herself updated with latest medical studies and advances which gives her an edge over most other doctors. In my case, she successfully avoided an intrusive procedure (recommended by all other doctors) just by putting me on some specific medications. Very thankful for that. She is also very responsive to messages/calls and responds to all queries patiently. I highly recommend her.",

Every time we visited her, she filled new energy and optimism in us. Always available to clarify every single doubt we had. With series of deliveries and consultations lined up every day, she never looks exhausted. Super active and filled with joy, which makes the patient, family members and everyone around her enjoy every moment spent. Most impressive of all was understanding the issues of patient and treating medically and emotionally. Also, the way family was engaged to feel the magical movements on every visit is highly appreciable. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks for her exceptional care. Thank you so much for the difference you make in the lives of your patients and their families. God bless you and your family.",

She always listens to concerns or queries patiently. It is really surprising that she remembers evey patients name and history without seeing their file which gives confidence and trust in her. She is very particular about exercising and aims for normal delivery. In my case due to multiple reasons we were left with cesarian section for which I was very much scared. But she explained what she will do and ensured that my fear is gone and delivered a beautiful boy baby. If at all she was not there, not sure how i would have managed my pregnancy and delivery .Thanks a lot doctor for your care and love towards us.",

I could not resist myself to sign up to practo just for reviewing overall experience with Dr Manjula Ma'am . 100% satisfaction is very well justified. From conceiving till delivery the propitious face of manjula deepak is the most comforting with every visit. Dr. Manjula was always available  even at time we needed the doctors advice at midnight. and that kept us cheerful . And rightly said a cheerful wife is spice of life. Even the delivery room was stress free under her supervision . My wife had a normal delivery on 11th Aprill. Thank you Dr. Manjula.\nThat said about the doctor , the nurses contribution are priceless. We sincerely thank all nurses who comforted us selflessly. ",

Our baby was in breach presentation. She guided us all along from then. She very positive in her approach, at the same time she gives timely professional advice. She had to cancel her visit to sister place, because my wife due was nearing. This demonstrates her commitment to the patients. Actually my wife scheduled to c section on 20th December 2017. Dr Manjula checked the position of the baby minutes before delivery. Lucky the baby had come head down position. So the doctor advised us not to proceed with c section and their is  chance for normal delivery. Latter due high amenoatic fluid the baby was moving so much. Finally my wife delivered on 29th December 2017. We are very much satisfied with Dr Manjula Deepak. I would recommend her every one. She is very professional and positive Doctor. *** *** *** **** ******** ",

But trust me she has great memory she will remember everything you say\ud83d\ude02 and you will feel that in every next visit when she ask questions related to previous visit. \nI can keep on writing but let me keep it short\u2764\ufe0f\n\nI was begging for C-section during labour pain because I was not able to take the pain. I told Manjula Deepak to do C-section and she said okay just for my mental peace. But at the end she did Normal Delivery.  I\u2019m reviewing her after months  because now I know she is the one Doctor I\u2019ll trust my whole life. My husband always says she is our family doctor .  I like her so much that sometimes I feel like I should just pay consultation fee and meet her but then I feel I should not take another pat person time who is waiting to see Dr. Manjula Deepak.",

With lots of patience without suggesting unnecessary medicine she treated me. She always suggests  to reduce stress. That really worked for us to become parents to our lil baby girl. Manju mam is like our own cousin sister, she gave such a free space to share everything without hesitation.I like the way she communicates to patients in a very friendly manner. I found her as a Gem of a person.Her energy & commitment to work is commendable. Indeed she is an inspiring woman to society.When I got convinced after waiting for 2 years she guided me throughout my pregnancy journey with very minimal medications. She always suggested that you be normal and enjoy your pregnancy journey. My delivery was also very smooth without complications. Thanks to Mam & Cloudnine staff for all the treatment,care & love she showered on me & my lil one. I highly recommend her, *** ** *** ** *** **** ************* ** ********** Lots of love from 3 of us to you Manju mam. Thanks,Navya & Gowtham",

Thank you for bringing our Little Prince to land.My child is very fortunate to have been born through your hands. Thank you for all the support and care,Dr Manjula Deepak\n\nWe were looking for the best gynaecologist near Horamavu when we planned for the baby. Then we came to know about Dr Manjula Deepak at Cloud Nine ,HRBR. Before that we visited 2 more doctors  but we weren't satisfied.\nWe just admired her in just one consultation. She is very friendly, calm and sympathetic when we explain our problems then give the right suggestions.\n\nWe followed the madam advice properly then we got a healthy result.\n\nAt 35th week we knew that the weight and height of the baby was 300 grams more than the calculated weight through the ultrasound scan. Then Manju mam explained the possibility of delivery considering the growth of the baby.  We blessed a healthy baby boy through C- Section. He weighs 3.5 kg.\n\n We'll never forget her support and kindness. \n\n@Dr Deepika(asst of Dr Manjula Deepak):Thank you for such a wonderful contribution\n\nAnd also thanks for the staff's support and their friendliness .\n\n\n\nWith so much of love from Vandan and Chetan",

I previously had a miscarriage so I was very worried this time.. each and every time I asked her if everything was alright she just said be bold this is my baby don't worry everything is fine.. we delivered the baby on 27th of October.. our dream came true because of you doctor.. we are a family now because of you doctor.. Dr. you are a gem of a person and we love you and ask God to always keep you and ur family safe and secure.. thank you for all the treatment and all the love you showed us throughout our pregnancy journey.. just this thank you would not be enough I would say.. but doctor we wish you all success and blessings always for you and ur family.. with love Raj and Anu(Ann Mary)",

I always looked forward to monthly consultations with her. such a positive soul and delivers what she promises. she listens to all the concerns and addresses them even if they are silly. she's available 24/7 to her patients even through what's app and I sometimes doubt if she ever sleeps and gets any personal time for herself? I wish could write more but am short of words. I just love her and miss consultations with her :(",

She examines the patient with utmost care and professionalism. She seems to be an expert in her field and may be that's why she was able to satisfy our queries with full confidence and by highlighting all the pros and cons of the entire ups and downs in a women's pregnancy phase. I remember one time when I was in my 8th month and had her appointment fixed for a particular date and time; I had to wait for an hour or so to meet her, at that time was fumed with anger and was getting crankier by the minute as I hadn't eaten my breakfast ('must for everyone especially for the pregnant ladies), but the moment she stepped in the clinic with a big smile and an apologetic 'sorry' all my anger and impatientness went 'kaput',later she told me that she had to attend an emergency case which was the sole reason for her delay, which was totally understandable considering her profession. \nWhile I was in the OT for C-Sec Dr.Manjula was the one who comforted me and I guess that's the reason why my B.P. was normal all through out. Thank you Dr.Manjula you've been the best so.  \nRegards, \nPrerna & Rahul Chettri",

She is such a charm and spread only positive vibes.I got recommended by my cousin who is Doctor Manjula Deepak's colleague. I thank her for recommending *** **** ******* so friendly so kind and what not. Keshav and I were so confident because we were under the guidance of such a blissful doctor. You do great jobs doctor, you be the 2nd mother of many women. You seek their blessings, you send them home so happily and that gives so much satisfaction to you. Hats off to you doctor. Keshav and I reccomend you to every of our friends and family who are planning for pregnancy. We both owe our entire life for getting delivered under your guidance.

Going through my first pregnancy in this pandemic situation,I was really tensed.  But after talking to her I felt relieved and I knew I was in safe hands. She made me feel at ease throughout the entire duration of my pregnancy and delivery. Always been very responsive to all my queries. Never advise any test or medicine unnecessarily and always recommends natural remedies . She helped me to have a normal delivery and bring my beautiful baby to the world. I will be forever grateful for that. \n\nAlways be thankful for her excellent knowledge, outstanding support and amazing friendly nature. Thank you doctor once again. *** *** *** ******* ********I highly recommend her to all expecting parents.\n\nThank you,\nSaby and Sujit",

The moment my wife met her she decided to get her delivery from doctor manjula only.We met 4 doctors before mam but we did not get this confidence anywhere.The entire time during pregnancy everyone thinks about the moment when you can finally hold the baby. Whether you will reach hospital on time, whether doctor will be available and things would go smooth.In our case we had to reach the hospital at 12:00 AM in emergency, while leaving from home I just pinged the doctor on whatsapp that there is an emergency and we will be reaching hospital in sometime. We were scared and this is Corona times so no help from relatives/family/friends.Manjula mam not only reached hospital before us, she took my wife in Operation theatre without wasting anytime. She called me three times while I was taking my wife to hospital. No doctor does that.We were blessed with a healthy baby and my wife was absolutely fine.I sincerely feel that we got our baby because of doctor manjula. She told me later that it was her 6th delivery of that day.She is an inspiration to everyone, the way she talks to the patient, the confidence she gives to expecting parents. I strongly recommend her for all the expecting parents.thankyou doctor manjula.",

Mam answers all the questions patiently and always smiles. She gives so much positivity that the full journey becomes very easy.\n\nWe faced two complications from starting of third month of pregnancy. First, Bleeding in third month which scared us but Mam not only handled it very carefully but also gave us confidence that everything will be fine. And we made through this phase successfully.\n\nSecond, In seventh month of pregnancy there was severe itching in whole body. We met with Mam regarding this issue. After LFT, it was found that it was ICP issue. Mam advised medication and repeat tests for the same and fortunately, ICP was in control till delivery.\n\nManjula mam shared her personal contact number with us through which we could get help whenever it was needed. She made our journey very comfortable.\n\nBecause of ICP issue, Mam took the decision to deliver the baby a bit earlier and made us understand the whole situation. It feels good when someone takes a job in a very responsible manner and she is one of them.\n\nFinally, the Day came on 11-05-2018. It was normal delivery even after so many complications and all credit goes to Manjula Mam. We are very thankful for her support throughout. \u270c\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffb",

I have reason to say this, as I conceived with great difficulties in IVF treatment, selecting a good gynecologist was challenging for me, so I visited so many reputated hospitals and top reviewed doctors but they all scared me telling so many procedures, blood tests, injections and page full of tablets to follow up till my delivery. But finally  the only Doctor Who prescribed 3 tablets per day and said everything is normal was Dr. Manjula Deepak. Each visit with doctor was happy movement for us, she makes even complicated, as simple one with her smiling face and brings confidence with her patients. So finally \nManjula ma'am gave us a healthy girl baby without any complications in our journey. Just a thanks is not enough for your service and wordings are not enough to express. In this modern era this kind of doctor is very rare so cloudnine hospital is blessed to have Dr. Manjula ma'am. ",

We thought of taking second opinion because with little googling we did we knew second pregnancy  rarely becomes ectopic..Looking  at Practo reviews we decided to visit Dr.Manjula.. In the first visit itself she gave so much confidence to us that we will have a healthy baby after observing the first scan. *** ********** ***** ********* *** managed entire journey very smooth..Never prescribed unnecessary test or scans..Not seen such a honest and sincere doctor always enthusiastic  and dedicated ..Always accessible in WhatsApp for any queries and suggests home remedy many a times for any pregnancy related illness. Surprisingly she remembers names of almost every patient who visits her .That is the kind of human touch she brings..She tried her best to achieve normal delivery through few exercises..But due to other small problems we had to go for c-section but a very healthy baby girl delivered. Mother and baby got discharged in 2.5 days..our sincere thanks to Dr.Manjula Deepak for making this journey joyful..Wishing her continued  great success .Ashwini and Ananth",

She strongly insists on progressing naturally for things and By God\u2019s ultimate Grace and Dr Manjula Deepak\u2019s presence I delivered a healthy and a beautiful baby boy. Other duty doctors and nurses were so comforting and motivating me during the labor. It\u2019s the most mesmerizing experience of my life to see your own creation coming out of you. I and my husband will always remember and grateful to Dr Manjula Deepak.\nI strongly recommend Dr Manjula Deepak to my friends, relatives and other expectant mothers.\nThank you Doctor for a great experience.\nShridhanya and Sam\n",

We wanted normal delivery at any cost, to avoid future complications because of my overweight and health issues.\nWe consulted many doctors for normal delivery, but many of them rejected the possibilities of normal delivery. Dr. Manjula Deepak on the other hand had encouraged me that there are chances. She inculcated much positive spirit which was most needed in that gloomy time of the pandemic. She suggested basic exercises, which I followed without fail. Also thanks to the diabetologist Dr. Lakshmi Vinutha. Finally delivered a baby boy normally.",

I love the fact that she is honest. I had gestational diabetes  but she handled this situation like a pro :) She made me understand why it was important for me to keep my sugar in check and how I could do that. She builds trust and that's why I will recommend Manjula (CloudNine) to all my friends and family. I had a normal delivery and she guided me all the way...she recommended me the exercises I can do to ensure I deliver normally. She was available any time (by that I mean ANYTIME :)).

Doctor waited long hours and did normal delivery around 3PM, that day Dr.Manjula's father not feeling well.

I had a rocky pregnancy but Dr Deepak made my process smooth and put all our worries to rest and now I have a healthy 14 day old daughter through normal delivery. The best part was I was not put on dozens of medicines, just what was required. My husband and I are immensely thankful for choosing her and we recommend the same to any and every new parents to be. Lastly a huge thanks to Dr. Deepak for being the best guide/mentor/Doctor in this wonderful journey. Definitely going back to her for my second child.",

She has a very charmistic personallity with full of energy and positive attitude. She is such a great human being besides her professional career. She is very humble, caring, confident and very friendly in nature. In our first visit we had a lot of questions and to our surprise we got answers for all of them without asking. This shows her extensive knowledge and passion towards her work. We always got that positive vibes everytime we visited her. She makes sure her patients are comfortable and eases everything with a bright smile on her face. She patiently listens to her patients and clears all the doubts and queries. We will never forget those moments and experiences in my lifetime. I highly recommend Dr. Manjula for the way she guides her patients throughout the journey. Thank you doctor for your support.

She exhibits a lot of passion and dedication. She successfully put her best efforts to avoid cesarian delivery even though my wife was medically at high risk of cesarian delivery. My wife had polyhydroaminose and all my previous doctors were scaring us about preterm delivery at 6 month. Later on when I approached Dr Manjula, we were greatly relieved and calmed. She smartly handled this case and eventually helped us achieve our dream goal of normal delivery. Also she amazingly remembers each and every minute past medical details of my wife everytime we went for OPD. During entire pregnancy she was very prompt on WhatsApp replying for any doubts within 2 minutes even at 12 midnight! She is an amazingly skilled social worker always willing to dedicate maximum time and energy towards her patients. Doctors like her are a blessing for our country.",

Thanks to Practo for all the wonderful reviews, without a second thought, we decided to go with this doctor for our first baby.Words do not do justice for all that Manjula maa'm is. We found Manjula maa'm to be extremely friendly, highly energetic and positive person. Throughout the pregnancy, we felt extremely confident and happy under her treatment. We had a normal delivery of our baby, thanks to Manjula maa'm. Simple tips suggested by her during the treatment were extremely helpful. She is someone who doesn't miss any minute detail and keeps the patient at ease. Each visit to this doctor has been extremely satisfying and filled us with great positivity. Manjula maa'm is more than a doctor. She's a wonderful great human. Thankyou Maa'm for all that you are. Wishing you the Best,- Rajitha and Vamshi",

Dr. Manjula tried her best for my normal delivery , despite my water breaking. But when we needed to rush for an emergency c-sec, she was quick on her toes and readied her team in no time. Thanks to her, I delivered a healthy baby.\nDuring my post-delivery stay at the hospital, she visited me every day. Even if she was getting late in the evening/night, she would not leave without meeting me. Her smile and comforting words made a lot of difference to my recovery. ",

My wife had few issues in pregnancy but Manjula mam will never allow us to think negative about any issues. She made normal delivery possible for my wife which we thought that will never happen. She handled each and every situation of my wife during pregnancy very carefully and she answers all our questions very patiently and positively.. Even post delivery  she takes care well.. I had lot to say but it goes big here. On the whole I strongly recommend Dr.Manjula Deepak mam for pregnancy related treatments because every girl dreams about having such kind ,friendly, positive minded doctor only.. 200%  satisfied and we wanted to say big big thanks to her...

She used to treat patients like family. As my first pregnancy was c section, I was not sure whether I can make this as vbac but due to my fluid level I was supposed to go for c section again. Manjula mam again gave us full of positive vibes. And We are blessed with boy baby now. Personally I would recommend everyone to have a consultation with her.",

She has a knack of getting comfortable with the patient and is super approachable. \nThe best part about Manjula ma'am is that she anticipates our questions and answer them to our satisfaction. \n\nOn 23rd July, my wife Sanjana has a normal delivery and we were blessed with a baby boy. \nI and Sanjana sincerely thank Manjula ma'am for a seamless and peaceful 9 months of pregnancy and delivery. Wishing all the happiness to ma'am and her family. \n",

She is a positive soul with a beautiful smile.She is humble, energetic,extremely down to earth, very caring and friendly person.First Visit at cloudnine was smooth and quick. She spoke to us very kindly and explained briefly about further steps. We liked the way she communicated and explained things to us. We decided to continue to consult her. And we do not regret even for a second. She was very cooperative supportive humble kind (and many more adverbs we can describe her with \ud83d\ude0a) All throughout the 9months of pregnancy she was anytime available on Whatsapp and was supportive in every aspect.",

She suggested us for scanning only twice in the entire pregnancy. She will remember you entire medical record till the end of the procedure. \nMe and my husband are very happy with Manjula Mam and we will always be thankful to her for making the entire pregnancy process simple and safe. If you are close by to this area or even willing to travel for a good doctor then Dr.Manjula Deepak is the right person for you..\nThank you Doctor for making it simple and safe even though my age is 36.

In this journey presence of a wonderful doctor is simply priceless. \nWe (Akanksha & Sunil Katyal) would like to thank Dr. Manjula for the exceptional patience and professionalism that she has shown during the birth of our angel. I am proud to have an amazing doctor like her in my life. She is a remarkable doctor who takes out all your stress. Thank you for everything you have done to safely deliver our baby.\n\nFROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEART, THANK YOU. ",

We are from Chennai and consulted Dr. Manjula from my 7th month of pregnancy by my Dad's suggestion. Initially I was very nervous about how my journey is gonna continue in Bangalore from Chennai. But to be frank I was overwhelmed after talking to her, I was consulting a Govt. Dean in our area at Chennai for 6 months but wasn't this comfortable or cool. Once we met our doctor, my family and myself gained more confidence and was happy because she preferred natural home remedies, exercises, explained everything before I could question her. She is friendly and very enthusiastic with positive vibes. Most importantly she was always available through whatsapp or calls. I felt blessed when I delivered my Princess in her hands. We strongly recommend our Rock Star Dr. Manjula Deepak, love you mam!!! gonna raise up our Princess just like you!! ",

She really takes care of all necessary precautions and monitors the pregnancy from start to end. She is also the most accessible doctor we have ever seen. Any point of time in a day you send her a message with your question, she will always respond. After 3 miscarriages, we went to Manjula Deepak and today we are blessed twin healthy girls. We really miss interacting with her now. We wish and pray for all good health, ever lasting energy and cheerfulness. Thank you Doctor!  Please don't forget our personalized reply :-)",

In my case 2 rounds of umbilical cord was surrounded over babies neck where there were chances for c-section but Dr.\nDeepak made it an easy normal delivery. The best thing was she is always available over phones and explains everything in detailed manner for any solution. She doesn\u2019t suggest unnecessary medications and scans which will both effect mother and baby. She gives all natural home remedies to overcome any pregnancy problems.i would have rated her more than 5 stars if i had a option too!!! Thank you mam for all your support and help. Where ever your gods blessings should always be there for you and your family.",

I'm so glad I followed her advice of keeping myself active with regular walking routine and kegels. \n\n Very energetic person, she lightens up your mood so instantly that you forget all your doubts..haha.... Nevertheless she clarifies all your doubts even before you could ask for. To sum up, every check-up would be like a mini stress buster session for me.\n\n She a God sent Angel for guiding me and taking me thought-out pregnancy till the labour.

The way she caring a patients situation is too good.  My first baby was aborted, she done DNC and gave a health advice which made me really feel better. As she promised I followed mam's advice, now gave birth to a baby girl. \n         We like her the way of approaching patient and their family members, treatment, advice. The way she interacted gave us a confident. We faced both situations DNC and delivery with mam. Rather than the doctor she is very caring person. \n          And I definitely suggest my friends and relatives about mam. She mostly tries for normal delivery, if their is no possibility then only C section. Mam's goals is to get the baby and mom safer.  Main reason is she won't threaten about the delivery complication. Thanks for giving us cute baby and happy mom back. ",
