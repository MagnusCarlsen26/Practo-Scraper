We were so pleasantly amazed at her immense patience for answering the long list of questions and doubts that we had. In each and every visit, she made sure of prodding us to ask all our doubts and share all our concerns. She repeatedly asked \"what else\" to ensure that we left her cabin only after asking evey single thing that might have been bothering us. She is so approachable that we never hesitated from asking even the silliest of questions. She also shared her email ID and her number towards the end to ensure that we can reach out in case of anything urgent or just to clarify any doubts or seek reassurance. She was always so prompt in responding to our queries that it further helped reduce our anxiety, knowing that help is just a text away.\nDuring pregnancy, when things seem so uncertain and confusing, having someone to provide reassurance, explain things and lend a sympathetic ear is something for which we can't be grateful enough. \nFrom the first day, Dr. Sneha made sure that my husband was treated as an equal partner in this journey, and was not made to feel excluded at all. This is something that is still not a norm sadly. We were really relieved at her approach as it was really important for us to share the experience and be there for each other every step of the way.\nDr. Sneha never made us feel like we were just another patient, she would always remember our names and would greet us like a friend. \nMy pregnancy was a high risk case and there were a lot of complications. Dr. Sneha deftly handled all the issues and was really quick in identifying and addressing the concerns. Because of her quick decision making we were able to avoid adverse effects of a complication that I developed in the 37th week. \nShe also tried her best to ensure that we could go for a vaginal delivery, only when it was no longer feasible because of the complications, she counselled us to consider a planned c-section. \nThe actual day of the delivery, the experience was beyond anything I could have imagined. Dr. Sneha allowed my husband to be there in the OT during the c-section, holding my hands as we welcomed our baby in this world. I can't express in words how much that helped soothe my nerves and helped me overcome all the fear and anxiety that I had before the surgery. The experience was further enhanced as our baby was brought into the world to the tunes of soulful songs that ma'am was playing during the operation. I can't believe that even I was singing along during the operation, ma'am was so happy when she noticed me singing! I still get amazed that I was having a discussion with her regarding the movie that a particular song belonged to during my c-section! \nPost the procedure as well, ma'am took a lot of care to ensure that I was completely recovered and there wasn't any discomfort or potential issue remaining unidentified and unaddressed. She was also there during the discharge to participate in the cake cutting ceremony. She truly helped us feel cared for and this didn't feel like just a professional relationship but a cherished relationship built on care, trust and respect. Thanks a lot ma'am for making our journey so beautiful despite the multiple bumps that we encountered on the way.",

                "review_text": "We flew in from the  UK to give birth to our child in India at week 32 of our pregnancy.  Before we came to Bengaluru, we did a few checks on doctors and decided that we were to meet her. We have to say that it was probably the best decision we have ever made to choose Dr. Sneha.\nAt our first appointment, she waited for us close to 20 minutes without any fuss as we were running late and within the first 15 minutes of talking to her we knew that she was going to be our doctor on our pregnancy journey hereafter.  We did visit another doctor, who we absolutely did not like, after we spoke to Dr. Sneha but we very well knew who we were going for in our journey. \nDr. Sneha patiently listened to everything that we had to say for 45 minutes at our first appointment before talking about her perspective. That is very commendable. \nOn all our subsequent appointments, we spoke about the journey and everything else very casually, shared a bit of humour and fun to take the stress away of the impending birth for us. It was quite refreshing for both the doctor and for ourselves. \nThere was no unnecessary advice, pointless checks or tests and her dedication to do a normal delivery is something I have not heard about much in India. She recommended a handful of very useful things for us and explained clearly why she was doing so. We saw the results of that rather quickly. \nNot only was she our doctor, she is also very dear to us because of her charisma, friendliness  and impeccable character. She ensured that both of us were not stressed in any way throughout our checkups and also on the day of birth. \nWhen my partner went into active labour suddenly, she was constantly reachable and ensured that everything proceeded on her instructions despite her not immediately being there. \nTo give a snippet of our day of labour, Dr. Sneha met with an accident while on the way to to the hospital to deal with us. Despite that, she got herself to the labour room with a properly bruised shin, limping because she wanted to somehow deliver our child. She continuously worked for 6 hours straight and did everything she could possibly do to give birth to our son vaginally. \nShe had already accepted our birth plan in a very reasonable manner and was very open about me being beside my partner during the birth. She was very clear, early on, on what was possible and what wasn't during the procedure. \nNo other doctor, I'm sure, would have done that because the baby had pooped quite a bit of meconium (Grade III) and it was meant to be a classic case of an emergency C section. \nDr. Sneha was very clear that as long as the fetal heart rate did not drop, she was going to do everything in her power to do a natural birth. There were various complications like the cord being wrapped around the baby's head and the baby being much bigger than expected. \nNot only she took care of the birth  so well but also my partner after strenuous labour. She checked on us frequently during our stay in the hospital and ensured that we felt comfortable and were clear on the recovery stages. \nI cannot recommend her enough for any pregnancy or birth related consultations irrespective of where you are located in Bengaluru. \nThank you Dr. Sneha for helping us with the mental strength to get through what was a very tough birth for my partner. \n",

We could reach her any time in case of emergency or concerning events, for a first-time expecting couple even small things become big worries, but she was always there for us.\nIn first trimester we faced complexity of sub-chronic bleeding, but it was well treated by her guidance and medication. \nIt was not an easy journey, but we knew that our baby was in good hands.\nWe had normal delivery, but it wasn\u2019t an easy one. Our Baby weight was on higher side with umbilical cord looped tightly around the neck. The go to solution was cesarean, but Dr. Sneha inspired positivity and gave us an option of normal delivery. \nThis was a big decision for us, the trust and confidence on Dr. Sneha made us opt for the normal delivery.\nA BIG THANKS TO DR.

We were so pleasantly amazed at her immense patience for answering the long list of questions and doubts that we had. In each and every visit, she made sure of prodding us to ask all our doubts and share all our concerns. She repeatedly asked \"what else\" to ensure that we left her cabin only after asking evey single thing that might have been bothering us. She is so approachable that we never hesitated from asking even the silliest of questions. She also shared her email ID and her number towards the end to ensure that we can reach out in case of anything urgent or just to clarify any doubts or seek reassurance. She was always so prompt in responding to our queries that it further helped reduce our anxiety, knowing that help is just a text away.\nDuring pregnancy, when things seem so uncertain and confusing, having someone to provide reassurance, explain things and lend a sympathetic ear is something for which we can't be grateful enough. \nFrom the first day, Dr. Sneha made sure that my husband was treated as an equal partner in this journey, and was not made to feel excluded at all. This is something that is still not a norm sadly. We were really relieved at her approach as it was really important for us to share the experience and be there for each other every step of the way.\nDr. Sneha never made us feel like we were just another patient, she would always remember our names and would greet us like a friend. \nMy pregnancy was a high risk case and there were a lot of complications. Dr. Sneha deftly handled all the issues and was really quick in identifying and addressing the concerns. Because of her quick decision making we were able to avoid adverse effects of a complication that I developed in the 37th week. \nShe also tried her best to ensure that we could go for a vaginal delivery, only when it was no longer feasible because of the complications, she counselled us to consider a planned c-section. \nThe actual day of the delivery, the experience was beyond anything I could have imagined. Dr. Sneha allowed my husband to be there in the OT during the c-section, holding my hands as we welcomed our baby in this world. I can't express in words how much that helped soothe my nerves and helped me overcome all the fear and anxiety that I had before the surgery. The experience was further enhanced as our baby was brought into the world to the tunes of soulful songs that ma'am was playing during the operation. I can't believe that even I was singing along during the operation, ma'am was so happy when she noticed me singing! I still get amazed that I was having a discussion with her regarding the movie that a particular song belonged to during my c-section! \nPost the procedure as well, ma'am took a lot of care to ensure that I was completely recovered and there wasn't any discomfort or potential issue remaining unidentified and unaddressed. She was also there during the discharge to participate in the cake cutting ceremony. She truly helped us feel cared for and this didn't feel like just a professional relationship but a cherished relationship built on care, trust and respect. Thanks a lot ma'am for making our journey so beautiful despite the multiple bumps that we encountered on the way.",

                "review_text": "We flew in from the  UK to give birth to our child in India at week 32 of our pregnancy.  Before we came to Bengaluru, we did a few checks on doctors and decided that we were to meet her. We have to say that it was probably the best decision we have ever made to choose Dr. Sneha.\nAt our first appointment, she waited for us close to 20 minutes without any fuss as we were running late and within the first 15 minutes of talking to her we knew that she was going to be our doctor on our pregnancy journey hereafter.  We did visit another doctor, who we absolutely did not like, after we spoke to Dr. Sneha but we very well knew who we were going for in our journey. \nDr. Sneha patiently listened to everything that we had to say for 45 minutes at our first appointment before talking about her perspective. That is very commendable. \nOn all our subsequent appointments, we spoke about the journey and everything else very casually, shared a bit of humour and fun to take the stress away of the impending birth for us. It was quite refreshing for both the doctor and for ourselves. \nThere was no unnecessary advice, pointless checks or tests and her dedication to do a normal delivery is something I have not heard about much in India. She recommended a handful of very useful things for us and explained clearly why she was doing so. We saw the results of that rather quickly. \nNot only was she our doctor, she is also very dear to us because of her charisma, friendliness  and impeccable character. She ensured that both of us were not stressed in any way throughout our checkups and also on the day of birth. \nWhen my partner went into active labour suddenly, she was constantly reachable and ensured that everything proceeded on her instructions despite her not immediately being there. \nTo give a snippet of our day of labour, Dr. Sneha met with an accident while on the way to to the hospital to deal with us. Despite that, she got herself to the labour room with a properly bruised shin, limping because she wanted to somehow deliver our child. She continuously worked for 6 hours straight and did everything she could possibly do to give birth to our son vaginally. \nShe had already accepted our birth plan in a very reasonable manner and was very open about me being beside my partner during the birth. She was very clear, early on, on what was possible and what wasn't during the procedure. \nNo other doctor, I'm sure, would have done that because the baby had pooped quite a bit of meconium (Grade III) and it was meant to be a classic case of an emergency C section. \nDr. Sneha was very clear that as long as the fetal heart rate did not drop, she was going to do everything in her power to do a natural birth. There were various complications like the cord being wrapped around the baby's head and the baby being much bigger than expected. \nNot only she took care of the birth  so well but also my partner after strenuous labour. She checked on us frequently during our stay in the hospital and ensured that we felt comfortable and were clear on the recovery stages. \nI cannot recommend her enough for any pregnancy or birth related consultations irrespective of where you are located in Bengaluru. \nThank you Dr. Sneha for helping us with the mental strength to get through what was a very tough birth for my partner. \n",

We could reach her any time in case of emergency or concerning events, for a first-time expecting couple even small things become big worries, but she was always there for us.\nIn first trimester we faced complexity of sub-chronic bleeding, but it was well treated by her guidance and medication. \nIt was not an easy journey, but we knew that our baby was in good hands.\nWe had normal delivery, but it wasn\u2019t an easy one. Our Baby weight was on higher side with umbilical cord looped tightly around the neck. The go to solution was cesarean, but Dr. Sneha inspired positivity and gave us an option of normal delivery. \nThis was a big decision for us, the trust and confidence on Dr. Sneha made us opt for the normal delivery.\nA BIG THANKS TO DR. SNEHA RAJIV FOR EVERYTHING!",

I was recommended Dr Sneha by a closed source. The moment we met her , I did not have second thought. After each consultation I felt so relaxed , so positive and confident about my journey . She was very practical at the same time caring . She didn\u2019t prescribe any unnecessary medicines , tests but did everything what was required . I blindly trusted her and followed all her instructions ( ofcourse with lot of silly questions which she tolerated \ud83d\ude00) . The best part about her is in each and every visit , she would give us full attention, all her time without hurry or rushing which helped us to create patient - doctor friendly bond ,which is very very crucial , specially in pregnancy. I have seen many of my friends changing doctors at various stages of their pregnancy , but for me our biggest blessing was having her as a doctor right from the beginning till the delivery . My whole journey was so smooth without any complications which I owe it to her . It\u2019s important to have relaxed mind during pregnancy and since she was only a call / wats app away , I never had to bother about anything related to pregnancy. And the day of my delivery, she recommended what is best for me and my baby and took timely decision which helped both of us to be safe and healthy \ud83d\ude0a. She was there at every stage , caring and ensuring that we are taken care. \n\nIn today\u2019s world , it\u2019s difficult to find genuine people and specially doctors whom we can trust completely. I would say we were really lucky in this case . She will always have her big smile (which is also her identity \ud83d\ude01) and makes things and conversations so easy . Never met any doctor who is this cool and reachable anytime .\n\nPlease consult her without any second thought and your pregnancy journey will be amazing . Thank you Dr Sneha once again for giving us our bundle of joy. We are grateful to you . ",

I was a little bit worried about choosing the right Ob-gyn for continuing my check ups here. I saw the reviews in Practo for Dr. Sneha mam and I thought I should go to her to continue with my pregnancy checkups further. My initial visit with mam was very convincing and she cleared all my doubts well and also asked me to contact her in case of any issues. Mam also encouraged me to be healthy and exercise well. She suggested a prenatal yoga instructor (Ambica Mam) and encouraged me to do yoga for pains arising during pregnancy. It also helped me to sleep well without any pain issues until my due date. Any pregnancy issue was constantly monitored by mam. Finally, the day arrived and on June 13th early morning I joined the ER. Mam personally called me and gave me confidence when pains were induced. When the time for delivery was coming close, mam was there and I strongly remember mam telling me \" Don't give up on pains, I can see the head of the baby\". She was a mentor during the last stages of my delivery constantly encouraging me to give pains. When the time has arrived she confidently handled the situation and took out my baby. Despite having a AF leakage, I was able to deliver normally with a healthy baby and all the credit goes to Sneha mam. She was always on time, very concerning about her patients and very attentive when we have any issues. Specially, during this covid situation, she minimized our physical visits to hospitals and did online consultation to reduce the spread of covid to us. She also share us very important information on Covid and Pre-post pregnancy. I strongly recommend her because she has a strong determination to give the best to her patients and take care of them 24*7. Love you mam.. :)\nAlways thankful,\nDivya & Saketh",

Initially i started consulting different doctor but because of her absence we met Dr. Sneha Rajeev , might be it's coincidence that we were not happy with earlier doctor and it was best fit with Dr. Sneha Rajeev. \ud83d\ude0a so we continued and got medical & moral support from the doctor, the scanning and baby grouth was fine, we were getting right treatment. As the Doctor is flexible and knows********** ******** so my days went smooth. I have to mention that in some cases i was having cold fever and was unwell , so doctor was able to help me over phone/Wattsapp , good thing is she remembers you and your condition, which is missing in these days cities like Bangalore. Doctor had exactly given my delivery day as mine was C section, though we had different dates for delivery but happened as doctor mentioned date so doctor has rightly stated the date. Finally during 9th month, i was home and on 12th Dec 2019 night 8.30 pm, I started uneasiness and we immediately informed Dr. Sneha Rajeev and got admitted to emergency section, Doctor herself made available for the delivery at time 11.30 pm , i got delivered a beautiful baby girl without going through any problems and complications , I am very greatful to Dr. Sneha Rajeev , she is such a down to earth person and proper consultation guidance to myself. My first delivery was in Cloud9 Malleswaram and this baby in PeopleTree , my experience was wonderful.",

Within a month of meeting her I conceived and continued to meet her throughout my pregnancy. She is a very friendly person, explains every single thing in detailed manner. In between my pregnancy, my water level was low for which she took care by giving appropriate medication and was sorted later. There were regular checkups and I could ask her any sort of doubts without any hesitation. I had emergency C-section, I was admitted to the hospital the night before and throughout the night she made sure that I was not worried about anything and she kept on checking my health and baby's pulse rate through the hospital staff. The surgery happened the next early morning which was done by her and before the surgery she explained the reasons why I had emergency C-section and how there was nothing to worry about. Finally my baby girl was born and everything went well. Even the post delivery care was satisfactory by the hospital staffs and the doctor. I will be always grateful to the doctor and the other staffs for what they have done. ",

I progressed well with good pain relief and delivered normally. The skill and patience she has appreciated. She came early Morning at 3am for delivery. I am very lucky that got my delivery done with such a great, expert, experienced, kind personality. Words can't express the love and appreciation i have in my heart for you mam. Medicine cures diseases but only doctor can cure patients as im very sensitive to pain i felt more relief with her words. I felt homely atmostphere at hospital because of her support. Thank you so much for all your support during my pregnancy and delivery. Special thanks for you came in the early morning 3am that you have took risk for me. Just close your eyes and choose the doctor for pregnancy and delivery.Thank you for everything mam.",

My amniotic liquid level was on lower side during 36th week she helped me with right consultation to get through it  & also helped me on vaginal delivery & every silly questions are answered without any hesitation.Please get to know about \"EPIDURAL\" during labour pain, eases contractions which was also advised by Dr. Sneha. We were confused initially weather to opt epidural or no. As advised by Doctor, taking epidural it was very safe &  also very very very helpful during final stages. Thanks a ton to Dr. Sneha who helped me throughout for having a safe vaginal delivery. Also thanks to the team (Sandhya, Deepa, Nischita and Jaya) for staying beside during labour. \nOne happy patient who trusted her friendly doctor.\n ",

After our first consultation only - My husband and I felt completely at ease and got sure that we wanted to be consult Dr Sneha only during the entire pregnancy period.\n\nAnother thing which I would like to highlight is that Dr Sneha has an innate ability to put a patient at ease and she never tries to overcomplicate things and will only prescribe medicines which are necessary and also will never force you to go for unnecessary tests. During my pregnancy I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes and before meeting Dr Sneha, I was consulting at a \"Big reputed hospital\" wherein they were only trying to sell panic. After consulting Dr Sneha, I was able to manage my diabetes only through diet and walk and never had to take any pill. I can only say - being pregnant and delivering a child is probably the hardest task a woman undertakes and at this critical time to find a doctor who is skilled as well as humane can surely make the journey smooth and easy. \n\nAgain articulating that I feel extremely lucky to have found Dr Sneha and would recommend her to anyone in a heartbeat. Thank you doctor and keep shining.",

I have recently delivered a baby girl by Dr. Sneha Rajiv at Sparsh hospital.\nThank you Sneha madam for facilitating such a wonderful milestone in our life's.\nWe are very fortunate to say that we met a doctor who is having a deep kindness and friendliness with her patients.\nWe have received a very good treatment from Dr. Sneha from the day one when I undergone my ectopic surgery in 2019. She is very compassionate and approachable for anyone those who needs any kinds of gynecological issues/requirements.\nShe has guided us to set a route map to undergo infertility treatments from 2019 and we have succeeded finally by getting a QUEEN BABY on the new year occasion.\nDr. Sneha's magical presence uplifted we both of us to a stage with lots of positive emotions in our difficult times. She has boosted our confidence and that taken me to the labour room for a normal delivery.\nI have seen Dr. Sneha's interactions in the form of good physical treatments, clear advise, quick instructions, timely orders and which enable us to create a good rapport with her.\n \nDr. Sneha, you are one of the gift of God. There is a huge positive energy contained in you. Let your power house pump a lot of energy to make more births. Let more people approach you for getting served better \u2026.better ......and the best from you.\n\nRegards,\nSandeep and Shyni",

My day one of Pregnancy starts with sneha ma'am and finally she handed my angel baby girl with all safe hands to me. There were several ups and downs in this journey of 9 months which were literally became easier because of ma'am's guidance. She takes care of each small requirement of her patients. Initially I had low HCG she guided how to tackle that, then during 2nd trimester I faced with low CBC she immediately asked me to take all medication to get my CBC in range, and the final stage which was with much difficulty as baby got 2 loops in neck along with baby's potty discharge inside the womb... At that moment how strongly she took the decision as at that time she was out of station and attended in the mid night of 2am and done the surgery . Without sneha ma'am I don't know how i could have tackled myself . Me & my husband feels blessed to get ma'am as our doctor. She is such a sweet, caring, friendly natured.. words becomes less to explain. Reason of our happiness we owe to ma'am only. I can strongly recommend to Ma'am. Thank you for everything Ma'am.

She was like a boon for me, my wife and my baby, we were so comfortable with her, she explained all the things with patience and was always available for any advise even during COVID Pandemic, she kept motivating my wife and kept her attitude positive, when she saw signs of normal delivery she was patient enough so that that my baby completes full cycle of pregnancy. I was very pleased when she recommended us to a scan center where the quality of test and scans were far more better and cheaper when compared to rates charged by hospitals. I came across her expertise when she single handedly took control when during labor and my baby was born normally in front of me, I never imagined that I would be so lucky to witness the entire procedure in front me, that was all possible because of Dr Sneha Rajiv because she kept motivating us and always guided us.

I had  a normal delivery. \nShe was very supportive and guided me throughout the process. She encouraged and motivated to go through the labour pain. So glad to have met her and we had her by our side throughout my pregnancy journey.",

She doesn\u2019t share a doctor patient relation with her patient but make you feel so comfortable and friendly that you can share anything with her . I went to people tree hospital for a second opinion as I was diagnosed with a cervical polyp in a different hospital and was asked to have a surgery done immediately stating that my polyp is quite big and needs to be removed urgently . I was quite worried And was ready to go for the surgery but my husband asked me to go for a second opinion so we went to people tree hospital and that\u2019s is when i met Dr. Sneha. When I met her I felt a very positive and friendly vibe. After she examined me and I after telling her my problem she told me it can be due to hormonal change . So I told her the entire story of being diagnosed with polyp . She immediately send me for a scan and no polyp could be detected and just to satisfy and pacify me . She along with two of her colleagues-have personally scanned and looked for it .A small some mm polyp could be detected and I was ready to have a surgery done but Dr. sneha informed me not to go for the surgery and to wait for few more months as messing up with the cervical can put me in problem while conceiving . I kept a follow up with her for two months and thanks to her advice today I am polyp free without having to undergo any medication and surgery . The cloth of blood came out on its own which was causing me problem . It\u2019s very difficult to come across such genuine doctors this days  who give genuine and do service from the heart . Me and my husband can\u2019t thank her enough as I was in a very sensitive phase . I am 34 years married and haven\u2019t conceive yet . Undergoing the surgery would have made me not being able to be a mother my entire life . I have found a friend in Dr. sneha and I can rely on her for any gyneac problem. \n \nPeopletree hospital is a small hospital comparatively with other hospitals .Before my gynac issue I have also went for a dental fill up . The doctors are great and I always have had the best experience inregards  to doctors. ",

But she was supportive of this decision.During labour, Dr. Sneha suggested me for epidural as it would be very difficult for me to bear the pain. It was easier for me to give birth normally with epidural.I would like to thank Dr Sneha and her team and would highly recommend her.",

It was great to meet you and thank you for everything.\n\nI always believe you are God sent and blessed. \n\nWith lots of love and gratitude,\nAnna",

She has always been very good with her explanation about the progress of my pregnancy and I have always been satisfied with my appointments with her. She guided us (my husband and me) very well throughout the pregnancy and I have found her always to be practical and to the point. \nIn my 37th week of pregnancy, she assessed my situation well from the physical examination made which helped us make a critical call in time without any panic or fear.\nEven though I delivered earlier than the EDD, Dr Sneha\u2019s guidance and care helped us reach the finish line without any hassles or anxieties. We got to go home early and happy with our healthy bundle of joy.\nOverall, my experience with Dr Sneha Rajiv has been wonderful and I am truly happy to recommend her to young women looking for a good and experienced OBGYN. \n\nShwetha",

This helped in maintaining the same within limits. Her patience and listening skills are appreciative and she answered to all our queries in detail during the visits. She was always reachable over call/message which helped in checking with her on any issues/emergency.\nWe are very thankful to the doctor for the support she extended during these anxious and testing times and ensured a safe pregnancy and delivery. Thanks a ton doctor!!! \n\nJust as her name, she is a very friendly person and soft spoken and this quality helped us to discuss at ease with her. \nI would definitely like to recommend Dr. Sneha Rajiv for pregnancy and delivery related visits and care. \n\nCheers & Thank You, \nPriya",

Dr.Sneha suggested us to go for epidural based on my wife\u2019s condition which was very helpful in normal delivery. \n\nRecommendation: \nI would definitely recommend Dr.Sneha to anyone who is looking for a doctor who is available, friendly, an expert in the area and much more.\nI sincerely thank Dr.Sneha for all the guidance and wish her the best for the future.

She is quite caring and detailed in her work which assured me as a patient that all was being taken care. Right from detecting pregnancy to last moments of child birth, Dr Sneha Rajiv showed the path to us in the journey and we felt blessed. She motivated us a lot at the final stages of pregnancy and ensured we delivered in a healthy way. She also gave us an option for epidural which was one of the best decision as it reduced 90% of the pain during normal delivery. I recommend all the to be mommies to try epidural for some pain relief during normal delivery. Thanks a lot Sneha mam for your support and guidance.",

She listens what the patient is trying to say and she explains the things and make you understand. And the day my wife got admitted in the same day I am blessed with a baby girl  with normal delivery. I am extremely happy the way she took control of the situation and took personal care of the patient and well being of the baby at the same time. I almost gave up the option of normal delivery due to wife's weakness. But she was in firm believe that it should be a normal delivery. And she allowed me to get in Labour room especially for me to encourage the patient during the delivery. It was not less than a miracle for me. It reminds me of the proverb that Doctor are the God in disguise. Finally I would like to give a big thank you to Dr. SNEHA and her Team.",

We consulted Dr. Sneha Rajiv from the beginning and I should say we didn't need anyone better. \n\nOur rapport with her was very well established on the first visit. She listened to our history completely to understand us better. Every questions and queries we had were completely addressed. She also adapted to our convenience and comfort in every follow up and visits.\n\nShe was comfortable speaking to the entire family and setting things clear on what's feasible and what's  not. Her explanation on medications, diet and excercises were clear and helped my wife a lot. She promised my wife that she would be with my wife during labour/delivery and she was there.\n\nShe also took a step more of being a friend to my wife. She answered our messages seeking clarifications whenever a visit was not possible. She also keeps track of appointments and proactively informed us well before to postpone or prepone visits due to emergencies. She also hosted quite a few informative sessions to many expecting mothers, we missed many of the sessions though. \n\nI would assure that her other patients would have the same to say and maybe more. To sum up I would say my wife didn't need anyone better.  A big thanks to her.",

This was a very precious n sensitive pregnancy in our case.I switched to Dr. Sneha mam when I was around 6 months pregnant. Initially was skeptical about changing the doctor, but proved to be right decision in the end. doctor was very friendly, supportive and was available online whenever required. She encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle during and post pregnancy which helped me a lot. It was a planned c section due to some medical reason and we welcomed our little angel in January 2021. we are very greatful to sneha mam for making it a smooth journey.  I highly recommend sneha mam for the way of interacting with the patient and boosting confidence in them.",
