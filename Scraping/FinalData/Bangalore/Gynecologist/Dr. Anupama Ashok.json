You just have to ask for the impossible, in prayer.'I was diagnosed with stage IV Adenomyosis and endometriosis; blocked tubes. I was left with no hopes what so ever of conceiving.Time was ticking away too! I consider myself extremely fortunate to have crossed paths with Dr. Anupama Ashok. She has been the driving force right from inception. What seemed impossible in the beginning, she literally made me walk baby steps. Dr. Anupama is such a humble and down to earth person. You rarely come across such a gem of a person. She exactly knows what she is doing and even the times I doubted myself, she held up my spirits. She has this beautiful aura that you just want to close your eyes and let her lead you. She has this unshakeable faith in God and in everything she does. Her expertise in the field is unparalleled. She has an excellent team working for her at Amogha Fertility Clinic. No fancy clinic, no pompous showoff , no handing out exorbitant IVF packages. Her simplicity is what drew me to her and made me believe strongly. Right from inception, she has always explained each and everything in a clear manner. Despite being so busy, she has answered all my queries over call or whatsapp, checked on me. Just by meeting her and talking to her, half of my worries were put to rest. I knew I was at the right place! She has this calm persona! She went out of her way and helped us out. It's through her sheer determination, expert guidance and unshakeable faith in God that has made the miracle happen. I got pregnant with 1 cycle of Frozen Embryo Transfer. I and my husband will forever be indebted to her. I want each and every couple battling infertility to reach out to Dr. Anupama Ashok at Amogha Fertility Clinic. ",

                "review_text": "I met Dr Anupama Ashok at Columbia Asia Hospital last year. I was diagnosed with Endometriosis which led to infertility. After couple of laparoscopic procedures we met Dr Anupama Ashok. She was very understanding in everything and always tried to boost my morale. I was such a girl who was scared of TVS at the first stage but by her support and patient handling we could complete our treatment successfully. Doctor was very clear of the procedures, is she was sure of a particular treatment not working she wouldn't suggest or want to try that and she saves time and money, initially doctor had advised for 3 cycles of IUI but as I had increased complications due to multiple endometric cysts Doctor took a call after one cycle of IUI and we immediately started off with IVF with out wasting any time. Every single scan and procedures were handled with much care and she made all efforts to be less painful and made me very much comfortable through out the treatment. We had one cycle of IVF and I m blessed with twins now. Doctor also goes an extra mile to monitor patients records when we had to do clinical tests for the procedures, she would always follow it up for results much before we get to know the results this was very surprising as a doctor who meets 50 patients everyday is able to give individual attention and preferences. She was also available on phone for any kind of emergency situations. I would definitely recommend Dr. Anupama Ashok for anyone who is struggling with infertility issues. She is been a blessing to us. We feel lucky that we were in the right hands and still it feels unbelievable that I could also conceive  with so many complications . All thanks to the Doctor. \n",

She simply gave me some hormonal tablets. ** ****** *** I got my pregnancy next month. \nI can't describe my fear before I got her.

You just have to ask for the impossible, in prayer.'I was diagnosed with stage IV Adenomyosis and endometriosis; blocked tubes. I was left with no hopes what so ever of conceiving.Time was ticking away too! I consider myself extremely fortunate to have crossed paths with Dr. Anupama Ashok. She has been the driving force right from inception. What seemed impossible in the beginning, she literally made me walk baby steps. Dr. Anupama is such a humble and down to earth person. You rarely come across such a gem of a person. She exactly knows what she is doing and even the times I doubted myself, she held up my spirits. She has this beautiful aura that you just want to close your eyes and let her lead you. She has this unshakeable faith in God and in everything she does. Her expertise in the field is unparalleled. She has an excellent team working for her at Amogha Fertility Clinic. No fancy clinic, no pompous showoff , no handing out exorbitant IVF packages. Her simplicity is what drew me to her and made me believe strongly. Right from inception, she has always explained each and everything in a clear manner. Despite being so busy, she has answered all my queries over call or whatsapp, checked on me. Just by meeting her and talking to her, half of my worries were put to rest. I knew I was at the right place! She has this calm persona! She went out of her way and helped us out. It's through her sheer determination, expert guidance and unshakeable faith in God that has made the miracle happen. I got pregnant with 1 cycle of Frozen Embryo Transfer. I and my husband will forever be indebted to her. I want each and every couple battling infertility to reach out to Dr. Anupama Ashok at Amogha Fertility Clinic. ",

                "review_text": "I met Dr Anupama Ashok at Columbia Asia Hospital last year. I was diagnosed with Endometriosis which led to infertility. After couple of laparoscopic procedures we met Dr Anupama Ashok. She was very understanding in everything and always tried to boost my morale. I was such a girl who was scared of TVS at the first stage but by her support and patient handling we could complete our treatment successfully. Doctor was very clear of the procedures, is she was sure of a particular treatment not working she wouldn't suggest or want to try that and she saves time and money, initially doctor had advised for 3 cycles of IUI but as I had increased complications due to multiple endometric cysts Doctor took a call after one cycle of IUI and we immediately started off with IVF with out wasting any time. Every single scan and procedures were handled with much care and she made all efforts to be less painful and made me very much comfortable through out the treatment. We had one cycle of IVF and I m blessed with twins now. Doctor also goes an extra mile to monitor patients records when we had to do clinical tests for the procedures, she would always follow it up for results much before we get to know the results this was very surprising as a doctor who meets 50 patients everyday is able to give individual attention and preferences. She was also available on phone for any kind of emergency situations. I would definitely recommend Dr. Anupama Ashok for anyone who is struggling with infertility issues. She is been a blessing to us. We feel lucky that we were in the right hands and still it feels unbelievable that I could also conceive  with so many complications . All thanks to the Doctor. \n",

Her friendliness (I should mention her serene face and slow walk) professional approach impressed me first, second thing was her low usage of medication. She smrtly handled my case and just after 20 days of seeing her I got my periods on time and ovulated on time. She simply gave me some hormonal tablets. ** ****** *** I got my pregnancy next month. \nI can't describe my fear before I got her.

Hence, I asked as why is there a slot for 4 - 5 to which they had no answer.

She is methodical, thorough and has so much clarity in what steps to take to achieve our objective. She is patient and is always forthcoming in explaining the process clearly and answering all our questions. She makes you feel in control and includes you as an integral part of the decision making process.\n\nShe uses the best quality meds,  individualised protocols and latest research to achieve optimum results -  our first cycle itself has been successful with her and we are on our way to having a healthy child.\n\nShe is constantly in touch with us and checks on us to see if everything is going fine - even when we are transferred to a gynaecologist. We are so happy to have met such a kind human being.",

She was very kind, calm and composed. Before going through treatment she would explain all the stages and also everything I would go through. Anupama ma'am was very careful about the process initiation as she knew exactly which cycle would be more effective. She wouldn't delegate everything to subordinates as she followed the tests and results closely. We would visit her diligently as we had put all our faith on her. Though the first time I didn't conceive, Anupama ma'am gave confidence to us explaining the reason why it was not positive and persuaded to try again. We decided to try another time. There were times when the process was getting delayed for unforeseen issues and we were feeling uneasy. Nevertheless, we persisted to follow and finally the efforts bore fruit. Today we are parents to a healthy boy, our bundle of joy!! Words fall short of expressing gratitude to her. Thank you Dr Anupama Ma'am!! Following this success story, we have recommended to another relative, and she too will have a success story waiting to be told ahead.",

I was closely following my sister's fertility treatment. And when the efforts bore fruit, I had a ray of hope. Though my body had known the pain of those injections piercing me umpteen number of times, I decided to try one last time. I had to give up my flourishing career and I was mentally prepared for that too. As my sister said Dr Anupama ma'am was very kind, calm and composed. She would closely follow the cycles, my tests and results. During the pandemic, she had advised to postpone the treatment which again increased my anxiety. Finally she herself called up asking to undergo the test again. Her attention to detail and the sense of urgency impressed me a lot! Today I have a success story growing in me. Thank you Dr Anupama Ma'am. As my sister says, Words fall short of expressing gratitude to her! I would recommend her to everyone.",
