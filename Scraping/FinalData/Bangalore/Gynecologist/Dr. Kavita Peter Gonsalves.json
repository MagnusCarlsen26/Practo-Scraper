Not only has she taken great care of my health but she has made sure in all possible ways in having the normal delivery as it was my first baby. She explained everything to me in a very clear manner at every stage / trimester that had helped me lot in preparing myself for the journey in becoming Mother. She is lovely to speak with at every appointment or for a quick chat through whatsapp.\n\nI have to mention few lines on her dedication / commitment, on the date/time I encounterd the labour symptoms almost during the same time she encounterd a family emergency but she made sure and visited me and promised to come back for the delivery process during her absence she was in touch with fellow doctors and instructed as required at different labour stage finally around 4:30am when i was fully dilated she was back and able to deliver normally.\n\nIt\u2019s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touch/commitment/dedication along with outstanding quality of medical knowledge. I would highly recommend her. Thank you again & your team at labour ward for all the support in this journey. \n",
