I got done IUI procedure by Dr.Apoorva Reddy  and got pregnant in that cycle done .   Dr asked me to give blood test ie tsh, hba1c, vit d , HIV in this clinic only . They told once the reports are ready , you will get a call from clinic regarding the tests given . I got a call from clinic after a day , saying that everything in reports are fine only sugar is bit high so avoid any sugary foods that’s it . I asked them to send the reports by any means either by WhatsApp or email . They told will send in 5 mins but they never sent at all . I kept on calling but no one sent them . I had appointment with dr after two weeks . When I went that time they had kept the reports in my file only after two weeks of giving my blood test . Then seeing reports the dr tells me that my thyroid is HIGH , VITAMIN D IS VERY LOW and HBA1C is slightly elevated. So immediately start with thyroid tablets , vit d and come back after a week for a scan . **** *** *** ***** ********** **** ** ** ***** ****  *** ***** ** **** *** *** ******* ********** **** ***** ** **** * 
I came back after a week for a scan. Scan was done and they told heartbeat is very less and be ready for anything to happen , and we’ll wait for a week for another scan . The dr didn’t give any hope but told we might have to abort if we didn’t hear any heart beat in next week . After a week , the heartbeat was completely stopped and she told that we have to abort it immediately. Gave medications , I started bleeding heavy and after two weeks came back and scanned for remains . There was a less than 1 cm remains in the cervix. Dr. Apoorva Pallam Reddy asked me to do D&E ( which costs ₹.35000) immediately and she asked me start to prep for the surgery on the same day . I trusted her and got done D&E .  

After two period cycles , she suggested we do an IUI again . We did , and we conceived in that cycle also .  This time when we went to Dr, she didn’t ask me take any other blood test other than beta Hcg . **** *** *** ****** ********** ** **** * She put me on blood thinner injections which I have to put every day where single injections they prescribe cost ₹425 . Along with lot other ,only medications which will cost you per day ₹250 . (₹.675 per day * 8 weeks ) . This time for up to 8 weeks of my pregnancy I was taking all these meds and inj daily, but after 8 weeks scan the dr said that my pregnancy was a blighted ovum and we should immediately abort . But this time she said we have to do a D&E SURGERY ITSELF DIRECTLY AND SEND THE PRODUCTS FOR GENETICAL TESTING WHICH WILL COST ME 35000 for D&E AND 18000 for GENETIC TESTING . I asked why aren’t we using any medications this time for aborting instead of D&E ? She replied , as MEDICATIONS WILL NOT AT ALL WORK THIS TIME AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER YOU WANT TO GET THE GENETIC TESTING done , D&E IS THE ONLY OPTION LEFT FOR ME  TO GET THE REMAINS OUT .  

We were a little skeptical this time , so we took second opinion from two doctors one from Cloudnine and other from Fortis . As we didn’t wanted to do D&E directly without taking meds first .

Another thing about the clinic is that , with scans they don’t provide any kind of reports to the scan copy but charge you same like other places . When I went for second opinion , other doctors are asking me for scan reports . Medicines also which they prescribe , they will make you buy there only as you will not get them anywhere outside.

My husband and I both shared an ease with Dr Apoorva Reddy approach. She has lot of patience. I was already consulting dietitian and she supported along with that diet. At each appointment she always takes time to explain. Never once making us feel rushed. I had totally believed her and followed what ever she prescribed. I am forever great full for the ways that Dr Apoorva imparted my health and living life with PCOS. I would strongly recommend her to any family and friends without hesitation. We are once happy couple now that I am mother of our first child and good news is that it was normal delivery which was a big surprise for my family and friends big thanks to Dr Apoorva who did normal delivery for me. 

I want to express my gratitude to the team of nurses and doctors who took care of me during my pregnancy time.

I was told nothing, they did not even give me the report. Once I got back home I realised it was the same scan performed twice. Whatever the reason was me as a patient should have been informed about what they were doing. 
2. After meeting Dr. she suggested about HyCoSy - The Dr told me that they were doing fallopian tube test, but never said what that test was, how it will be performed, what are the risks and infections involved what are the preparations I should take before the procedure, nothing was informed.
