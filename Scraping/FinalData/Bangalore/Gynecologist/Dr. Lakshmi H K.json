Doctor recommended me to perform some important detailed tests to confirm the health condition of the Baby.\n\nI received the test results post 15 days and it was a painful end result for us. I lost the baby because of health conditions in the womb. This moment in our life was very much miserable and difficult to overcome the situation.\n\nDr. Lakshmi HK was very much encouraging and gave us the hope and belief that this is not the end. We are really grateful for this Doctor. \n\nPost six months later I was naturally conceived and under the Medications and Moral support of Dr Lakshmi HK everything was fine.\n\nIn the 5th month of my pregnancy, based on month on month scans it was identified that I might expect the Pre-Term delivery because of few medical reasons. I and My husband were worried hearing these result.\n\nDr. Lakshmi HK was on consistently touch with me on Daily basis to confirm the symptoms of the Pregnancy. Also Doctor prescribed a weekly injections until I crossover the risk stage.\n\nThen I successfully crossed the danger zone and delivered a healthy girl baby without any medical complications in Columbia Asia Hebbal.\nAll this good happened only because of Dr Lakshmi HK, we are blessed to get such a helpful Doctor at the right time.\n\nNow my baby is about 6 months, Me and my husband want to thank Dr Lakshmi HK heart fully.\n\nThanks for everything Dr. Lakshmi HK, yours Counseling was the best of my life. \n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSavitha Sunil Kumar\t\n",

Though she had mild complications in pregnancy during the 3rd month, doctor took immediate steps and was always available. The pregnancy journey was very cherishing and memorable only because we were in the safe hands of Dr. Lakshmi. On the delivery day, doctor was constantly monitoring my wife and helped her deliver normally through her timely action and suggestions, even though it was late at night.

Doctor recommended me to perform some important detailed tests to confirm the health condition of the Baby.\n\nI received the test results post 15 days and it was a painful end result for us. I lost the baby because of health conditions in the womb. This moment in our life was very much miserable and difficult to overcome the situation.\n\nDr. Lakshmi HK was very much encouraging and gave us the hope and belief that this is not the end. We are really grateful for this Doctor. \n\nPost six months later I was naturally conceived and under the Medications and Moral support of Dr Lakshmi HK everything was fine.\n\nIn the 5th month of my pregnancy, based on month on month scans it was identified that I might expect the Pre-Term delivery because of few medical reasons. I and My husband were worried hearing these result.\n\nDr. Lakshmi HK was on consistently touch with me on Daily basis to confirm the symptoms of the Pregnancy. Also Doctor prescribed a weekly injections until I crossover the risk stage.\n\nThen I successfully crossed the danger zone and delivered a healthy girl baby without any medical complications in Columbia Asia Hebbal.\nAll this good happened only because of Dr Lakshmi HK, we are blessed to get such a helpful Doctor at the right time.\n\nNow my baby is about 6 months, Me and my husband want to thank Dr Lakshmi HK heart fully.\n\nThanks for everything Dr. Lakshmi HK, yours Counseling was the best of my life. \n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSavitha Sunil Kumar\t\n",

The very next month my wife conceived, and we visited Dr. Lakshmi for the pregnancy check-ups regularly. She is truly an amazing doctor who cares so much for her patients and answers all our questions with clarity and patience. Though she had mild complications in pregnancy during the 3rd month, doctor took immediate steps and was always available. The pregnancy journey was very cherishing and memorable only because we were in the safe hands of Dr. Lakshmi. On the delivery day, doctor was constantly monitoring my wife and helped her deliver normally through her timely action and suggestions, even though it was late at night. We were blessed to have been treated by such a doctor who works so passionately, and I highly recommend Dr. Lakshmi ** *** **** ************ *** *************",
