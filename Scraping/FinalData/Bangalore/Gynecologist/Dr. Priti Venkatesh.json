She is very detail oriented and caught a very important aspect around the baby's position that hadn't been caught in 5 earlier sonography across 3 cities. She even shared a hand-drawn diagram along with the reports and did a subsequent call with my gynaecologist to explain the exact issue which ensured a very smooth delivery for us. This shows how much she cares for her patients. Lack of this critical information could have made the delivery very difficult for us - we were blessed to have met her at the right time!",
