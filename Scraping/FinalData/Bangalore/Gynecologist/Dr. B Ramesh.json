                "review_text": "On a preliminary clinical report my wife was diagnosed with a Large Right Adnexal mass. Our physician, with whom we did our initial consultation, advised us to get it investigated further with a Laparoscopic Surgeon, since mass was quite large and it can't be removed or treated with conventional medicines or treatment.\nFirst thought came in my mind was Dr. B. Ramesh, who had already done a laparoscopic surgery for my Son, eight years ago i.e during May 2013 when he suffered on an a/c of Acute Appendicitis. That time we had a very unique experience with Dr. Ramesh Sir, who did the surgery with utmost care and professional expertise.\nSo, this time also, with the same expectations in our mind we met Dr. Ramesh at his Altius, with lot of mental agony due to my wife's health condition. Though we met him almost after eight years, we could feel that he is reciprocating with the same intensity of humbleness and care. After examining my wife the first word he told us was \"NOT TO WORRY AND I AM THERE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU\". His words were so powerful and strong and we bust in to tears with emotion. He eased us and explained very patiently on how to go about and the next course of action we have to do. He Kept in front of us all the options available and how he going to treat and perform the surgery.\nAs per his advise, we did all the investigations and met him for the second time. By the time we reached to him his back-end team updated him with all the reports and he was well informed & prepared with his surgical procedure on What to do and How he going to do it?. Though he is fully aware about the vulnerability of the condition he didn't exposed it to us, instead he was so composed, and explained the procedure to us calmly and with utmost care.\nAs advised by him, we got my wife admitted and on the same day Dr. Ramesh with his team of Doctors and Paramedical staff did the surgery to my wife. The whole surgical procedure took close to two to three hours. Here the most important part to mention is about the \"Frozen Section Biopsy of the excised mass\" which he planned in advance and did it during the surgery procedure. The excised mass was sent to a Special Pathological center which is almost 5 to 6 kms (around 20 mins drive) away from the hospital where the surgery was performed. Dr. Ramesh and his team of Drs were on a Hot line call with the pathologist and were waiting for the report so that they can proceed further and complete the procedure. The whole process was almost 30 to 45 mins and during this time Dr. Ramesh and his Medical team were on the Surgical table along with my wife. We can't explain it in words with what precision, timing and coordination it was done. I don't think any other surgeon can do it or take such a high risk decision. Here only Dr. Ramesh pinnacle care for service stood more than his professional skills. It pays immense value to the patients and their families.\nMy wife got discharged within 3 days after the surgery and she was perfectly alright. Me and my family would like to Thank Dr. Ramesh Sir and his whole Medical team & Paramedical staff, Support staff including the administrative staff wholeheartedly and show our gratitude to each and every one of them who supported in our difficult times.\n\n\"Life is just not about how you live but about how you give! And what I give is something that remains for not just for a lifetime but affects many lives to come. That's what I Love about what I do. I Am here!\".\nHe is 100% true to his statement and he is a TRUE HUMAN BEING and also something Special in him. We pray God to give Dr. Ramesh for a long and Healthy life so that he can bring changes to many people's life.\nThank You Doctor.\n",

                "review_text": "On a preliminary clinical report my wife was diagnosed with a Large Right Adnexal mass. Our physician, with whom we did our initial consultation, advised us to get it investigated further with a Laparoscopic Surgeon, since mass was quite large and it can't be removed or treated with conventional medicines or treatment.\nFirst thought came in my mind was Dr. B. Ramesh, who had already done a laparoscopic surgery for my Son, eight years ago i.e during May 2013 when he suffered on an a/c of Acute Appendicitis. That time we had a very unique experience with Dr. Ramesh Sir, who did the surgery with utmost care and professional expertise.\nSo, this time also, with the same expectations in our mind we met Dr. Ramesh at his Altius, with lot of mental agony due to my wife's health condition. Though we met him almost after eight years, we could feel that he is reciprocating with the same intensity of humbleness and care. After examining my wife the first word he told us was \"NOT TO WORRY AND I AM THERE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU\". His words were so powerful and strong and we bust in to tears with emotion. He eased us and explained very patiently on how to go about and the next course of action we have to do. He Kept in front of us all the options available and how he going to treat and perform the surgery.\nAs per his advise, we did all the investigations and met him for the second time. By the time we reached to him his back-end team updated him with all the reports and he was well informed & prepared with his surgical procedure on What to do and How he going to do it?. Though he is fully aware about the vulnerability of the condition he didn't exposed it to us, instead he was so composed, and explained the procedure to us calmly and with utmost care.\nAs advised by him, we got my wife admitted and on the same day Dr. Ramesh with his team of Doctors and Paramedical staff did the surgery to my wife. The whole surgical procedure took close to two to three hours. Here the most important part to mention is about the \"Frozen Section Biopsy of the excised mass\" which he planned in advance and did it during the surgery procedure. The excised mass was sent to a Special Pathological center which is almost 5 to 6 kms (around 20 mins drive) away from the hospital where the surgery was performed. Dr. Ramesh and his team of Drs were on a Hot line call with the pathologist and were waiting for the report so that they can proceed further and complete the procedure. The whole process was almost 30 to 45 mins and during this time Dr. Ramesh and his Medical team were on the Surgical table along with my wife. We can't explain it in words with what precision, timing and coordination it was done. I don't think any other surgeon can do it or take such a high risk decision. Here only Dr. Ramesh pinnacle care for service stood more than his professional skills. It pays immense value to the patients and their families.\nMy wife got discharged within 3 days after the surgery and she was perfectly alright. Me and my family would like to Thank Dr. Ramesh Sir and his whole Medical team & Paramedical staff, Support staff including the administrative staff wholeheartedly and show our gratitude to each and every one of them who supported in our difficult times.\n\n\"Life is just not about how you live but about how you give! And what I give is something that remains for not just for a lifetime but affects many lives to come. That's what I Love about what I do. I Am here!\".\nHe is 100% true to his statement and he is a TRUE HUMAN BEING and also something Special in him. We pray God to give Dr. Ramesh for a long and Healthy life so that he can bring changes to many people's life.\nThank You Doctor.\n",

They offer helpful advice and suggestions and they are prompt to respond to calls. We have not had any negative interactions with anyone and they are our only choice when mom and baby needed care.\nThe hospital on a whole has a good environment and its very clean and really one of a kind..

Dr. Ramesh brought my mom back to her feet after 3 weeks of treatment in the ICU.\nMy mother complained of some discomfort in her abdomen early this year and we visited none other than Dr Ramesh for his expert advise. She was then diagnosed of stones in Common Bile Duct (CBD). The situation was pretty complicated and we were told that it would need a major open cut surgery but Dr. Ramesh did his best and successfully completed the surgery (laproscopic) with minimal invasion which helped in early recovery of about a week's time. All the credit goes to the doctor and his team for their effort and teamwork.\nTHANK YOU, Dr Ramesh B sir\ud83d\ude00\nThe Dr is always on time, compassionate, empathetic, easy to talk to and relates exceptionally well. If you need a great Dr to help you with your health and wellness, do yourself a favor and meet this great man.",

The curtain rod comes above the patients bed , so it's like a private space within the same room. So even the attendant can read etc , without disturbing the patient.\nEvery room has  cable TV , and attached bathrooms have individual geysers for hot water.\n2. Most important in any hospital is post operative care. The nurses here were very  patient ,cooperative , and always accessible. Every floor had a senior  head nurse .\n3.  Charges. ...most hospitals would not allow us to get in unless an advance is paid .\nHere till the surgery was completed , nobody even spoke about charges. In fact only a few hours after the surgery , we paid an advance as well as Pharmacy bill . Costs too were reasonable when compared to corporate hospitals.\n",

At the time of my visit, he explained clearly about the issue  & finally he suggested for operation. \n\nMy mom had bleeding  issue, we thought it is very difficult for mom to get operated but after discussion with Dr. B. Ramesh  we got confidence. Finally we were admitted at hospital for operation. After finishing the surgery, next day itself she started walking. I felt they charged less operation cost when compared to other corporate hospital.\nAmazing Dr Ramesh. \n\nI recommend Dr. B. Ramesh for consulting (Gynaec issues) & even for surgeries. \n\nWould appreciate if canteen facility is available (unfortunately we could not find any other food centers near to the hospital).\n\nRest all is appreciated well & good going !!\n",
