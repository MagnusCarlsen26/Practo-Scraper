I wish to share my experience with Manjula mam. I had a cardiomyopathy issue from my childhood. I got married nd immediately got pregnant. But many doctors advised strictly against pregnancy since it was very risky for my life nd not to continue further. So two times we terminated the baby within 50days of pregnancy. I was very depressed and longing badly for a child in our life. By God's grace we were shifted to Bangalore because of my husband's job nd came to know about Dr.Manjula mam. I got pregnant third time nd visited mam. At the first visit itself she was very positive nd gave us so much confidence nd she was ready to take the risk along with us. She really took all the great efforts to make everything in a very positive nd smooth way nd she referred a cardiologist who is a friend of her. Everything was very smooth throughout out my pregnancy till delivery and finally delivered a baby boy at 37 weeks via c section since it was risky to have a normal delivery. Then after a year we shifted back to our native. I got pregnant again when my son was 1.3yrs old. I was very scared and not in a mentality to visit any doctors there.

 So we immediately called Dr.Manjula mam. We consulted with her virtually till my 5th month but this time it was not a smooth journey. I developed many symptoms like breathlessness, chest pain, high palpitations, etc. So we visited her directly after a long 8hrs journey. But as soon as we met her we got that positivity again in our hearts. Our cardiologist was very upset nd not much happy to continue this pregnancy since my health was not good. But mam gave us lots of hope nd try to get everything positive. She asked us to come at 32 weeks and stay there in Bangalore itself till delivery. She doesn't wish to continue my pregnancy beyond 34 weeks due to my negative ECG nd holter reports. So she asked us to admit immediately at 34 weeks that too not in cloudnine but at the nearby hospital because of the ICU and cardio facilities available there. She literally took more efforts for everything to be very safe nd she was very conscious in arranging all the doctors and procedures in a pre-planned manner.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pregnancy Tests,Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Manjula Deepak Mam is definitely a God-sent angel. She carries positive vibes and I would definitely recommend her for any Gynecology consultations. After having two recurrent miscarriages, we were so shattered and lost hope. But it‚Äôs because of her best treatment and true support that we are happy parents to a lovely baby girl.

Here is our story:

It was at the end of 2019, after going through 2 recurrent miscarriages, that we got to know about Dr. Manjula Deepak Mam from a close friend. We immediately booked a consultation and visited her at Cloud Nine HRBR Layout. On our first visit, she looked (that was the only time) at all our history and lab reports, and patiently listened to us. On our next visit, we were surprised to see that she remembered every single piece of information about my history and she ensured that she provided only the best care and treatment.

Then comes COVID in early 2020. We moved to our hometown, gave ourselves a break, and didn't see a doctor for close to a year. We again planned to resume and mentally prepare for pregnancy around mid-2021. We booked an online video consultation with Dr. Manjula Deepak without hesitation, and you wouldn't believe it, even though we connected with her after a year, she remembered every detail and didn't make me feel any less disconnected, and we resumed from where we left off almost a year ago. The doctor helped me with the next set of plans and diets. She deserves a huge amount of respect for her dedication and for being so passionate about her profession and providing personal attention to every single patient.

I was pregnant again and immediately booked the next video consultation with the doctor. Although all this happened virtually, she ensured I was given the best care and attention and prescribed the medicines to get started with.

We moved back to Bangalore in November 2021 for our future consultations and visited the doctor at the hospital. From then on, it was like a big relief and we were so confident that we had got Manjula Deepak Mam with us. Due to previous complications, we used to be nervous whenever there was a scan, and for everything small, I used to message Mam, as I was afraid that something might go wrong. She replied to each and every question on message without any irritation, even though she was always super busy. It was a high-risk pregnancy, but she handled it very smoothly. Mam is always calm and positive, and some days, though she is awake the whole night for emergency delivery, when we visit her in the morning for consultations, she will be with the same beautiful smile and positivity. She told us that this time we would hold our baby in our hands and it came true.

She was so particular and conscious enough that there were no chances of uncertainties by closely monitoring the pregnancy at more frequent intervals, giving us much needed moral support and strength, making us stay positive throughout.

Finally, the day arrived. The doctor informed us well in advance about the delivery process, and we were asked to get admitted. I was induced by night and Mam informed the duty doctors to keep monitoring the baby's heartbeat and to inform her about my status, and she assured me if there was any urgency she would be there in 5 mins in hospital. She was frequently checking on my status that night and the next morning, we were blessed with a little angel . In the labor room, she was so supportive. Her words made me feel better when I was in so much pain.

Pregnancy is definitely a smooth journey with a wonderful human being like Dr. Manjula Deepak Mam. I miss visiting Mam in the hospital. She is a very down-to-earth person, and she talks to you like your sister and friend. We can‚Äôt thank Mam enough for all her efforts.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,Wait time,Value for money,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Pregnancy Check Up,Abortion / Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP),Pregnant Women Counseling,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"First of all, I would say a BIG THANK YOU to Manjula mam. She is among the best doctor in Obstetrics and Gynaecology and always tries for a normal delivery unless there is anything serious and does the best possible treatment. I recommend everyone to consult her without a second thought in mind.¬†Once you visit her, you will get to know that you are in a safe¬†and the¬†best hand and will never regret it.¬†

We are blessed with a baby through a normal delivery even after my wife was running on insulin since she got gestational diabetes at the end of 3rd month of pregnancy. I have a long story that I am going to describe¬†below which may be useful for others.

We had consulted Dr. Manjula Deepak first time after the completion of about 3 months of my wife's first pregnancy. Before this, we had consulted two more doctors in Bengaluru but were not satisfied because they¬†were not allowing husbands to talk to the doctor (I understand it was covid time, but still husbands should also meet the doctors), not describing everything in detail, and not answering all the question. We had many questions since it was the first pregnancy. I did google and found Dr. Manjula Deepak with many good reviews and decided to consult her.
Coming to our story, Our first baby was having multiple abnormalities which were identified by Dr. Manjula mam and her team (Dr. Kavyashree KS) at the time of the anomaly scan. It was very shocking for us¬†and hard to believe. But the doctor wanted to have a second opinion before taking any further steps because it was critical and referred us to Bangalore Fetal Medicine Centre (BFMC). We went to BFMC and found there were some patients having similar or another type¬†of criticality in their pregnancy¬†and were referred to BFMC for a second opinion from many well-known hospitals. Doctors in BFMC did an anomaly scan for my wife and they too found the same issue and suggested aborting the baby because it was not easy for the baby to survive in this world or there were high chances to have more complications in the future. BFMC doctors¬†explained the whole thing in more detail and answered all of our questions. We headed back to mam with the BFMC reports and she also suggested abortion and gave us time for a few days to make the final decision. In the meantime, I did some research on google, checked with some other sources, consulted families and friends, etc because it was not easy for us to abort our first baby and finally we decided to go with the doctor's suggestion. My wife got admitted and the doctor did an abortion. I saw the baby and it was the same as presented in the anomaly scan report. It was the most painful day of our life.¬†

We consulted Manjula mam after some days and were worried that will it be similar if we plan for the next child? She told us it happens sometimes and is very rare. She recommended planning for the next baby after three months and don't think much about these things. She gave us enough confidence to plan for the next baby and promised that she will be giving us a healthy baby this time and will take care of everything¬†from the beginning itself.

Good news came after eight or nine months and we consulted with Dr. Manjula mam and did whatever she suggested and continued consulting her. Everything went normal but after the completion of the 3rd month, my wife got Gestational Diabetes and the doctor told us that we should control¬†this until delivery by diet, physical activities, or insulin if required. Else it may impact the growth of the baby. Again we got shocked and trusted the doctor and followed her advice since we got¬†enough faith in her by this time. She referred us to a Dietician and an¬†Endocrinologist to control sugar levels. My wife did the same and was in observation¬†by her, Dietician, and Endocrinologist.¬†

Now the time came for the anomaly¬†scan and we visited the same doctor Kavyashree KS who was aware of our past. We were so much scared and were praying to god at the time of the scan. I thanked a lot¬†to god and the doctors when we got the report and felt very happy,¬†everything¬†was normal. We continued following up with the doctor and Endocrinologist.
At around the 7th month of pregnancy, we moved to another doctor (don't want to name her¬†here,¬†but I will refer to her¬†as ABC) due to some financial issues. Whenever¬†we consulted ABC, she use to give us a lot of tension, used to scare us and never thought about the normal delivery, and always¬†suggested¬†a C section, else there may be a risk for the baby. We continued consulting with ABC up to about the 9th month and were worried about the ABC's words she use to speak at the time of consultation, we were getting sleepless nights.¬†

Finally, we decided to consult Dr. Manjula Deepak again and went to her and explained¬†everything. She was too polite and understood our situation and convinced us that there is¬†nothing to worry about and everything is under control. She told me 95% of the chances are there that she will do a normal delivery and rest upon God (We too agreed here). I told her, mam do whatever you feel the best, I left everything to her and she was the next person after God for us.
Since my wife was on insulin due to Gestational Diabetes, Dr. Manjula mam had to plan delivery before the due date by inducing pain. We planned for this and did accordingly. Delivery was not very easy and that took so much effort from¬†mam's side. She was very calm and active during the whole process. There was a time when even I thought of saying the doctor to go for a C section, but I already had left everything on mam and was knowing that she will be performing her best and finally, we are blessed with a healthy baby. Tears came to my eyes and I thanked a lot¬†Dr. Manjula mam and God for blessing us with the baby.¬†

I am 100% sure that if it was any other doctor, definitely¬†it was done through a C section.

Now I am very happy with my kid and my wife!!! Again credit goes to Dr. Manjula mam!!!",2022-07-23 19:59:26,False,True,Anuj Kumar Chouhan,Thank you very much Anuj for your kind words it means a lot to me,2022-08-21T07:04:17+0000,Dr. Manjula Deepak
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"*** ******* ****** ** *** ** *** **** ************* ** ********** I am so happy that I decided to visit her for my pregnancy. She is very humble, caring, down to earth and would make you feel absolutely comfortable right from the very first visit. I must say, she's super beautiful too. 
My pregnancy journey was quite rough. This was also my first pregnancy. I had severe nausea/vomiting & heartburn since the start of my pregnancy due to which I faced severe gastric problems. Dr. Manjula would always reply to my queries on WatsApp almost immediately.  At times, late in the evening/ night i would require medical attention as I would go through terrible stomach pains. Dr.Manjula would answer my calls every time and patiently guide me. She would also call the duty doctor @cloudnine and instruct as to what needs to be done upon my arrival. 
In my 7th month of pregnancy, i had to face my nightmare. I became Covid19 positive. Words cannot express my fear as to what was going to happen in the coming days. I was so scared of losing my baby, but Dr.Manjula gave me a lot of strength and positivity. Even during those critical times, Dr.Manjula has been a great support to me and my family. She guided me to get admitted to another hospital and was also in constant touch with the doctors there monitoring my medicines. By God's grace I recoverd and my baby was also fine in my womb. 
I was 36 weeks pregnant when my water broke unexpectedly on Dec 2nd 2020 early morning around 3 am. I was very weak after all that i had been through previously. I was prepared for a C-section mentally. Me and my husband rushed to Cloudnine. I was examined and labour was induced at around 4:30 am. I had silently dropped a message on WhatsApp mentioning the situation and that I was there at the hospital. Dr.Manjula was there at the hospital at around 6:30 am. Upon seeing her, there was a sense of relief and i knew she would take care of me & the entire situation. Dr.Manjula and her team were so supportive & encouraging throughout my labour while i screaming and crying in excruciating pain.  I have a very low tolerance to pain. But, I went with the flow and delivered a beautiful girl baby at 1:41 pm Dec 2nd 2020. It was a normal delivery. My baby was born sunny side up. I didnt have faith in me that it was going to be an NVD. In fact no one did even in my family, but Dr.Manjula made it happen. I guess she believed in me. 

Am so glad that God chose Dr.Manjula to be my doctor. I can't thank her enough for giving me my miracle baby in my hands. 
God bless her and her beautiful family. ‚ù§Ô∏è
From the bottom of hearts, Thank You Doctor üòä.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"My wife (Arpita) has been seeing Dr Manjula since April this year from the very beginning of her pregnancy. We got to know about her pregnancy right in the middle of the National Lockdown. My wife was very tense because of the COVID situation at that point in time and we were unsure how things will pan out. We did an online check of various gynecologists and obstetricians across Bangalore on Practo and other websites and came across Dr Manjula‚Äôs profile. We were amazed at her rating (100%) with over 700 reviews. What was also incredible was that almost 80% of those who gave ratings shared their stories. We did not find any other gynecologist across Bangalore who had a 100% rating along with such high number of reviews. Even most of the renowned doctors had 97-98% rating but 100% rating was unheard of. We were quite curious and we decided to visit her, even though the Cloudnine HRBR branch where she is based is relatively far from our place. 
After first few visits, we slowly figured out the reasons for her perfect ratings. Dr Manjula came across as a very friendly, polite and patient person. But the thing that stands out about her is her relaxed attitude. She will put her patients at ease and remove all stress and tension. She does not prescribe any unnecessary tests or medicines and tries her best to ensure that the pregnancy follows a natural path. Throughout the pregnancy, my wife had frequent bouts of nausea and vomiting, but the doctor assured her that it was normal and not to be worried at all. She encourages positivity all the time. My wife had lot of questions (especially since it was her first pregnancy), but the doctor answered all of them patiently. She even gave her watsapp number. My wife used to get her doubts and queries clarified from time to time on watsapp and invariably the doctor would always reply in spite of her busy schedule. 
Couple of more things I would like to mention about Dr Manjula. She remembers all her patients by name (which I find quite incredible given that she would be meeting several new patients every week). Also, she has a very good rapport with her staff. She treats them and talks to them as her equal (just like talking to a friend). This is a rare quality and shows that she is humble, kind and has a great soul. I could see the kind of respect all the staff members had for her. 
In the middle of her pregnancy, my wife was thinking of going to her home town in Kolkata for couple of months. Doctor gave her the go ahead and also provided a fit to fly certificate. After 2 months just before my wife was expected to fly back, we had a discussion of whether the delivery should happen in Kolkata or Bangalore. However, we decided that it was best for her to come back mainly because of the confidence we had in Dr Manjula. After coming back, my wife underwent a CBC test and her hemoglobin came quite low (8.4). Dr Manjula suggested her to take 2 doses of iron infusion. After taking those doses, her hemoglobin went up to 11.2 in a month‚Äôs time. 
During the last scan, my wife was detected with polyhydramnios (very high levels of amniotic fluid) which occurs in just 1% pregnancies. We were quite worried on hearing this but Dr Manjula spent significant amount of time with us, calmed us down and assured us that my wife and our baby were in safe hands and there was nothing to worry. She suggested that we will need to go for Caesarian (because of the polyhydramnios) and it needed to be done within a week. She even gave us the option of choosing the date and time. She clarified all our doubts, laid to rest all our concerns and explained us the entire process of admission and operation. She also assured us that even if there was any emergency at any time before the day of operation, we could just walk in and get admitted and she will come over immediately (Dr Manjula stays just 5 minutes away from the hospital). We went back home satisfied. We chose the date and time of operation and intimated her. 
On 30th Nov on the day of the operation, we reached the hospital early in the morning. All admission formalities were done smoothly and within couple of hours my wife was all set for the operation. In the operation theatre, as my wife was being administered anesthesia, she started sobbing uncontrollably as she got a bit scared. The doctor immediately comforted her and helped her to calm down. Soon she lost consciousness. In the middle of the operation, my wife just remembers hearing the words ‚Äúits a sweet baby girl‚Äù. The operation went smoothly and baby was born healthy. 
When my wife was discharged after 3 days, she had mostly recovered. My wife recovered much faster compared to most people we know of. We believe strongly that this has more to do with the quality of her operation and doctor‚Äôs encouragement to start getting active at the earliest. Dr Manjula called us back after a week, removed the dressing (which had almost healed) and explained to us clearly the way forward. Our next visit is scheduled after 6 months. 
Overall we had an overwhelming experience with Dr Manjula and we would like to thank her from the bottom of our heart for her guidance, advise, encouragement and everything she has done for my wife throughout this period. Most importantly, we would like to thank her for delivering to us the best gift of our life. We will be eternally grateful to her.

I wish to share my experience with Manjula mam. I had a cardiomyopathy issue from my childhood. I got married nd immediately got pregnant. But many doctors advised strictly against pregnancy since it was very risky for my life nd not to continue further. So two times we terminated the baby within 50days of pregnancy. I was very depressed and longing badly for a child in our life. By God's grace we were shifted to Bangalore because of my husband's job nd came to know about Dr.Manjula mam. I got pregnant third time nd visited mam. At the first visit itself she was very positive nd gave us so much confidence nd she was ready to take the risk along with us. She really took all the great efforts to make everything in a very positive nd smooth way nd she referred a cardiologist who is a friend of her. Everything was very smooth throughout out my pregnancy till delivery and finally delivered a baby boy at 37 weeks via c section since it was risky to have a normal delivery. Then after a year we shifted back to our native. I got pregnant again when my son was 1.3yrs old. I was very scared and not in a mentality to visit any doctors there.

 So we immediately called Dr.Manjula mam. We consulted with her virtually till my 5th month but this time it was not a smooth journey. I developed many symptoms like breathlessness, chest pain, high palpitations, etc. So we visited her directly after a long 8hrs journey. But as soon as we met her we got that positivity again in our hearts. Our cardiologist was very upset nd not much happy to continue this pregnancy since my health was not good. But mam gave us lots of hope nd try to get everything positive. She asked us to come at 32 weeks and stay there in Bangalore itself till delivery. She doesn't wish to continue my pregnancy beyond 34 weeks due to my negative ECG nd holter reports. So she asked us to admit immediately at 34 weeks that too not in cloudnine but at the nearby hospital because of the ICU and cardio facilities available there. She literally took more efforts for everything to be very safe nd she was very conscious in arranging all the doctors and procedures in a pre-planned manner. I finally delivered a baby girl at August 17th 2022 but my baby was kept in NICU for 4 days. But with God's grace and Mam's support we were ready to get back to our home. Dr.Manjula mam is really a God sent Angel to us nd we never met such a doctor in our life. She is a true gem of a human being. We love her so much nd am missing her badly. We were longing for one baby but now we are blessed with two both boy and girl. Manjula mam is such a friendly positive energetic smiling doctor. We recommend her 200%. Sorry for the long story. With so much love from Fahima Faizal.",2022-09-16 00:47:14,False,True,Fahima Zanath,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pregnancy Tests,Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Manjula Deepak Mam is definitely a God-sent angel. She carries positive vibes and I would definitely recommend her for any Gynecology consultations. After having two recurrent miscarriages, we were so shattered and lost hope. But it‚Äôs because of her best treatment and true support that we are happy parents to a lovely baby girl.

Here is our story:

It was at the end of 2019, after going through 2 recurrent miscarriages, that we got to know about Dr. Manjula Deepak Mam from a close friend. We immediately booked a consultation and visited her at Cloud Nine HRBR Layout. On our first visit, she looked (that was the only time) at all our history and lab reports, and patiently listened to us. On our next visit, we were surprised to see that she remembered every single piece of information about my history and she ensured that she provided only the best care and treatment.

Then comes COVID in early 2020. We moved to our hometown, gave ourselves a break, and didn't see a doctor for close to a year. We again planned to resume and mentally prepare for pregnancy around mid-2021. We booked an online video consultation with Dr. Manjula Deepak without hesitation, and you wouldn't believe it, even though we connected with her after a year, she remembered every detail and didn't make me feel any less disconnected, and we resumed from where we left off almost a year ago. The doctor helped me with the next set of plans and diets. She deserves a huge amount of respect for her dedication and for being so passionate about her profession and providing personal attention to every single patient.

I was pregnant again and immediately booked the next video consultation with the doctor. Although all this happened virtually, she ensured I was given the best care and attention and prescribed the medicines to get started with.

We moved back to Bangalore in November 2021 for our future consultations and visited the doctor at the hospital. From then on, it was like a big relief and we were so confident that we had got Manjula Deepak Mam with us. Due to previous complications, we used to be nervous whenever there was a scan, and for everything small, I used to message Mam, as I was afraid that something might go wrong. She replied to each and every question on message without any irritation, even though she was always super busy. It was a high-risk pregnancy, but she handled it very smoothly. Mam is always calm and positive, and some days, though she is awake the whole night for emergency delivery, when we visit her in the morning for consultations, she will be with the same beautiful smile and positivity. She told us that this time we would hold our baby in our hands and it came true.

She was so particular and conscious enough that there were no chances of uncertainties by closely monitoring the pregnancy at more frequent intervals, giving us much needed moral support and strength, making us stay positive throughout.

Finally, the day arrived. The doctor informed us well in advance about the delivery process, and we were asked to get admitted. I was induced by night and Mam informed the duty doctors to keep monitoring the baby's heartbeat and to inform her about my status, and she assured me if there was any urgency she would be there in 5 mins in hospital. She was frequently checking on my status that night and the next morning, we were blessed with a little angel . In the labor room, she was so supportive. Her words made me feel better when I was in so much pain.

Pregnancy is definitely a smooth journey with a wonderful human being like Dr. Manjula Deepak Mam. I miss visiting Mam in the hospital. She is a very down-to-earth person, and she talks to you like your sister and friend. We can‚Äôt thank Mam enough for all her efforts.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,Wait time,Value for money,","High-Risk Pregnancy Care,Pregnancy Check Up,Abortion / Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP),Pregnant Women Counseling,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"First of all, I would say a BIG THANK YOU to Manjula mam. She is among the best doctor in Obstetrics and Gynaecology and always tries for a normal delivery unless there is anything serious and does the best possible treatment. I recommend everyone to consult her without a second thought in mind.¬†Once you visit her, you will get to know that you are in a safe¬†and the¬†best hand and will never regret it.¬†

We are blessed with a baby through a normal delivery even after my wife was running on insulin since she got gestational diabetes at the end of 3rd month of pregnancy. I have a long story that I am going to describe¬†below which may be useful for others.

We had consulted Dr. Manjula Deepak first time after the completion of about 3 months of my wife's first pregnancy. Before this, we had consulted two more doctors in Bengaluru but were not satisfied because they¬†were not allowing husbands to talk to the doctor (I understand it was covid time, but still husbands should also meet the doctors), not describing everything in detail, and not answering all the question. We had many questions since it was the first pregnancy. I did google and found Dr. Manjula Deepak with many good reviews and decided to consult her.
Coming to our story, Our first baby was having multiple abnormalities which were identified by Dr. Manjula mam and her team (Dr. Kavyashree KS) at the time of the anomaly scan. It was very shocking for us¬†and hard to believe. But the doctor wanted to have a second opinion before taking any further steps because it was critical and referred us to Bangalore Fetal Medicine Centre (BFMC). We went to BFMC and found there were some patients having similar or another type¬†of criticality in their pregnancy¬†and were referred to BFMC for a second opinion from many well-known hospitals. Doctors in BFMC did an anomaly scan for my wife and they too found the same issue and suggested aborting the baby because it was not easy for the baby to survive in this world or there were high chances to have more complications in the future. BFMC doctors¬†explained the whole thing in more detail and answered all of our questions. We headed back to mam with the BFMC reports and she also suggested abortion and gave us time for a few days to make the final decision. In the meantime, I did some research on google, checked with some other sources, consulted families and friends, etc because it was not easy for us to abort our first baby and finally we decided to go with the doctor's suggestion. My wife got admitted and the doctor did an abortion. I saw the baby and it was the same as presented in the anomaly scan report. It was the most painful day of our life.¬†

We consulted Manjula mam after some days and were worried that will it be similar if we plan for the next child? She told us it happens sometimes and is very rare. She recommended planning for the next baby after three months and don't think much about these things. She gave us enough confidence to plan for the next baby and promised that she will be giving us a healthy baby this time and will take care of everything¬†from the beginning itself.

Good news came after eight or nine months and we consulted with Dr. Manjula mam and did whatever she suggested and continued consulting her. Everything went normal but after the completion of the 3rd month, my wife got Gestational Diabetes and the doctor told us that we should control¬†this until delivery by diet, physical activities, or insulin if required. Else it may impact the growth of the baby. Again we got shocked and trusted the doctor and followed her advice since we got¬†enough faith in her by this time. She referred us to a Dietician and an¬†Endocrinologist to control sugar levels. My wife did the same and was in observation¬†by her, Dietician, and Endocrinologist.¬†

Now the time came for the anomaly¬†scan and we visited the same doctor Kavyashree KS who was aware of our past. We were so much scared and were praying to god at the time of the scan. I thanked a lot¬†to god and the doctors when we got the report and felt very happy,¬†everything¬†was normal. We continued following up with the doctor and Endocrinologist.
At around the 7th month of pregnancy, we moved to another doctor (don't want to name her¬†here,¬†but I will refer to her¬†as ABC) due to some financial issues. Whenever¬†we consulted ABC, she use to give us a lot of tension, used to scare us and never thought about the normal delivery, and always¬†suggested¬†a C section, else there may be a risk for the baby. We continued consulting with ABC up to about the 9th month and were worried about the ABC's words she use to speak at the time of consultation, we were getting sleepless nights.¬†

Finally, we decided to consult Dr. Manjula Deepak again and went to her and explained¬†everything. She was too polite and understood our situation and convinced us that there is¬†nothing to worry about and everything is under control. She told me 95% of the chances are there that she will do a normal delivery and rest upon God (We too agreed here). I told her, mam do whatever you feel the best, I left everything to her and she was the next person after God for us.
Since my wife was on insulin due to Gestational Diabetes, Dr. Manjula mam had to plan delivery before the due date by inducing pain. We planned for this and did accordingly. Delivery was not very easy and that took so much effort from¬†mam's side. She was very calm and active during the whole process. There was a time when even I thought of saying the doctor to go for a C section, but I already had left everything on mam and was knowing that she will be performing her best and finally, we are blessed with a healthy baby. Tears came to my eyes and I thanked a lot¬†Dr. Manjula mam and God for blessing us with the baby.¬†

I am 100% sure that if it was any other doctor, definitely¬†it was done through a C section.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"*** ******* ****** ** *** ** *** **** ************* ** ********** I am so happy that I decided to visit her for my pregnancy. She is very humble, caring, down to earth and would make you feel absolutely comfortable right from the very first visit. I must say, she's super beautiful too. 
My pregnancy journey was quite rough. This was also my first pregnancy. I had severe nausea/vomiting & heartburn since the start of my pregnancy due to which I faced severe gastric problems. Dr. Manjula would always reply to my queries on WatsApp almost immediately.  At times, late in the evening/ night i would require medical attention as I would go through terrible stomach pains. Dr.Manjula would answer my calls every time and patiently guide me. She would also call the duty doctor @cloudnine and instruct as to what needs to be done upon my arrival. 
In my 7th month of pregnancy, i had to face my nightmare. I became Covid19 positive. Words cannot express my fear as to what was going to happen in the coming days. I was so scared of losing my baby, but Dr.Manjula gave me a lot of strength and positivity. Even during those critical times, Dr.Manjula has been a great support to me and my family. She guided me to get admitted to another hospital and was also in constant touch with the doctors there monitoring my medicines. By God's grace I recoverd and my baby was also fine in my womb. 
I was 36 weeks pregnant when my water broke unexpectedly on Dec 2nd 2020 early morning around 3 am. I was very weak after all that i had been through previously. I was prepared for a C-section mentally. Me and my husband rushed to Cloudnine. I was examined and labour was induced at around 4:30 am. I had silently dropped a message on WhatsApp mentioning the situation and that I was there at the hospital. Dr.Manjula was there at the hospital at around 6:30 am. Upon seeing her, there was a sense of relief and i knew she would take care of me & the entire situation. Dr.Manjula and her team were so supportive & encouraging throughout my labour while i screaming and crying in excruciating pain.  I have a very low tolerance to pain. But, I went with the flow and delivered a beautiful girl baby at 1:41 pm Dec 2nd 2020. It was a normal delivery. My baby was born sunny side up. I didnt have faith in me that it was going to be an NVD. In fact no one did even in my family, but Dr.Manjula made it happen. I guess she believed in me. 

Am so glad that God chose Dr.Manjula to be my doctor. I can't thank her enough for giving me my miracle baby in my hands. 
God bless her and her beautiful family. ‚ù§Ô∏è
From the bottom of hearts, Thank You Doctor üòä.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"My wife (Arpita) has been seeing Dr Manjula since April this year from the very beginning of her pregnancy. We got to know about her pregnancy right in the middle of the National Lockdown. My wife was very tense because of the COVID situation at that point in time and we were unsure how things will pan out. We did an online check of various gynecologists and obstetricians across Bangalore on Practo and other websites and came across Dr Manjula‚Äôs profile. We were amazed at her rating (100%) with over 700 reviews. What was also incredible was that almost 80% of those who gave ratings shared their stories. We did not find any other gynecologist across Bangalore who had a 100% rating along with such high number of reviews. Even most of the renowned doctors had 97-98% rating but 100% rating was unheard of. We were quite curious and we decided to visit her, even though the Cloudnine HRBR branch where she is based is relatively far from our place. 
After first few visits, we slowly figured out the reasons for her perfect ratings. Dr Manjula came across as a very friendly, polite and patient person. But the thing that stands out about her is her relaxed attitude. She will put her patients at ease and remove all stress and tension. She does not prescribe any unnecessary tests or medicines and tries her best to ensure that the pregnancy follows a natural path. Throughout the pregnancy, my wife had frequent bouts of nausea and vomiting, but the doctor assured her that it was normal and not to be worried at all. She encourages positivity all the time. My wife had lot of questions (especially since it was her first pregnancy), but the doctor answered all of them patiently. She even gave her watsapp number. My wife used to get her doubts and queries clarified from time to time on watsapp and invariably the doctor would always reply in spite of her busy schedule. 
Couple of more things I would like to mention about Dr Manjula. She remembers all her patients by name (which I find quite incredible given that she would be meeting several new patients every week). Also, she has a very good rapport with her staff. She treats them and talks to them as her equal (just like talking to a friend). This is a rare quality and shows that she is humble, kind and has a great soul. I could see the kind of respect all the staff members had for her. 
In the middle of her pregnancy, my wife was thinking of going to her home town in Kolkata for couple of months. Doctor gave her the go ahead and also provided a fit to fly certificate. After 2 months just before my wife was expected to fly back, we had a discussion of whether the delivery should happen in Kolkata or Bangalore. However, we decided that it was best for her to come back mainly because of the confidence we had in Dr Manjula. After coming back, my wife underwent a CBC test and her hemoglobin came quite low (8.4). Dr Manjula suggested her to take 2 doses of iron infusion. After taking those doses, her hemoglobin went up to 11.2 in a month‚Äôs time. 
During the last scan, my wife was detected with polyhydramnios (very high levels of amniotic fluid) which occurs in just 1% pregnancies. We were quite worried on hearing this but Dr Manjula spent significant amount of time with us, calmed us down and assured us that my wife and our baby were in safe hands and there was nothing to worry. She suggested that we will need to go for Caesarian (because of the polyhydramnios) and it needed to be done within a week. She even gave us the option of choosing the date and time. She clarified all our doubts, laid to rest all our concerns and explained us the entire process of admission and operation. She also assured us that even if there was any emergency at any time before the day of operation, we could just walk in and get admitted and she will come over immediately (Dr Manjula stays just 5 minutes away from the hospital). We went back home satisfied. We chose the date and time of operation and intimated her. 
On 30th Nov on the day of the operation, we reached the hospital early in the morning. All admission formalities were done smoothly and within couple of hours my wife was all set for the operation. In the operation theatre, as my wife was being administered anesthesia, she started sobbing uncontrollably as she got a bit scared. The doctor immediately comforted her and helped her to calm down. Soon she lost consciousness. In the middle of the operation, my wife just remembers hearing the words ‚Äúits a sweet baby girl‚Äù. The operation went smoothly and baby was born healthy. 
When my wife was discharged after 3 days, she had mostly recovered. My wife recovered much faster compared to most people we know of. We believe strongly that this has more to do with the quality of her operation and doctor‚Äôs encouragement to start getting active at the earliest. Dr Manjula called us back after a week, removed the dressing (which had almost healed) and explained to us clearly the way forward. Our next visit is scheduled after 6 months. 
Overall we had an overwhelming experience with Dr Manjula and we would like to thank her from the bottom of our heart for her guidance, advise, encouragement and everything she has done for my wife throughout this period. Most importantly, we would like to thank her for delivering to us the best gift of our life. We will be eternally grateful to her.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,Normal Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Dr Manjula Ma'm is an awesome human being, she treat everyone with so much friendliness. 
Having lot of experience *** ************* ******* she never shown that attitude of we are patients and she is doctor, she has zero attitude :)

Here is our story, (in another hospital & different doctor) we blessed with our first baby in 2016 and the C-section delivery experience was horrible . With that we almost in depression few yrs., not even thought to plan another baby coz of fearing we may land in same situation again.  

From last few years we keep looking the reviews for best gynecologist‚Äôs and hospitals in Bangalore, finally we got to know about the Dr Manjula Ma'm and her positive feedbacks. we almost read about her all the reviews in google and practo, surprised to see 900 plus positive comments and everyone has different problems but still they happy with Manjula Ma'm treatment. For us time came to visit Manjula Ma'm in 2021 October and the first consultation experience was good.  

She don‚Äôt prescribe un necessary medicines or scans, she give lot of time to clarify all the doubts. We were having small issue during 7th month pregnancy and we are lucky enough to have Manjula Ma'm and she treated well in advance and everything went well. Being busy doctor, still she always available over the whatsapp/phone call and clarify even small query/concerns.

Having C-section first time, still Ma'm was positive for Normal on 2nd delivery and waited till 38th week to see if Normal is possible. We are lucky enough to start small contractions at 37W 6d early morning and informed Ma'm about the situation and she suggested to wait till afternoon and visit hospital (Ma'm was on Sick leave that day 26th May). Here is the situation shows how dedicated about her patients and profession, Ma'm was having some surgery for her throat on same day and she couldn't talk next 2 weeks of time :( and she discharged from hospital that day evening around 5.30PM. but still in that situation Ma'm came to hospital to see my wife around 8.30PM night and given great support (we worried after hearing her surgery and in that situation, what if another doctor attend how they treat and all. she has talked with her assistant doctor and asked her to wait till night and make sure we feel comfortable for safe delivery). she couldn't talk having surgery(it was one way communication and she clarified our quires on writing paper :) ) and still everything she was writing up on paper and prescribed what should do for that night and early morning. i don‚Äôt think any other doctor will available like this for patients especially when they have surgery for throat and situation where she can‚Äôt even talk anything. We are very thank full for dr Manjula Ma'm great support on that day.

After almost 28 hours of painful contractions, On the next day morning (27th May) the time came for delivery. They shifted to labor room and Ma'm was taking fluids in other room (Might be she couldn‚Äôt swallow food due to surgery) and attended for Normal delivery at 9.32 AM :)  Me and My wife very much Thankful for Ma'm Great support and we would like to share about Manjula Ma'm to our baby when she grown enough to understand it :)

Whoever looking for best gynecologists, blindly you can go ahead with Dr Manjula and follow her instructions. You will be in very safe hands and will experience smooth delivery process.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,","Normal Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Wonder Woman

Wonder Woman 1984 movie was released in May 2021. It is a good movie. The movie, for those who have not seen it, is about a fictional DC character Diana Prince, An Amazonian with super natural powers and who saves the world. For us, real life Wonder Woman is, Dr. Manjula Deepak.

We are parents of 2 daughters (Vismaya and Vinyasa) both delivered by Dr. Manjula Deepak. 2 normal deliveries and we are 2 happy and grateful parents who want to share our experience so that others can just enjoy the parenthood and not worry about anything else in the world.

Dr. Manjula Deepak is real life Wonder woman. We don't have enough words to describe how grateful we are to Dr. Manjula. Both of our daughters were delivered by Dr. Manjula in Cloud 9 HRBR Layout. First one in March 2019 and second one during COVID times May 2021.

When you are about to become parents for the first time, you have a lot of questions, some fears; what would happen if the water broke at midnight to is our baby doing well, is mother eating properly to why is baby not kicking from last 2-3 days, what to eat and what exercises to do during these days; what to expect during the delivery. You will get all the answers and more. She is extremely patient and listens to you and helps out even to internet/google research parents, which we were :). She is so friendly that you would be quite comfortable. She always has a smile which puts you at ease and you feel like she is a family member.

Our first baby,
She accommodated consultation timings as we were travelling from Electronic City to HRBR layout; sometimes 2 hours of travel in Bangalore traffic but we didn't want any other doctor. She suggested exercise, medicine, diet changes which we followed religiously. She also answered our queries on WhatsApp. The delivery was induced as babies growth was sufficient and normal delivery would be tricky if we waited more. The water broke in mid-night. We called Dr. Manjula and she immediately picked the call at 2AM! She said don't worry, just come. We felt so comfortable, although the labour was 9 hours, she was there to reassure that it is going to be fine. She wanted us to have normal delivery and it was. We delivered a healthy baby weighing 2.8 kgs.

Our second baby, it was during COVID-19 Wave 2,
We both tested positive for COVID-19 in 8th month of pregnancy, the consultations, scans were difficult as the COVID protocol won't let the husbands along in the scan room and our first daughter would cry thinking the doctors are doing something to mom. The second delivery was also planned. Although the labour was 12 hours, we delivered normally, a healthy baby weighing 3.2 kgs.
After the delivery, when we come back to senses, she visits you and takes selfies with tired but happy parents!

She is super busy as everyone wants time from her, but she makes sure you get enough attention and care.
She probably would skip lunch for your appointments and for deliveries which can happen in middle of lunches.
She would skip sleeping at night but makes sure she is available when you need her for the delivery in middle of the night with a big smile. You and I can probably do this for a week or so, but to do this every day and every night is super human thing. she is a great doctor and a great human being.


About the hospital where she consults, Cloud 9 HRBR:
- The canteen food is excellent. Might not get your favourite smoothies but the fruit juices are healthy; you might not get chicken biriyani but the meals are filling, neatly prepared, hygienic and healthy. Canteen staff are very courteous.
- Some of the nurses might be new and less experienced but they are quite helpful, senior nurses are definitely knowledgeable and kind.
- The rooms are clean and well maintained, they have proper ACs, bathrooms and sufficient space for baby and parents.
- The Bangalore traffic could be bad to reach the hospital due to one ways and road repairs but as deliveries were planned, we didn't have this issue. Parking is nice.

One would have more babies if the delivery is this smooth. If words only could express how much gratitude we feel for Dr. Manjula Deepak, we would have written a book. There aren't enough stars to rate her .... seriously she is Wonder woman.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"My storytime was long pending. I conceived way back in April 2016 and there was no HBR cloud nine then it was only Cloudnine clinic at Kammanhalli. when I missed my periods I rushed to cloud nine clinics was my test result was positive. I had no lead in terms of doctor I checked with the staff of cloud nine and they immediately suggested a Doctor who was available then that was the start point of my nightmare, during my first visit I asked her about do's and dont's and never got any answer I felt lost, I had morning sickness or 24/7 throwing up sickness for the first couple of months one of such days when I was throwing up rigorously I started coughing blood and when I tried reaching the doctor through Clinic she never spoke to me but gave instructions even without listening to me properly. When i went again for my visit i had lost considerable amount of weight which is not good during pregnancy and i was put on alternate days vitamins injection which was painful, somehow i go through this as well and reached my next check up by then there was no improvement in my weight instead it had gone from bad to worse, I was put another rounds of injections which was 2 times a day for a week, On third day when the doc in my area was not able to find the nerve to poke injection i went back to clinic which was on a weekday, nurse there felt bad looking at my condition and referred DR MANJULA DEEPAK my saviour my god i would say she was very polite when i met her and her first question to me was if i were comfortable to converse in Kannada and I was more than happy to articulate my feeling my questions my fears in my language i was asked immediately to stop those injections and she told me just eat regular home made food and you will be fine and apart from the regular Iron and calciums pills no other medicines are required and from then till my delivery i would always be excited to meet Doctor Manjula like a kid she would listen to me with all patience in the world. I would generally take the first appointment of the day and later go to work from there on one such instance during my appointment it was a working day and I had my appointment a little later than my regular day and she asked if I had off and I told her my team is on offsite she looked from my file and asked why didn't you go? I was like isn't it obvious she told me YOU ARE PREGNANT, NOT PATIENT. She had given her number in case of emergency, While my pregnancy journey with Doctor Manjula was great after my delivery at Cloudnine Malleswaram my son had miconium aspiration and he was in NICU for 10 days his lungs had collapsed and during this time though Dr Manjula had given discharge clearance her duty ended but she would visit me every other day from Cloudnine old airport road or after her consulting time in Cloudnine Kammanhalli even if there were no delivery for her in Malleswaram Unit on that particular day one of those days i felt extremely emotional seeing everyone coming for delivery and leaving within a day or 2 with their babies and here i was crying looking at my baby attached with tubes, I called her started crying over the phone she consoled me around 12:30 in the midnight she comes to my ward after finishing a delivery at airport road because i was feeling low i never felt so touched, she personally went to NICU checked all the reports of my baby and made me understand what is the progress in layman term and tells me tomorrow hopefully they should call you to breastfeed the baby and next day i get call around afternoon asking to come over for feeding my baby was tubes free.. she visited me every alternative days till i was in the hospital for almost 10+ days and helped me recover mentally ... I am getting emotional as i type this today if my son is happy and healthy the entire credit goes to my doctor Manjula Deepak and its just not this a year or 2 back i had UTI at middle of night and i was in not town i was at night somewhere pain was unbearable i didn't know if she would remember me i called her she picked my phone saying "" Hey Ramya how are you ?"" that was my first relief and immediately i told her this she suggested few medicines i went in search of a pharmacy and got the medicine n survived that night just before COVID I suddenly spotted blood in my panty soon after my periods days and i was tensed ( thanks to the google symptoms) i like always called her and she calmly told me stop over thinking and if you still not convinced come over to meet me i ran for my life and there she told me the reason for it and took me to scan room herself and was present the entire time holding my hand ... THIS IS HER... nicest most humble and down to earth person, I wish i can imbibe few of her qualities...

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnant,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"We have only good things to say about Dr. Manjula Deepak. we started consulting her from our 2nd trimester and right from the start we thought this doc is exactly who we wanted. Reasons are simple and I would like to specifically call it out as below and rate it for those who are now in a similar situation like how we were when we really wanted the best doc for us.

¬∑        Friendliness: my rating is 5 out of 5

One of the friendliest doc we have come across. She has this knack of easing out the pressure and stress with you generally would associate with during pregnancy. She makes you feel comfortable and the consultations are generally fun.

 

¬∑        Professionalism, Treatment: my rating is 5 out of 5

We found her a thorough professional and always available for the patients. She always quickly understood or diagnosed issues things became so much easy for us and we were confident that come what may, she is going to find a solution. There are specific things that happened and we were quite worried and had even gone to a couple of docs who we thought would be able to help and this was after the delivery, but then we finally decided to go back to Dr Manjula and like a snap of your fingers she diagnosed the issue and gave a solution. She believes in prescribing very minimum medicines and we were very happy with that too. One point I would like to specially mention is that I found her ability to remember names of everyone she meets is amazing and she makes it a point to stop and talk to all her patients whenever and wherever she meets them in the premises and correctly addresses everyone by their name. She might be really stressed out after her night shifts and multiple procedures but it never really shows up on her face when she meets you.

 

¬∑        Accessibility: 5 out of 5

During your pregnancy, you would really want someone to be reachable 24/7 and for the smallest and silliest of things. Dr Manjula is just a msg or phone call away and that is so comforting and definitely made things really smooth and easy for us

 

¬∑        Cost: 4 out of 5

The cost bit, I am rating 4 as I quite didn‚Äôt agree with the increase in consulting fees by Cloudtail during Covid. I understand the costs were increased to accommodate the additional expenses the hospital needs to bear for the various kits that is supposedly needed by the doctors to meet the patients.

 

Overall, we would give a 5 out of 5 to Dr Manjula Deepak and would definitely and certainly recommend her to anyone who is looking to have a good pregnancy and delivery experience. We were lucky enough to have found her",2021-09-16 10:03:09,False,True,Thomas,Thank you very much Thomas for those kind words it means a lot to me,2021-09-22T03:29:48+0000,Dr. Manjula Deepak
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"We ( Jeshma & Sunil) visited Dr. Manjula Deepak for pregnancy checkup at Cloudnine (HRBR Layout Branch) after going through the reviews of couple of doctors online and were delighted & confident on our choice the very first day we met her. Yes, her energetic, positive & consoling nature will not allow anyone to look for an alternative for pregnancy needs throughout their life. Our very first consultation with her for ~10-15 min left us talking about her commendable qualities for the rest of the day. I personally love her calling my Wife's name (Jeshmaa....) which will give you a friendly feel even before getting into her cabin for consultation. She was clear & precise in conveying my Wife's pregnancy status from time to time and was appreciating my wife for maintaining her health & weight pretty consistently although you can find her being strict at times when you end up showing some variance in the expected numbers. Our consultation with her throughout my Wife's pregnancy was very positive & promising. Despite having all the conditions in our favor for normal delivery until the 37th week, the doctor wasn't happy about her pelvis type which hinted the fact that we should be prepared to go for C-section if normal isn't possible due to the suspected issue.

However, when we hit the big day (D-day), it was a great & out of the world experience to us. My wife started getting light pain around 12:45AM and eventually it increased and had to admit her in the hospital at 6:30AM. They induced labor around 7:30AM and asked us to wait until 11:30AM after which the doctor inspected the condition and noticed that the baby has passed motion so wanted to speed up the delivery process but my Wife was not fully dilated yet and she couldn't bear the pain anymore. That's when the doctor played her role very decisively by talking to me personally and stating that everything is on-track & going great than expected. The only demand from her side was to convince my wife to bear the pain for another 60-90 min in order to have normal delivery & she made her team to continuously monitor the baby's heartbeat & was waiting for the right time for normal delivery. Finally, she was fully dilated within 90 min and the doctor with her entire labor team did a great job by delivering the baby successfully through normal delivery process after which I couldn't resist myself from giving the doctor a big hug.

Overall, Dr. Manjula Deepak is a god sent angel for us who did all that she can do to deliver our cute little angel through the normal delivery process. All the preparation, pain & efforts paid off and we reveled in the miracle of birth. Thanks a lot to the doctor and her entire crew who played their role meticulously to make our baby's birth an unforgettable experience. We will certainly recommend Dr. Manjula Deepak & the Cloudnine hospital for all sort of pregnancy & maternity needs.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"We were so happy when we knew that my wife was Pregnant, we were excited and scared at the same time as it was her first pregnancy. 

As a couple we had a huge list of recommendations from friends and relatives about various doctors we could consult. 

Our first and foremost requirement at the time was to find a warm and caring doctor that we were comfortable with. 

One by one we visited 7 doctors (some with an Attitude, some with a prescription for various scans within 2min of meeting and also from a particular Lab and a Particular Technician, some wouldn‚Äôt allow the Husband in the consulting room, some speak only Medical jargons makes it so difficult to follow, some scare you that its going to be a caesarean on the first visit) and finally we met Dr Manjula Deepak.

After the first interaction with Dr Manjula my wife was so happy and so excited and was so confident in saying that she is going to be our doctor, though the Hospital was never on our list (it was on the higher end ‚Çπ compared to other Hospitals), the whole day I just heard from my wife that the doctor was like this, like that, she told this, she said don‚Äôt worry, she was not in a hurry, she answered all my queries etc‚Ä¶

When you meet Dr Manjula, she is full of Energy, Positivity, Compassionate, Warm, speaks to you in the most humble and simplified manner, like speaking to a child. What one expects from a doctor apart for their expertise is that feel, that when u meet a doctor that everything is going to be fine, she will be there when you need her, she will comfort you when you are in pain, she will move any obstacles in your way, and all you have to do is rest your faith in her hands.

We have never felt that a scan was prescribed unnecessarily, that a Blood test was prescribed unnecessarily, that a medicine was prescribed unnecessarily. She has always ensured that only the required Treatment was provided.

She was available on the phone whenever you have a query (big or small), though she is almost always the busiest doctor in the Hospital 24x7 (Consult her once and you will know what i mean).

On the Final day we were at the Hospital at 10pm in the LDR, by then Dr Manjula had instructed the fellow doctors about the next steps, she visited us at 11 in the night (prior to this we only met her in the morning) and comforted us and mentioned we had time and that she will be back the next morning at 7am. We were waiting in the room that night, Dr Manjula comes in the room at 4am she happened to be there as another patient of hers delivered, she was there to check and left after sometime, only to return at 6 am to again check on us, this time we were worried, as my wife wasn‚Äôt responding to the Treatment, she politely told us to wait till 9 am. And then she returned and still my wife wasn‚Äôt responding to the Treatment, they tried inducing pain but it was all but clear that we have to prepare ourselves for a caesarean, we had time only till 1pm for a Normal delivery. So we waited and suddenly at 12 the doctors hurried to the room, called Dr Manjula, it was time, all the doctors encouraged, cajoled, reminded that it was all in my wife‚Äôs hands for a Normal delivery. Can still hear Dr Manjula shouting that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do a caesarean, you had come to me months ago asking for a Normal delivery, now you need to push, you are so close, please push‚Äù.

It‚Äôs a boy, he was delivered normally. It was an ordeal for us for almost 14 hours but all through, Dr Manjula was right there‚Ä¶

She was there every step of the way till the most crucial time, supporting, helping, guiding and by the Grace of God we have Dr Manjula as our Doctor. As a Husband a brother a friend and a fellow human being I would always recommend that you get a doctor as good as Doctor Manjula Deepak‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"My husband and I was pregnant with our first child. We researched for a good gynecologist and came across Dr Manjula's profile in practo. With all the good stories shared we decided to consult her and I would say that was the best decision we made for our pregnancy journey.

She has a very charismatic personality with full of energy and positive attitude. In our first visit, being a first timer, we had a lot of questions. To our surprise we got answers to all of them without asking. This shows her rich experience in dealing with the subject where she understands the mindset of new going to be parents. And the same happened in our every visit. She gave all the information required for the time without we worrying to ask. And she was always available on whatsapp for any emergency query.
Another thing which was very impressive about her was that she doesn‚Äôt prescribes any fancy procedure or medicine. She suggests all the natural ways and procedures, natural homely remedies , homely supplements etc. On the medicine front too, i was never loaded with a lot of tests and tablets. I had a very smooth and happy pregnancy. 
There was a point where we were thoughts of going to our hometown for helping hands during COVID. But it was just and just for the doctor and our confidence on her that we stayed back. And we are very happy with our decision.
We wanted NVD and again it was for the doctor that we were able to achieve it. My labor was long where at a point we broke down and was thinking of going for C-section. But doctor Manjula showed high confidence and kept convincing us to wait for a little longer. Finally, i delivered a healthy baby normally. She supported me though post delivery period too where i was very nervous about recovery of my mind and body. 
Her AURA is magical. Meeting her always made me happy even in my lowest of mood a 5-minute chat with her made me relaxed and feel better.
During COVID where cloudnine only allows one parent to enter the hospital/doctor's cabin , she made sure my husband was involved equally in the journey. She spoke to my husband over phone/virtually in our every visit and kept him updated with all the progress our baby was making. 
A great doctor, a beautiful soul and above all a great human being. I highly highly appreciate and recommend her. She is a full package of great subject expertise and amazing consulting skills, she was everything I wanted from my gynecologist. 
Doctor Manjula, may you always be super gorgeous, super fit and kicking . You will always stay in my heart. God bless you !!

As this was my first pregnancy I was unsure whom to consult. I'm still not sure of these reviews are true or are all false. When I met her as a person she was really nice to talk , she kept a smile on her face and answered all the queries. All my reports were normal . She advised me with few exercise for having normal delivery and I religiously abide by her instructions. I was very happy thinking my doctor understands me and she is also trying for normal delivery.  I was very close to my due date which was on 10th of Feb but unfortunately  I did not get my labour , I became very worried and went to doctor. I was asked to do a scan to check the water level and to see if everything was fine. Thankfully everything came as normal. I checked with the doctor if she can induce but she refused and asked me to relax and go home and wait for the normal labour. I waited and waited for the normal labour  but unfortunately It did not happen, but I made sure basis on the dates given by the doctor I visited her with no fail. Now I was 42 weeks pregnant. Every one was worried home because according to them it was very late but thankfully doctor Manjula Deepak gave me the confidence nothing to worry. Finally I got a little pain and decided to admit in the hospital (cloud nine) at night 6 pm on Sunday while she was feeding her babies. She asked me to leave and get admited on Monday as on Sunday there are only limited staff. As I was very worried because of my past due date I became reluctant to go back.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"I could plan a second child just to be under Dr. Manjula Deepak's care! :)  I think this gives you an absolutely clear idea of my trust, respect and admiration for this passionate and highly experienced individual. You will see the same respect in the eyes of the people who work with her too.

I met Dr. Manjula Deepak at Cloudnine Hospital in HRBR when I was 4 weeks pregnant and was recommended by a friend ( PS: she is extremely popular amongst her past patients and rightly so.).

My first consultation with Dr. Manjula Deepak allowed me to experience her positive and energetic nature. She is so passionate and thorough that she remembers more about you than you do about your own case. She understands the anxiety levels of the mom-to-be and responds on messages for any queries. 

I remember, I had a dicey first trimester which made me really anxious, low and under-confident but every time I would meet doctor she gave me so much confidence and hope. Most importantly, I always wanted to have a normal delivery and when I was 3 cm dilated, doctor sat me and my husband down to explain the process of delivery and comforted us. She patiently waited and encouraged me for a normal delivery till the end (yes, through 12 hours of labor!), she ensured that I was absolutely comfortable during the labor and took precious time from her busy schedule to bring our baby into this world via normal delivery.

I still remember what she told me when I was 10 weeks pregnant ‚Äì ‚ÄúI will give you a baby, don‚Äôt worry‚Äù and boy she did :) We were blessed with a baby boy this May, filling our life with abundance and happiness for which we are extremely grateful to her..

One thing I absolutely love about her is she is very honest and tells you like it is. During my pregnancy, she encouraged me to have a healthy weight gain (which most doctors don‚Äôt really care about much) and whenever I would waiver from the track set for me by the nutritionist she would tell me that its not going to help me or my goal of normal delivery and kept me focused.  Thanks to her advice and encouragement I am already 2 kgs away from my pre-pregnancy weight, Yay!

Finally, she is someone I look upto as her passion is infectious and something we could all imbibe. Every time I cross cloud nine or go to cloud nine for my baby‚Äôs consultation, my eyes keep searching for her. She still remembers my name even after all this time and always offers her warm smile and banter whenever I greet her. She is an amazing human being and an extra ordinary doctor in this field where most are looking to mint money! 

I highly highly recommend Dr. Manjula Deepak if you are looking to bring a little one into your lives :)

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"Me and my wife are writing this review with a deep gratitude in our heart for Dr Manjula Deepak for her support and guidance throughout the pregnancy journey. 

We were consulting a different Gynec initially and we had an emergency, but did not get a satisfying response when we wanted an advise. So, I did reach out to my close friend who were also expecting a baby for his suggestion for a good Gynec. He referred us to Dr Manjua Deepak and that‚Äôs where our journey started, which turned out to be an amazing decision of choosing her. I am so thankful to my friend too for doing so. 

Am sure, this review will help many such couples who can just walk up to Dr Manjula without any second thought and they will have a similar experience.

1.	Firstly, she is so friendly that at your first visit you feel so comfortable. She listen to your problems and comforts us by assuring that the problem is handled at ease, which is an amazing quality as a Doctor

2.	From the first visit itself we had gained confidence that we felt we are in safe hands

3.	My wife had to undergo a Cyst surgery when she was in her start of 3rd month of pregnancy and we both were so tensed but she had assured everything to be fine with the baby and rightly by the grace of god everything was fine

4.	We were always given a heads-up on upcoming symptoms/ body changes which helped my wife to be mentally ready

5.	Whatever the Scan reports say, she has never created a panic mode in us, which is so great of her

6.	She was available on WhatsApp for any kind of emergency (Suggest not to message a Doctor unless it is an emergency)

7.	My wife preferred a normal delivery, but due to situation we ended up deciding for C-section a day before she delivered. But Dr Manjula just walked up to the Labour room that night and comforted and gave assurance for a normal delivery irrespective of the situation which made us to re-think on our decision and agreed for Normal delivery. She proved that she was right which made us so happy

8.	Our baby was early by 5 weeks, doctor had to deliver the baby at 34 weeks. It was not a surprise for us, as doctor had hinted this right from 5th month of pregnancy and was monitoring closely. We were in a much better position because of her positivity and assurance. 

9.	It was such a great feeling to see my baby next to my wife within an hour of delivery

10.	Never seen a doctor be so committed towards their patients 

Words fall short enough to appreciate the service you do. You have been a great human being first and doctor next. Thank you for all your service, you will be remembered always by both of us and our family. Wishing you greater heights and success in your carrier :-)

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pre-Pregnancy Counselling,",0,0,YES,"This comes a little late but here is my note of my journey with Dr. Manjula Deepak. I thank God for having given me the best doctor who like an angel so wonderfully saw me through the whole process of having a baby. Dr. Manjula was my second doctor whom I consulted for my cyst and enquire about having a baby as my husband and I were planning for a baby. My husband and I had planned to meet another doctor in the same hospital but by Gods grace we got directed to meet Dr. Manjula. Initially I was very nervous and skeptical about our first visit. Meeting her in person instantly made us feel so welcomed and the conversation was so friendly and yet professional. Talking to her about my condition and the concerns I had was so comfortable, I felt for the first time that someone truly heard me out and understood my condition. The counseling she offered encouraged us and made us feel so optimistic about having a baby very soon despite my cyst. I truly enjoyed my follow up visits, doctor was so friendly and taught me to take things positively and to enjoy the process and assured me time and again not to worry. Those visits truly boosted my spirit and lifted hopes up. By the end of my third follow up checkup I had totally forgotten about my cyst condition because I that hopeful and knew I was heading in the right direction to having a baby. Per her guidance and medication, I began to follow them strictly. Dr. Manjula assured that within 3 months I can get conceived and per her word I got conceived with my first baby. Post pregnancy, we had timely and meaningful visits and through the process doctor took time to explain each phase of my pregnancy and kept us informed about our babys growth. Her medications and guidance was more than sufficient for both me and the baby. What I really appreciate is the passion Dr. Manjula has in her job, not many doctors come forward like her to go the extra mile to assure wellness of both the mother and the baby. I felt so secure and safe through every phase. Even if I couldnt consult face to face, she was always reachable over WhatsApp or phone call to enquire any concerns or recommend medication. Eventually in my visits to Dr. Manjula, I became so accustomed, we would wait to meet her again. Despite her busy schedule she is so hospitable and knows how to accommodate her patients and always treated us with so much respect and care. She kept us informed of what was upcoming and how I should respond to them, by that I was never too anxious for anything in the process. Some of the nurses also mentioned about how Dr. Manjula was looking forward to meet me and kept a tab on how I was doing. Even at the point of delivery, she took so much care that she even was willing to deliver my baby separately. She helped me to be prepared mentally and physically for what was going to happen during delivery. She ensures that both of us as husband and wife are present and kept my husband informed of how he can aid and support me. She took the time to be there to induce the pain for me herself and promised me that 99% everything is going to be good and we neednt worry. Doctor told that I should deliver the baby between 4am to 7am, but by Gods grace my baby started to come earlier. I was so surprised and felt so safe that at a moments notice she came over and had my baby delivered safely at 2.43am. God helped me deliver a beautiful baby boy. Both my husband and I and our families are filled with so much of joy and have a deep respect for our doctor simply because of the way we were calm and confident as Dr. Manjula always encouraged and helped us be confidant in everything, every concern we might have she clarified it right away and never was tired with our questions . I really hope and pray that many more doctors like Dr. Manjula will rise and be a blessing to many individuals and their families. I would recommend no other doctor but Dr. Manjula, I am totally confident that she will do her best to instill hope in mothers like me and help them bring up a baby. What I looked for the most was to have a normal delivery and not go for cesarean, Dr. Manjula stands for normal delivery and only when it is unavoidable she goes for cesarean. Dr. Manjula right from the start prepared us mentally and always pushed us to go for normal despite the pain. We need doctors like this, as cesarean might ease the pain at the moment but women suffer with back pain lifelong. Dr. Manjula ensured we have a normal delivery and I am so happy today that God sent us such a wonderful doctor. I recommend Dr. Manjula at Cloudnine Hospital HRBR layout. Just one appointment with her and I assure you will not be disappointed. Truly words cannot contain the gratitude I have for Dr. Manjula but I will always remember her and her family in my prayers and always be grateful to her. Thank you Dr. Manjula for your amazing service, truly you are the best in your job! I will miss the regular visits, hopefully will see you soon for our second baby. Thank you so much Dr. Manjula.

Thanks to Dr. Manjula for her demonstration of due diligence and her guidance towards our successful and most memorable phase of attaining parenthood. We are now blessed with twin baby boys both in their best of health and weight. She is awesome as a doctor, especially in placing the right focus on each of her patients. Surprisingly, as not to be seen in most of the doctors, she diligently remembers each detail of the health conditions of her patients, their medications, their allergies and follow-up dates, etc. Apart from a great doctor, Dr. Manjula is a great soul as well who aims at serving the society with her best possible efforts and capacity. She is right there when there is a need may it be any part of the  midnight or day time. Really perplexed to see the way she manages between her consultations and delivery cases effectively without injustice to either. She visits the scan rooms personally many times to ensure proper understanding on the case. Also, I would not forget mentioning the way she explains and encourages her patients to make them aware of some of the treatments/procedures like cervical encirclage etc and helps take right decisions during the course of pregnancy - Only to ensure the best for her patients.  This, to a great extent helps towards the very high success rates that she delivers. Another great thing that we have noticed in Dr. Manjula 
 is the result-oriented & efficient planning that she does. I am grateful to the Almighty God that he connected us with this awesome doctor. She is also available on messaging apps/platforms for quick doubts/clarifications, which is one of the greatest assets of consulting with her.

Overall, I would definitely suggest/insist my friends/colleagues to Dr. Manjula Deepak without a second choice !

Along with Dr. Manju Deepak, I am thankful to cloudnine & the staff who stood with us in every step to ensure that we achieve parent-hood gracefully !!

Hi all,
We visited Manjula mam after 3 abortions, which used to happen within 2‚Äì3 months of conceiving. We went with our friend's reference, but we were having not even 10% of confidence of giving birth to a child, but she has (Manjula Mam). 
First thing she did was cutting off all overdosed medicines which my wife use to take (obviously suggested by other doctors) and bring down it to one tablet that is Folic. Guess what, very next month my wife conceived naturally without any external medical aid.
We went to Manjula madam, and she was very cautious at our initial stages till we complete 3 months. But let me tell you one thing, there were no extra medicines given to my wife except madam giving us confidence (She used to tell us nothing is going to happen until she is there for us).
Yes, Finally we completed 38 Weeks, that too without any overdosed medicines and steroids.
Guess what, My wife gave birth to a beautiful little angel on March 3rd which we never expected in our dreams also.(That too normal delivery)
The best part about Manjula madam is she is confident and very patient to listen to you, at the same time she expects you to listen to her and follow what she says. 
Sometimes she might be rude when you gain extra weight or when you increase your blood sugar level, but this is all about her concern about you.
She prefers doing normal delivery and never ever force you, or you force her for C-Section (My wife bore 12 Hours of labor pain, but Madam was very confident that she is going to make it as normal one, now we are realizing the Importance of normal delivery in our postnatal).
Finally, I can say thanks to madam for making us parents which we never dreamed of.",2023-05-26 12:41:58,False,True,Naresha Vasudev,,,

I can say this because I felt it during delivery, I could see myself progress through the highest pain in a womans' life with ease and all this because doctor was by my side reassuring me of the remarkable progess I was making and motivating me to keep calm and stay relaxed through the whole process of normal delivery.

She is a positive soul with a beautiful smile. She is humble, energetic, extremely down to earth, very caring and friendly person.
A great Doctor like her doesn't need any feedback. Below are the experiences that we had during the 9 months of Pregnancy.

Thanks to the Practo for the great reviews , we decided to visit Cloudnine HRBR to consult Dr. Manjula (Assuming we can utilize our Health Insurance with Cloudnine)

We visited her for Pregancy consultation as my wife had Chronic Hypertension (High BP) prior pregnancy as well , Initially I was
very scared due to my wife health problems , child should not have any impact.

From the very first day of consultation we were guided towards the right direction & later we felt very secured and confident
that we are in the right hand. My wife pregnancy was not a cake walk for her as she had a lots of complications in the second half of pregnancy
but we never lost hope because of Mam (Dr. Manjula Deepak). Whenever we used to see her face my wife used to feel relaxed (Looking at her whatsup DP as well :).

We used to believe ""now Mam is here and she will do what is best for us"". We used to wait eagerly for our visit so that we can meet her 
because we always used to get a positive energy after meeting her, my mind used to get relaxed when we stepped out of her chamber. 
Whenever she had any health issues through out her pregnancy mam was always available on whatsup and responded immediately to the queries. 

One thing what we understood is that one has to trust her when being treated by her and then you are in the best hands. She is very friendly and understands the issue. (Remember our insurance provider was not covered under Cloudnine HRBR which we knew during the 1st month 
and still went ahead with consultation as we knew we are in a great hand.. God bless Manjula for getting our Smile and Mojo Back)

We got blessed with a baby Boy and he is of 2 weeks. 
Thank you Mam for all your support. 
We will always pray to Almighty for your well-being.

It was one of the best decisions of our life.
Not only did Dr. Manjula meet our expectation, but went above and beyond. We visited her from Day 1 and stuck to her till the day the baby was born and consulted her even for post pregnancy care.
From Day 1 Dr. Manjula looked after us like we were her family, she acclimated to us very well and made us feel comfortable right from the get go.
We visited her multiple times throughout our pregnancy journey, and each time after the meet we walked away with greater confidence & repose.

We were hellbent on getting a normal delivery and had stated that to the doctor on the very first day as well, the doctor asked us to rest easy and not worry about the delivery now and just to pay attention on the mother and Fetus.
Ultimately the result was a Normal Delivery, led by the very capable hands of Dr. Manjula Deepak :)
The labor for my wife was a long and strenuous one, it lasted for around 16 Hours, there was a scare of going to C Section as well, apart from that there was a condition called ""Caput"" for my Baby (Where the baby's head gets elongated because the baby has been stuck in the vaginal cavity for long). Though all these complication & Obstacles, Dr. Manjula helped us deliver the baby through Normal Vaginal Delivery, a tremendous feat !!!

If i had to describe Dr. Manjula Deepak through a few adjectives, they would be - 
1. Uber Responsible
2. Ferociously Passionate 
3. Fervently Energetic
4. Work ethic of an Ox
5. Acute Knowledge & expertise

To be honest thank you will not satisfy me to appreciate, for what Mam has done and this seems very small word to express gratitude.  

To tell about the background of me & my wife, this is the first pregnancy for us after a very long time yes a very long time. We started searching for a doctor for regular general checks and instead of getting human, we got a goddess that is Dr. Manjula Deepak. 

I do not want to explain all stuff that she does, but she does what is the best for you and do not have a second thought of it, and do not look for a second opinion too as you are at best of hands and thoughts.

My wife delivered a baby girl on 9th of April '2021 with C section, before to that she was tested Covid +ve, even with that mam took it on herself to inform us by calling us so that we do not go bonkers when to see on the report. Mam took and necessary protocols and helped us during these tough times. Kudos to her :).

Mam, you will always be in our prayers and we want you to be the same as you are with the human touch emotions, the friendly nature, the humor which will really help who come to you. I will definitely remember that you use to express us stating that the baby will be like a bodybuilder like me and which she is, these small things help a lot which will be cherished.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"This was my first pregnancy and consulted nearby gynac(which was recommended by our neighbour). Without much research we just went in. Even though having 20 years of experience, she failed to understand that we do have bunch of questions and more excited to know how the pregnency is progressing. But there was no much explanation. During lockdown, I had faced light bleeding and I was super scared and tried to contact doctor. But all in vain. And no response for any of the messages. Finally we decided to change the doctor at my 7th month. That's where we checked in for practo and found Doctor Manjula. Had to write down the older experience, coz you were completely opposite and never let us down. First meet with her, and it was like 'oh god! Why did i not check on her before'. Better late than never. every meet with her, we gained so much knowledge. Being first time pregnant, all my silliest questions was answered. Even if I hesitated to ask any question, she was here to understand and explain in detail of every procedure to be carried out. Simply she could have excluded our husbands in conversations telling its pandemic time. But again she stood above our expectations. Made sure even husband know what's happening and how's the baby growth. Even though I had c section, I was made well aware why C section is being opted. I never regretted for the decision.

I am writing this feedback after 9 months of consultation with the doctor. We visited Dr. Manjula Deepak for pregnancy consultation, we were recommended to visit Dr Manjula mam by one of the Doctor who is also associated to Cloud 9 and visiting new doctor, sharing our past tough times again made us little stressful but after meeting Dr. Manjula Deepak, what do I say? It felt like we met goddess as we asked lot of questions and she was so patiently listening and guiding us in right direction wherever necessary and not confuse you by putting you in situation where you start doing google search and go dig deep into. She answered all the questions generously. We always had a smile on our face when we came out of the cabin. What I liked most about her, when she calls (Ritikaaaaaaaaaaa ‚Äìwith high pitch Ritikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa) that immediately gives us Red Bull energy, get-up-and-go situation to meet her and keep chatting with her whole day and mam will patiently listen to us. Mam responds to messages whenever she is available without disturbing other patients, takes care of emergency seriously and acts on it whenever & wherever required. It was her experience and full confidence on patients, she could assure us that my wife will have a safe normal delivery. It‚Äôs said that Doctors are placed equivalent to God. I would say that it‚Äôs because of Doctors like Manjula Deepak, we had a beautiful pregnancy journey. No words can describe thanks and our experience can‚Äôt be put into words. Today, I seriously have no words to express my feeling but just whole-hearted Million Thanks to you from Ritikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa and Vishal. :) 

Lastly, very important thing to mention, we had a nearby cloudnine center (500mts) but we still choose to go 15 kms far (HRBR center) only because of Dr. Manjula Deepak.

You will always be in safe hands when it comes to Dr. Manjula Deepak.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnant Women Counseling,Maternal Care/ Checkup,Pre and Post Delivery Care,",0,0,YES,"It's a very late review [delivered in Nov'19 :-)] but I really didn't wanted to not post it for such an amazing doctor. 

We came to know about Manjula Deepak along with few other doctors, while we were browsing through good gynos nearby. However, were confused of which doctor to choose, somehow we gave it a go to meet Dr. Manjula Deepak, purely by looking at the reviews on Practo. 
But the day we met her, myself and my husband both were super impressed with her friendliness and the way she explained  everything. No confusion from there, decided to stick to her till the delivery.
Things which impressed us is, when we informed the doc about the travelling plan (when I was in my 6th week) which was planned well before conceiving, she did agree to it but proactively did the scan to check my sack. Also a scan was done by her upon my return too, to see if everything is fine.. And there are many such instances..
Almost at the end of my pregnancy, that's when I was in my 38th week, the scan did show that the baby's weight is little more than the average Indian babies. She immediately took the call to go for delivery in the same week, so as to try best for vaginal birth, since I had no complications and active throughout. 
The day I got admitted to the hospital, it was 10PM and there she was just in 15mins to check me. She was available at 4 in the morning over the call. Again by 7AM in the hospital to check her admitted patients (to be mom's). 
And there again by 9AM for her regular OPD and deliveries. I was awestruck to see the same enthusiasm throughout. 
Finally, we gave up on normal and took a call to go with C-Sec, there was my boy with 3 rounds of cord around his neck. 
If she hadn't adviced on the 38th week and if we were waiting for another 2 weeks for the delivery, have no idea how the situation would've turned out to be. My boy came out safe and all healthy. All thanks to the doctor. 
She is truly an angel, in my mom's words ""Devathe"" :-)

Dr. manjula was our last hope and she definitely made every visit worthy.. she took such good care of my wife during every visit and took time to listen to our problem every time. most of corporate doctors just take 10 mins per patient and try to clear the desk for the next available candidate but this doctor handled our case very sensitively.she made sure that patient was comfortable in talking to her and give all details without hesitation.her style of treating patients was so courteous in nature and we felt so blessed when finally my wife conceived.. it was a big win for us !!  The doctors advice really worked and my wife finally got pregnant.. complete tenure of pregnancy we followed up in same hospital and consulted Dr Manjula she gave us best care and advice for all day to day problems we face and we thank her for this noble service üôèwe are really proud to say that she delivered our first baby which is just next to blessing and was a normal delivery.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Pre and Post Delivery Care,Normal Delivery,",0,0,YES,"With deep gratitude in my heart for Dr. Manjula Deepak, I am writing this review exactly after a month of my delivery. Initially, till my 5 month of pregnancy, I was consulting another Doctor as I was staying in another place. And to be honest, I was in great confusion after we shifted to current location that if its ok to switch Doctor at 5 month, if the Doctor will provide proper care as I am reaching out to her so late in pregnancy.. etc.. etc.. There was so many questions and confusions in mind as it was my first pregnancy. But all these confusions just vanished after the first visit to Dr. Manjula and that turned out to be the amazing decision that we chose her. :) \n\nHope this review helps others who are in search of a Good gynecologist who is in confusion just like I was... So just Jotting down the best points why I would recommend Dr. Majula to others without writing a big essay\n\n1) She is super friendly and makes you really comfortable from the first visit, clears all your queries. Once you visit her, she remembers your name and details. Wherever she sees you, she 'll call out ur name with a big smile.\n2) She doesnot give any unnecessary medicines and tests and foremost She encourages normal delivery unless you have any complications.\n3) Have to tell this.. She is super patient.. Really thankfull to her for this.. I was a person with low pain threshold and also was very scared of normal delivery but so well she used to prepare me for normal delivery and in labour room also she beared all my tantrums and successfully helped me delivering my baby normally and today I am thankfull for that.\n4)I had a severe food infection for which I was moved to another hospital but She was so kind and a person with beautiful heart that she visited me there in the other hospital in midst of this Corona chaos and her busy schedule, which I was least expecting. \n\nThanking God and Dr. Manjula for everything.. :*\nIf anyone is reading my review to see if to visit her then I would just say \""Go Ahead! *** ** *** **** ********",2020-04-25 19:48:43,False,True,JIMILY,Thank you very much jimily for your kind words it means a lot to me,2020-05-06T16:16:34+0000,Dr. Manjula Deepak
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnant Women Counseling,",0,0,YES,"First - why we choose Dr. Manjula: 4 years back when one of my colleague‚Äôs wife was going through rough pregnancy issue and doctors from most of the well established hospitals recommended abortion. But as a last advice he met Dr. Manjula and there where the story begins. I was also accompanying him while we had discussion on what would be the next course of action and the way Dr. Manjula walk us throughout the plan it was on another level. She made us aware of the current situation, complications and then she explained what action plan she was going to perform, it‚Äôs advantages as well as the risk factors associated with the complications. All these were so thoroughly she put across us that it gives confidence on the level of her understanding of the situation. And within 3 months my colleague was blessed with a healthy baby boy. So that‚Äôs where I decided whenever we plan for baby will definitely take experience and expert consultation from Dr. Manjula.
Now on June 2022, we were blessed with a baby boy. We are very thankful to Dr. Manjula Deepak for the guidance and support she given provided throughout the pregnancy journey. She is very friendly and  professional ready to help us with any queries. And the best part is that she responds to our WhatsApp messages as in whenever we have any issue. During pregnancy whenever we had an anxious moment in the last 9 months, We came out content and relaxed after consulting her. Such is her experience and expertise. She always explain all the symptoms before hand each month which will make us relaxed and prepared. During our visit to her she will make us feel good she will always recommend for normal delivery and gives us a diet plan and routine. An Honest and dedicated doctor like her in these days is a blessing to the mankind.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"We decided to visit Dr. Manjula Deepak for our pregnancy after reading the reviews about doctor in practo. From 1st day of visit and till today Dr. Manjula Deepak is very helpful and understanding. she answers all 
queries and clear all the doubts. She is very friendly in nature and makes her patient feel comfortable. Two major complications went smoothly under her medication and guidance. First during 7th month i got chicken 
pox, doctor immediately recommended me to visit Dr. Aruna Prasad (Dermatalogist).And Second during 8th month i got covid and i was given medication and got cured. She is always available for her patients and answer their calls and replies their messages. She does her treatment with minimum medicines and in natural way. She recommends walking and exercise to stay fit during pregnancy and for normal delivery. On my day of delivery early morning my water bag got broke and immediately we messaged doctor and she called us and told to come to hospital. I was operated in labour room by her team (excellent team) as per her instructions and when the exact time came for delivery Dr. Manjula arrived, She made me feel comfortable and started the process. We thank Dr. Manjula Deepak......on 4th march@4.22pm.....we were blessed with our little princess (named- IVANA). It was a beautiful experience and comfortable journey of 9 months with her.

We thank u once again as u gave the opportunity for the father of baby to be present during the delivery and baby was born infront of him.

She is excellent doctor and we recommend people to consult you.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,Pregnant,",0,0,YES,"Dr.Manjula Deepak was like our guardian angel right from our pregnancy test till the delivery of our daughter. She's really really the best doctor you can have on your side as you navigate through your pregnancy. There already 100s of appreciation posts below, but I'd want to highlight a few special things which blew our minds as to-be-parents1) Her focus on aiming for a normal delivery, not believing in unnecessary tests, medicine and array of noisy things you'd read or hear during the journey. She is the brand ambassador of a healthy old-school pregnancy.2) Her ever smiling, never-say-tired attitude which builds your full confidence in her. We've seen first hand how she'd skip lunch, rush to the hospital at 2 AM for your emergency and care for literally each and every mother/family as if they're her own. I've had my share of tryst with doctors and I have never seen someone so dedicated and courteous3) Her patience in listening to your endless queries, coming from in-laws or Google searches - she'll take them in her stride and guide you to the best thing4) She's also the sweetest woman, who'll become like family during this journey & we fell in love with her. There have been times when me and my wife have just wanted to meet her for pep talk :) She's THAT good.I'd recommend her & her hospital staff Cloud9 HRBR blindly to everyone in my circle.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,"Words cannot express the love & gratitude we have in our heart for you Dr. Manual Deepak. One of our cousins referred us to go to Dr. Manjula, as we were planning our delivery in Bangalore. We first visited her when I was 4.5 months pregnant & her first impression was best!!! We were so satisfied with the choice we had made. We have never seen a doctor with such a high energy level & her voice itself is magic. After my first consultation with her, I went back to my native & diligently followed her tips. 
We were looking for a doctor who motivate us for NVD & luckily the feedback we heard about her was meeting our expectations. She patiently listened to me & started tuning my body for normal delivery from the beginning. I had countable consultations with her but the image she had imprinted is immense & irreplaceable. Indeed, she is one of the credible, knowledgeable & talented doctors we have encountered so far & her crowded OPD is the proof of this fact. 
I delivered a healthy baby 15 days ago & big thanks to Dr. Manjula for encouraging me in my labor at midnight 1:30. We salute her commitment towards the profession & the energy she carries irrespective of what time of the day it is. 
There are not enough words to describe how thankful we are for your wonderful care during my pregnancy, labor & delivery. You have helped to bring the perfect miracle into our lives. We took a couple of days to pen down our emotions into words & we believe we had made justification in our attempt. We would highly recommend Dr. Manjula Deepak for any sort of gynecological issues, rest assured you will be in safe hands!!! 
Lastly Thank you for taking such good care of me & my mommy - baby Stuthi Bhat.

As I write this review holding my rainbow baby close to my heart, I can still remember the 1st time I consulted her after being referred by one of the hospital staff during one random visit to cloudnine HRBR layout branch.
I was skeptical about this pregnancy, but she listened to me patiently in our 1st consultation and made me feel relaxed and calmed,which was very difficult for me (having lost my 1st baby some months ago).
During our 2nd meeting, after seeing my nervousness I believe, she promised me that she will give my baby in my hands. I‚Äôm glad she kept her promise.
She was with me throughout this pregnancy, always available for me, be it late night or weekends, whenever I needed her she was there for me.
Even when I used to message her at odd hours, she was quick to call me back ( which I was not expecting from a renowned doctor like her). 
She is an amazing human being apart from being an excellent doctor. Her friendliness and relaxed attitude are a great help for ppl like me.
She never recommends unnecessary medication or tests and always forces to stick to homemade stuffs.
And I love the way she calls my name, which she still does whenever we bump into each other in cloudnine HRBR branch. ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

Doctor was always supportive and counselled me so well n made me stronger. 

Usually during our visits me n my husband used to hv a bunch of questions on diet or excercises or few symptoms related ones, once we entered room doctor used to tell us all of those even before we asked for.

She is super passionate about her work. I thought that whenever I visit her she will go through my papers to review my case but she remembered each and every thing about my case. I used to get nervous and panicked sometimes but visiting her used to calm me down. She understood my nature and the way she used to explain things really helped me to calm my nerves. She will speak to you like a friend or an elder sister. I am going to miss her pat on my cheeks. During my earlier pregnancy days, I consulted some other Gynaecologist . Soon I realised my mistake and in my second month, I consulted Dr Manjula and from that day we were sure that we are going to complete our journey with her. There was no looking back from day. She is energetic with lot of positive vibes. After 18 hours of labour, I was on verge of giving up and asked for cesarean. It was her determination and strong will that I delivered normally. The key is to trust her and follow her advice properly. She will not prescribe unnecessary medication and neither she will call for unnecessary hospital visits or scans ( only whenever it is required). For people like me who was always scared or sceptical about pregnancy and delivering baby she is the perfect Doctor as my journey was completely smooth under her guidance.

"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pre and Post Delivery Care,Pregnancy Exercise,Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"We started consulting Dr Manjula last year when we tried to ascertain if my wife was pregnant. And that was a start to a great journey that lasted till the delivery. 

In today‚Äôs corporate culture and mainstream healthcare cut throat biz world, It‚Äôs rare to find a doctor that is empathetic, knowledgeable, experienced, a great subject matter expert, and most importantly available. Dr Manjula showed a resounding overlap of all such qualities. 

From the first moment you meet her, you get engulfed in her positivity and highly addictive energy. She was sharp to assess problems, and then break them down into pointers that helped her patients understand the issue better. What followed were simplistic yet effective resolutions that helped my wife throughout her pregnancy. What was remarkable was her process to calm her patients nerves - not just with faff but logic, science and expertise. 9/10 times we walked out of her consultation with a big smile on our face -  that one time was probably because of long wait hours at the hospital (kidding).

What sets her apart is not only her dedication, passion and sincerity towards her profession but also her positive outlook & comforting approach. 

She can solve the most complex medical issues with ease and reassure the expecting parents that everything is under control. I have seen many patients wait in queues to be consulted by Dr Manjula as she is renowned for addressing the most complicated pregnancies successfully. 

I could cruise through my pregnancy because of Dr Manjula's guidance at every step. She handled my case with utmost ease and made me feel confident about myself and my own body!

Another notable fact is her holistic approach towards Pregnancy.  She advocates natural remedies, does not prescribed unwarranted medications, emphasizes the importance of being physically active and provides practical dietary guidance as well. She is one of the few doctors who tracks weight gain diligently through out the pregnancy to ensure it is under control. She ensures she sets you on the path towards a smooth, normal delivery. 

Inspite of having one of the busiest schedules, she ENSURES and provides detailed guidance and is always available for any queries and emergencies. 

I highly recommend Dr Manjula and feel privileged to have been under her care for my pregnancy & delivery.

We had no idea who is the best doctor in this hospital. We came to know about Dr. Manjula Deepak through one of my colleagues and also through few patients at Cloudnine HRBR. 

Big Thanks to Dr. Manjula Deepak who is selfless and works like a super woman. I got tired by looking at her commitment and dedication. Personally I got inspired by looking at her work nature and involvement. She is an inspiration and we see less such awesome people around us.

I can go on and write endlessly about Dr. Manjula Deepak. Just one word about her ""Eyes closed just go to her, you will be happier that you have chosen the right person for welcoming your new bundle of joy to your family"".

We had few problems in our pregnancy related to placenta. Dr explained about this clearly and comforted us. 

Though we have tried for normal delivery, due to dilation issues couldn't go for normal. Dr tried for normal as much as possible, but after 10 hours of efforts since my Wife's dilation was not enough, we decided to go for C section. She is did a great job in the surgery. My wife could be on her own within few days since surgery.

Dr Manjula is a go to person, feels like a friend, energetic person, runs around labor room to OT to consultations non stop even in this corona pandemic situation caring less of her. People like Manjula is a reason for any new parents such as us to have the pleasant pregnancy process through out 9 months as we know that there is our doctor who is looking out for us for any concerns or doubts.

Final word-- choose Dr. Manjula Deepak eyes closed.'

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnant,",0,0,YES,"Our life was completely changed when we got to know that I was pregnant. This was my first pregnancy after a long wait, also want to mention here that I come in elderly primi. So, I and my husband were concerned about which doctor to go to.. We were getting loads of advices from our dear ones and we too were praying to God to lead us to the best doc in the town and that is how we met Dr. Manjula from Cloud9. Our first meeting with her was so beautiful as both of us felt that peace in our hearts and we knew that she is the one who would bring our baby out into the world.. I had met her in the 12th week of my pregnancy and I am thankful to the Lord Jesus for making us meet with her. My every visit was so soothing and positive. As it was my first pregnancy, we had loads of questions and concerns which Dr. Manjula patiently listened to and answered.. She was even quick to reply to all my WhatsApp msgs.. She would talk like a mother, a sister and would always encourage and assure me that my pregnancy was perfect and that always made me  thrilled. My pregnancy journey would not have been this joyful without her guidance and support. I'm usually scared when it comes to hospitals, but I got so comfortable with my beloved doctor from day one. The way she deals with her patients is simply amazing. One very important thing I would want to mention here is Dr. Manjula prefer normal delivery. She wouldn't simply take the mother for cesarean until and unless it's really needed. If God blesses me with another child then Dr. Manjula would be my 'go to person' for sure..

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I have consulted with Dr Manjula Deepak for a period of almost a year. Started with pre-pregnancy consultation and the doctor saw me through all the way till I delivered my twins last month.

Dr Manjula is one of the most friendly and reassuring doctors that I have consulted with. Her cheery attitude and confidence are very comforting. With a twin pregnancy, I started off being very scared - both about how my body would handle it and for the wellbeing of the babies. The doctor was extremely reassuring at all times. She never prescribed excessive medicines. In fact, she discouraged me from getting unnecessary scans / tests and stuck to fairly simple ground rules for the entire pregnancy. Unlike in a number of other twin pregnancy stories I have heard, she permitted me to travel in my second trimester and encouraged me to remain active through most of my pregnancy. She always set realistic expectations. What could otherwise have been a challenging time was made much easier because of her approach. 

The doctor spent a considerable amount of time during each consultation explaining matters well and going over scans with us carefully. She usually preempted most questions we had and was always available on phone for any follow up doubts / problems I had. On two occasions, she rushed to the hospital because I was facing discomfort - on the second occasion, she delivered my beautiful twins :) 

Even with the decision of whether to go for a natural delivery of a c-section, and during the actual surgery, the doctor was very informative and caring. This went a long way in making me feel comfortable and in control. One instance is that right before I was taken for the surgery, she remembered that I was very scared of injections and asked the anesthetist to personally insert the tube for the IV so that I would be caused minimal pain and discomfort.  It made me feel like I was in very good hands - which I certainly was!

I am extremely grateful to the doctor for her support. Most of all, since I have a tendency to stress a lot, it really helped that she balanced it off with her reassuring and kind approach. I recommend the doctor highly. ",2021-04-21 15:52:48,False,True,Bhavya Mohan,Thank you very much bhavya for your kind words it means a lot to me,2021-05-13T11:45:08+0000,Dr. Manjula Deepak

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,Pregnant,Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"We visited Dr. Manjula Deepak during my wife's pregnancy and I must admit that she was no less than a blessing in our lives. In January 2020, my wife was pregnant and we were overwhelmed with the news, we were all happy until she was 12 weeks after a few blood tests (double marker) the doctors from other hospitals informed us that the test shows high risk (Its high level is indicative to a higher risk of Trisomy 18 and Down's syndrome) unfortunately all this was happening during the pandemic and the lockdown. I and my wife visited more than 3 to 4 hospitals and every time it was disappointing. few doctors also advised us to abort and to not take any chances that is when we were introduced to DR Manjula Deepak through my wife's friend. The first day we met her we realized we were in right place and the safe hands. Oh my god, what a personality i have never seen a doctor like her in my life and I am not exaggerating the passion she has towards her profession, the way she communicates with her patients, the confidence she gives to the family members of the patients. she is available round the clock and you can ask her any doubts any time she answers it without losing her cool. She took us through the entire pregnancy with such ease. then came the labor time my wife was admitted to the hospital at 10 pm she was home at that time I was surprised to see her in the hospital at 11 pm and she was just around and finally after almost 10 hours I was all tired but again to my surprise she made sure by 9.33 am my wife had a normal delivery and we welcomed a baby girl. I can go on and on about this wonderful human being but I have kept things short. I am recommending Dr. Munjala Deepak to others with 100% confidence and am sure she is going to be a blessing in your lives that we can guarantee from our own experience. here I am thanking her once again for changing our lives.Thanking you and will always be grateful   Sandeep Ramachandran    Gayathri Priyanka",2020-09-09 16:20:25,False,True,Sandeep,Thank you very much sandeep and Gayathri for your kind words it means a lot to me,2020-09-12T03:26:41+0000,Dr. Manjula Deepak

She is highly energetic , humble, friendly & equally professional. She always made me feel comfortable. She is highly positive person which always kept me away from worries. In my 35th week of consultation we got to know that baby has not taken the position as it has more than the expected weight. Myself & my husband thot it‚Äôs gonna be a caesarean for sure .. Manjula DeEpAk did not give up she gave us time for the next 2 weeks & even at the time of delivery wen I personally gave up on normal delivery bcoz of pain I had to go thru. But Dr Manjula just walked up to the Labour room that night and comforted and gave assurance for a normal delivery irrespective of the situation which made us to re-think on our decision and agreed for Normal delivery. She proved that she was right which made us so happy. My sincere gratitude to MaNjUlA Deepak from bottom of my heart for her sincere support & proper guidance throughout my pregnancy journey. It was an amazing decision I made consulting & trusting MaNjUlA Deepak with no other 2nd thought anytime in this journey.

My wife and I started visiting Dr.Manjula since the beginning of our pregnancy. She is a representative of kindness, friendliness, compassion, love and care and goes all her way out to put her patients at ease. 
She is someone who is available at anytime, on call, whatsapp and personally to counsel her patients. In our case, my wife had a bleeding in the early weeks of her pregnancy, and Dr.Manjula ensured we were tension free and safeguarded the health of both my wife and our baby. At every point, she would give us information before hand about what to expect, which made us well prepared for the situation. In our case, my wife had a water break at home, and we were totally panicking. Just a call to Dr.Manjula, and she ensured things happened smoothly. She had already instructed the labour section about our coming, and once we were there, she ensured she arrived in no time(though her presence at that moment was actually not needed), just to comfort us. Also, from the day 1, she prepared my wife for a normal delivery by guiding her with basic exercises and diet, and the result was a normal vaginal delivery. It was late night when my wife was suffering with labour pain, and I was in total pain too seeing her suffer. I requested Dr.Manjula to go for C-section, so that it would ease my wife's pain. However, even in such a situation, she calmed me down, counseled me and brought out our beautiful angel into this world.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy Check Up,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Exercise,Bleeding During Pregnancy,Pregnancy with PCOD,",0,0,YES,"Dr.Manjula came into our lives as a God sent gift. She is a representative of humanity, approachability, friendliness and kindness in treating her patients. My personal experience about doctors made me very apprehensive about the entire fraternity, but she proved otherwise. She knows what each of her patients wants and approaches each of them with a personal touch.

My wife was pregnant with PCOD and she ensured to instill confidence in us and pushed us for a normal delivery. In the first few weeks of pregnancy, my wife started bleeding but she was very calm and ensured that the child was safe and healthy. We had to go through a lot of emotional tension due to the covid situation, but she was always there at any time, be it on call, WhatsApp or personally to counsel and guide us. She answers even the silliest of questions with so much patience, and understands the patient from a motherly perspective. 
Our labour was unexpected since my wife's water broke at home. She immediately responded by coming to the hospital on that day, though it was a holiday, and the procedure could've been initiated by the duty doctor. At my request, she came in and instilled confidence in us. I was unable to see my wife undergo so much pain and called her requesting for a C-section. She calmed me down in this situation and ran in to the delivery room at the odd hour and made the normal vaginal delivery possible. 
Also, a special mention needs to be made about her post pregnancy care. She will be there for you even after delivery and guide you like an elder sister. ln my opinion, Dr.Manjula is an asset not just for Cloud nine hospital but to the entire medical fraternity. God bless her and her family always. She's truly a gem and words fall short to express our gratitude to her. We are lucky to know her and be associated with her.

"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"I had researched Dr Manjula online as being a doctor who focuses on diet, exercise and natural remedies during pregnancy and she was nearby, which is why we chose to go to her from the first trimester itself! And she certainly lived up to that, giving natural solutions where possible and avoiding medication unnecessarily while helping me stay active during pregnancy!

It was controversial in my family when we chose to go to her instead of the usual doctor family members go to in Manipal, but I'm so glad we did, as our experience was way better than some of the stories we'd heard of about other doctors. Later, I heard that people come from far to visit her and now I understand why and having gone through my entire pregnancy, delivery and recovery with her, with such good experience, I probably will travel any distance for her to be my OB as well :)

Dr Manjula is a ball of energy! In the initial consultations, I found her too fast, though she never rushed us. Even if we forgot to ask her anything, she was always prompt, although not very verbose in answering on whatsapp, giving clear answer to what needs to be done. It's not just her high energy and positivity which made an impression, it was great to hear that she was in CMC Vellore and also to hear positive reviews from other doctors about her! 

My labour was really long and hard and during delivery, we saw that she was certainly very skilled and knowledgeable in various induction and delivery options, aims for least intervention possible, gives you the time needed, explains options and allows you to decide, doesn't rush there either and is adept at performing different procedures too! 

As I write this, it has been one and a half months since we delivered our baby and it was a very smooth journey from the frist trimester to delivery, to recovery now and only because of Dr Manjula's expert guidance and execution! Thanks doc!

She came highly recommended by people living around in North Bangalore . 
During my first trimester - i was nauseous all the time , puking multiple times in a day and dead tired . To add to that I had a bad bout of fever but Dr Manjula was always quick to respond on whatsapp with remedies . The only thing I looked forward to in my first trimester was waiting outside her consultation room to be called in  . If you ask any of her past or current patients they will tell you how she has a distinct warm way of calling out your name. She is such a positive force that for the duration of the consultation you would forget any pain and discomfort. 
I have always been super active , so my biggest concern was that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do so during my pregnancy . All my worries disappeared when I met her - she ensured that I had a normal and healthy pregnancy (dispelling a lot of myths regarding food and exercises ) . I was able to continue running after my first trimester right up until the day I delivered . I wholeheartedly thank Dr Manjula for instilling that confidence in me to continue . 

Lastly my family was always quite keen on ensuring that I have a normal vaginal delivery . Dr Manjula recommended exercises throughout my pregnancy and kept monitoring the scans in the last few weeks to ensure that we push for a vaginal delivery as much as possible . So you can imagine how elated we were when I delivered a baby boy vaginally after a labour of just 5 hours .

Dr mam kept us in ease and mam was very friendly with us. Mam used to answer even our simplest and silly questions with a smile .
Mam was available even in the odd hours like morning  4 am and night 11 pm and so on . I contacted mam when I had an emergency during my labour .
I had severe back ache and my water broke in 36 weeks. I was in emergency and called mam in odd hours . Mam was always available for our questions and support.
My labour was also very pleasant experience because of Dr Manjula mam. She kept me very comfortable during my delivery.  I delivered a baby boy Via C-section on June 13th, 2020. Her soothing voice gave me confidence during my delivery .  I have completely recovered and got discharged in 3 days from hospital and now I am spending happy time with my bundle of joy at my home .

Its very hard that you can find a human in this decade who can understand your pain, difficulties and never lets you down. Here comes Manjula mam, who is a paragon of empathy and positive energy. There is a saying that God sometimes lives in the form humans and she is one perfect example for it. I am surely not praising her high, its all the good attributes which requires a strong applause and you will notice all this if you ever got to visit her.

Let me just narrate how she bestowed happiness in to our family. I took my sister to Manjula mam after looking at all positive reviews on Practo( I did not miss even a single review) and did not mind travelling for one hour to meet such efficient doctor. My sister was in complete depression due to her previous pregnancy, where she lost her twins due to preterm delivery in 24 weeks due to complete negligence by previous doctors( Its not easy even for the family members as it took away my complete family happiness). During the first meet itself doctor was able to completely understand the mental status that my sister would be in and gave complete confidence to my sister just like a family member would do. Even the silliest questions where answered without any denial and this made my sister believe that she will be there at any time to help. From the time she conceived and till delivery her emotions were running high and it was Manjula mam who was able to calmly answer all her questions and give her the much required confidence. I don't think anyone else could even do this with much patience. Now my sister got blessed with a Baby boy and it was completely because this time it was God send angel Manjula mam who took care of my sister. I still remember her words "" This is my responsibility to give your baby healthy in your hand and will not let a single seed unturned"" and she did it.

     When I was 2 months pregnant I had bleeding problem and visited X hospital with one of the doctor instead of consoling or treating she was scolding treated me so badly in my first visit itself I was thinking OMG till 9 months should I visit this doctor.Done with scan and blood test with much difficulty and duty doctor told me that I have gestational diabetes and suggested to come in morning and doctor will start insulin.I was shocked and confused and without second thought she want to start insulin, then me and my husband decided to take an another opinion
  
     we started searching for an another doctor and one of my friend suggested Dr Manjula Deepak mam.... In my first visit manjula madam spoke so nicely and gave so much confidence that no need of insulin and can be controlled through proper diet. I was having both hypertension and gestational diabetes. During my first visit with Mam I felt so good and felt am in safe hands.Mam explained my health condition very clearly made me feel relaxed and gave confident. In every visit mam took care of me so nicely... After 8th month my BP started fluctuating day by day but doctor has given an indication about this in prior to me and my husband and to follow just the instructions given. After 35week every week Mam told to visit frequently and in 36week my bp was getting high n fluid was very low. Next day early morning I got slight pain and messaged mam... Mam asked me to come immediately to hospital and when we reached hospital mam also came immediately and pains started getting more and within two hour delivered my Lil princess. In spite of my health conditions and complications during my pregnancy Manjula Mam made it so easy and I had normal delivery.   Its a big story but worth writing it just because of Manjula Deepak mam

Those who are searching for good gynaecologist without single thought please consult Dr. Manjula deepak - Cloud Nine Hospital.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy with PCOD,",0,0,YES,"Definitely I will have to share my journey with Dr Manjula Deepak. I would say she's my Angel, when I was in a mindset that I'm not going to have baby due to PCOD issues but then she turned out everything to a positive do... I've been treated for PCOD from 2 long years and I couldn't concieve because of that .I tried changing different gynaecologists to get this problem treated but nothing worked out when ever I meet the new gyni the first thing they would say is try for anv IVF getting pregnant is not possible with medication for PCOD this made me get so depressed and frustrated and that is the time when I met dr manjula her only magic is think positive and her positive Vibes makes us think everything positive... And the most wonderful thing is she just put me on 3 months course and the medicine she prescribed me was more of multivitamins and healthy tablets which doesn't even cause any side effects. And yes on the third month of course it was a boom I was pregnant... Dr Manjula made it happen she's such a beautiful person who's always sweet and polite with her patients with a complete package of positiveness and anytime we can reach her for doubts she tries to respond even during a busy schedule... And one of the major thing about her is she always prefers for normal vaginal delivery I was conceived with placenta previa where in normal delivery was not an easy task for my complications and offcourse yes I had a normal delivery... But since the day I concievied the only thing she use to say is your going to have a normal vaginal delivery despite any complications... That was such a positive boost for me and this is to all the women's who's trying to conceive from a very long time due to Hormonal and infertility issues please do visit Dr Manjula atleast once and I swear that's gonna change your life she's an Angel to all the women's out ther...

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"It was a very happy moment to know my wife was pregnant. As usual, I was doing online survey to find a **** doctor (gynecologist). I found Dr. Manjula mam on Practo. After reading some of the reviews, I thought they must be paid ones. But looking at the number of reviews, I was convinced that they are not. So, we decided to go ahead with Manjula mam, even though cashless insurance facility (for the medical insurance I had) was not available in that hospital.Before consulting Dr. Manjula for the first time, I had lots of questions in mind, which I listed down, so that I could ask her. We met the doctor and realized that all the review comments about her are really true. We felt as if we are talking to one of our friends, rather than doctor. She is such a friendly and nice person, having lots of patience to explain us each and everything. Her explanation covered all my questions and I didn't have to ask them. So we decided to stay with the same doctor and not to switch to anyone else.Meanwhile my wife had some problem in the early third month, which was putting her pregnancy under risk. Dr. Manjula mam monitored my wife's condition closely and solved the problem. She even shared her personal mobile number to contact her directly under any emergency. *** ****** ******* *********** *********** ****** ******** ** ** **** **** **** ******* *** ********* She was preparing my wife for normal delivery.Later my baby had some complications, which forced doctor to deliver the baby at 32 weeks.

Baby is still in intensive care unit, but he is also doing very good.

She is a bundle of energy and she manages her team so well that under her guidance, all takes care of the patient like a family member. At the time of my labour which was early morning , we informed Ma'am over phone , and she might had just got up but guess what , once we reached hospital within few minutes of time she was there with me ,which gave me a confidence that I am in a safe hand.

we went to Cloudnine HRBR without doing any research about which doctor to consult(This is how we usually do :) ). Hospital provided Manjula mam's appointment(we now feel really lucky for that). On our first meeting itself, she made us absolutely  relaxed with her friendliness and the way she explained things. She talked to us with such a positivity that we felt pregnancy can be made less stressful. When we left the hospital after the first visit, we decided to continue with Manjula mam for the rest of the pregnancy. I have seen my friends going to different doctors for second opinion and third opinion , we never had to do that at any point of time.

These are some of the things which really helped us-

1) she explain things very clearly. Most of our question which we prepared got answered before we ask.
2)Answers were very specific. if we ask whether we can do something, she  either say 'yes' or 'no'. This was most helpful as we have seen doctors confuse people by leaving a choice to the patient by saying pros and cons of our action. Here she had taken decisions for us and we just need to follow whatever she say.
3)Although she is very busy, she gave ample time for everyone and made sure we leave her room with clear state of mind.

Her importance was completely realized on the day of delivery. There was a duty doctor who made me totally panic saying there is some complication. Later I met Manjula mam and she said nothing to worry and delivered the baby in 15 minutes. I thanked God for sending us to the right doctor and I believe God deliver his wishes through doctor's hands.

From the first appointment, I knew she‚Äôs the one I will be consulting for my next pregnancy. After so much of trauma and depression, Dr.Manjula has boosted my confidence drastically and Put a smile on my face with her words and assurance about a successful pregnancy. Her positive energy and friendliness towards her patients makes the environment light and relieving. Throughout my pregnancy journey, she kept me informed about each and every detail as to why she is prescribing the medicine,why she‚Äôs asking to avoid a particular food etc.. also she would interact with my husband and mom to make them feel comfortable and answer their doubts too.

Her ability to speak English, Hindi , Telugu,Kannada And Tamil makes you feel comfortable to speak with her in your choice of language. when it‚Äôs difficult to find a good doctor who genuinely cares for her patients these days in Bangalore, i have spread the word about Dr.Manjula to as many women as possible to visit her for their pregnancy and other fertility related issues as i want them to benefit from this doctor . I would really miss meeting her and may many people get benefitted with her service in and around HRBR layout.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Well, I conceived last year in the month of April and got it tested through Dr Manjula in hospital. Me and my husband were so happy to know about the news. As the days passed, I got certain complications like spotting (and lumps) in initial days of pregnancy which lasted for almost 10-15 days and Dr Manjula asked me to take a tablet to stop spotting and sustain the pregnancy. I was also asked for a bedrest for 1-2 weeks after which spotting subsided. My dr. was always positive on me and never lost any hope. She always asked me NOT to Google anything and to always stay calm and happy. She believed in miracles and nature and so did I. I just followed her instructions and had supreme faith in my God. But my spotting was on and off till 3 months and I was always tensed on that. That‚Äôs not the end! Other complications like cystic swelling in umbilical chord, cyst in placenta, low lying placenta and a single umbilical artery were also diagnosed in 1st trimester scans..Due to these, I was asked to go through NIPT scan instead of double marker Test to check for the chromosomes related disorder. By grace of god, the reports were normal and also by the 2nd trimester the cysts were not visible. Even the placenta position was high. Spotting was totally stopped and then my pregnancy went smoothly apart from some normal ups and downs like urine infection in 2nd trimester, abdominal pain due to gas some days and other normal symptoms. Every now and then I used to reach hospital to get the scan done and Dr Manjula was like ‚ÄòI am a gone case‚Äô by nowüòä My husband and I used to get tensed so much that we just used to rush hospital without giving a second thought. And Mam was always available on WhatsApp and in hospital no matter what. She always responded to me immediately even in her super busy routine. She is really supportive and friendly and boosts your positivity and motivation level. I always got positive vibes from her. Moreover, she is always with full energy and so active that seeing her will really make you feel happy! Till the end, she had full faith on me that I will be able to deliver normally and I did it in her presence! A great doctor and above all, a great human being and so much down to earth. Having so many degrees and so much experience of handling many cases of complicated deliveries, she has no proud and is very sophisticated and patient. Would highly recommend her. Wishing to have my next pregnancy (if at all we plan) with her as well! God willing!

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnant,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Manjula Deepak, The Angel 

Ours is a story of ups, downs, losses, endless tears, sleepless nights,  dreams,  hopes and finally a happy beginning!

I got pregnant for the first time after 3 years of marriage in 2020, which unfortunately turned out to be an ectopic pregnancy and I had to undergo an emergency salpinogectomy at Cloudnine HRBR to remove my right fallopian tube . As much as we were Thankful to God for saving us at the right time and preventing a fatality,  things went down South for us since then..... We faced a plethora of issues -   Low AMH, uncertainity of the left fallopian tube favouring a pregnancy,  doctors giving up on us and pushing us into IVF, which we even attempted and failed at, doctor giving up on me saying that ""You Would Never Be Able to Conceive Naturally"" , ""Another IVF is the only option"".  
We didn't have the energy to attempt another IVF and moved on and decided to give the hospital visits a break. During one of the hospital lab visits at Cloudnine HRBR, a senior nurse heard my story and recommended DR.Manjula Deepak. She said that i could just meet her once and I wouldn't even have to pay for the consultation, which amused me. I went ahead and met Manjuala ma'am, who was a person beaming with positive energy, she pushed me to believe that i will get pregnant and have my baby in my arms within a year.  A couple of months later, we saw a ray of hope when I conceived naturally. It was unbelievable to see something tiny grow inside me in the 4th week scan, which Manjula ma'am revealed. Unfortunately,  that ended up in a blighted Ovum and I was heartbroken. I remember breaking down terribly in Manjula ma'am's cabin. She stood by us and still didn't give up on me and asked me to meet Dr.Manju Nair, her very good friend at Cloudnine Fertility to help me further.

I consulted Dr.Manju Nair, a very positive & energetic doctor, for a month and she helped me with the accurate timing and provided me the right kind of medicines. In a month,  I conceived naturally again.  My heart was racing when Dr.Manjula Deepak performed my first scan at 4th week.  This time it looked better than the previous time and we had our fingers crossed for the next scan.  We prayed all Gods to bless us this time at least. Majula ma'am was very confident,  but I wasn't able to pull myself up considering my previous bitter experience.  

Finally the day of my first important scan arrived. My heart was racing like a train and I was just hoping that the radiologist could find a tiny heart beat inside me. I had mixed feelings as I lay in the scan room... when I suddenly heard the radiologist say ""Can you hear that? That's your baby's heart beat"".  Happiness is not just the right word to describe what I felt at that moment. 

 Manjula ma'am's belief and God's blessings finally turned things positive for us.  We can't thank Manjula ma'am enough for the support she extended throughout the 9 months even with my GDM issue,  filing us with her contagious positive energy and pushing us through every step till the final decisive day.... We had walked in for my final consultation to discuss my birth plan when Manjula ma'am's instinct told her to perform a C- section on the very same day.  We weren't prepared mentally,  I didn't even have my hospital bag ready! and I was ready for my C-section in 5 hours. We blindly trusted Manjula Madam cos we knew that she couldn't go wrong.  We were glad that we didn't push ourselves for induced labour, considering my previous history.  On April 21st 2022, at 5.06PM , I heard my little one cry in that OT and felt her soft skin on my cheek.... tears came rolling down..it was a dream come true.. 
Manjula ma'am's instinct saved us even at that moment since my baby had a loop of cord around her neck and any delay could have put us through situations we couldn't have imagined. 

Dr. Manjula Deepak - An angel with Positive energy, zeal,  never give up attitude and belief in God. She is the reason why we never gave up.  She is the reason why I am a mother today.  As I celebrate my first mother's day,  I would like to thank Dr.Manjula Deepak from the bottom of my heart for not giving up on me and keeping up her promise of bringing my little one into the world within a year of facing a frantic downhill path. 

The world needs such doctors! We love you Manjula ma'am ‚ù§Ô∏è

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Please note that we are sharing our experience with an hope that it may help someone who would be searching for good gynecologist and with a wish that even everyone should get the same experience what we have got... Whatever I'm sharing here is purely based on our own experience, this is not to influence/impress anyone nor by someone's compulsion.I'm not sure from where to start but even till today we just can't believe ourselves that we have met a doctor who will make you feel as you are one of their dearest friend...Yes that's true... We just choosed Manjula Deepak by reading the reviews updated on Practo (We should thank the people who have updated their honest experience on Practo). We got wondered by the number of reviews updated and the ratings provided by everyone on Practo, me and my husband started thinking is this doctor really good as described by everyone here. We were regular to Malleshwaram Cloudnine branch and after we shifted to TC Palya Main road it became difficult (travelling from TC Palya to Malleshwaram everytime) to visit the gynecologist (don't want to mention the name) whom we were visiting regularly so we started searching for good gynecologist around our location, as usual we started searching through online, In between in the month of Jun-19 I had some concerns on my health and by considering the number of years of experience provided on practo doctor's profile we choosed one of the senior gynecologist with 30  years experience (again don't want to mention their name) and visited Cloudnine HRBR and it was just normal consultation and was really not happy with that consultation so again started searching for gynecologist and luckily I found Manjula Deepak's profile on Practo and found that she is available in Cloudnine HRBR branch so consulted her for first time for the same problem, as that was a very ignorable concern she also suggested the same advice as previous senior gynecologist suggested, but in my first consultation only I'm pretty much impressed by her nature, the confidence and the feeling I got on her after coming out from the consultation room was completely different. Almost for a week I discussed about Manjula Deepak with my husband by describing him about her nature, the way she spoke to me with regard to my health concern, her dressing sense, after listening to all this even my husband told me that the way you are describing her gives me a feeling that she is a doctor with different qualities so let's continue with her. Yes I should completely agree on it and sure she has blessed with unique personalities to be a doctor.The reason I was checking for gynecologist in May-19 month was to plan for our second baby and before that I wanted to get clarified on few concerns I was having on my health. Later in Oct-19 I became pregnant and off course how can I think of anyone else when Manjula ma'am is around us. Our journey went so smoothly not even a single day I had different thought in my mind, we were so relaxed and our confidence level was keep boosting post every consultation by the way she was explaining, by the way she was making us understand each and everything in detail was really phenomenal. We blessed with baby girl on 10th Jun 2020 and seriously I just can't describe how everything went smoothly and without facing any hurdle our little one entered the world.A big thanks to Doctor Manjula Deepak for making us to feel proud parents of our little one...

She was ever ready to help, assist and soothe us throughout our journey and made it fun-filled, safe and joyous.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Miscarriage,Normal Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Initially I was consulting a different doctor from another hospital. After miscarriage the way that doctor reacted was very unpleasant. So we visited Dr.Manjula Deepak at Cloud9 HRBR for second opinion. Manjula ma'am explained everything in detail even before we asked her and clarified all queries that I had in mind. It was her way of handling the situation and explaining the facts made us feel better. We immediately decided to continue with Manjula ma'am. She gave us confidence to try again. 
She is friendly with everyone and has a positive vibe, which helps us to remain calm and gain more confidence.
I had lot of other health issues throughout the pregnancy and Manjula ma'am was very caring and always reachable on whatsapp.
Even when labour started 3 weeks earlier than due date, i did not panic because of the way Manjula ma'am spoke to me. Baby heart rate started slowing down during labour but still Manjula ma'am tried her best to continue with normal delivery. Finally baby was born in normal delivery and both mother and baby are safe. All credits to Manjula ma'am. 
We sincerely thank Dr.Manjula Deepak from bottom of our hearts for all the care from day one. She is the best. ",2023-07-26 12:11:04,False,True,Jayanthi,,,

We cannot find the right words to express our appreciation for having made our dream come true. Such a gift! The path was not easy, but the professionalism, empathy and attention to us characterise you Doctor. 
We have started consulting Doctor Manjula Deepak since 2018 since then there were several hurdles which hampered our dream of being a parent. Doctor was always supportive and made any issue look simple she always poured positive thoughts and support during anguish due to which we persisted and now our dream has come true, blessed with twins. 
We would be always grateful to Dr Manjula Deepak for the extensive support and care she provided us all over these years. Our experience with Doctor is extraordinary as she deals a complicated procedure like a walk in the park. We will vouch for Doctors skills, friendliness and care etc.,
You have no idea how much of a blessing you are to us. Thanks for being such an amazing doc.

The first time we went, we had to hear a news that would have driven us very sad but the way she explained and assured that everything would be alright at the end, gave us hopes. We just followed what Mam asked us to and indeed all went well. The positive vibes she spreads inspired us and you will feel inspired even by talking to her. She is such a joy hopping around in hospital premises. Even during regular scans during pregnancy, though there were minor issues called out in scan reports, she assured us nothing to worry. During labour too, we felt very confident when we knew Mam was around. She assured we would try to go with normal delivery 95% and finally we delivered normal delivery - the great part of it, we would attribute to Mam.

She shows empathy, which for me many doctors failed at. She put me at ease, answered my questions (believe me, I had many and at every appointment) and in tough times, she gave me a hope and a prayer. She let me know the procedures before hand and explained it in detail, be it as minute as a need for an injection. Personally, she prefers her patients to undergo a vaginal delivery if possible but when it was decided as a c-section for me, she supported me and made sure I did not fall into a guilt trip! ( Well, cos I was mentally preparing for a vaginal delivery for 9 months!). I'll never forget her saying that she doesn't want me to have a traumatic birthing experience (no one ever told me that birthing could be an experience otherwise). And so it was, not a pain free but a trauma free experience! Amidst her daily count of dozens of patients, she remembered a tiniest detail about my condition and ensured to tell the on duty doctor prior to my surgery and made sure that I do not undergo any stress cos of that. You would see her enter the hospital with an aura that will just awe you. I have seen her at the hospital at odd hours attending to patients, spending overnight after a procedure and finally meeting lots of other patients the next day with the same zest.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Normal Delivery,",0,0,YES,"I  have started consulting Dr. Manjula in the 3rd trimester.  Dr. Manjula has treated me very well.

On the first day of consultation, Dr. Manjula has enquired about all the previous checkups, scans, medication, exercise, and diet I have followed. Since the first delivery was normal, after examining me and the fetal position, she gave us the confidence that the second delivery will also be a normal one. She has advised me to do specific exercises and to follow the prescribed diet.

I and my husband are very much happy about the way Dr.Manjula has interacted with us. She is very friendly, confident, and explains the procedures very well. She made us feel confident and prepared us to take our minds off all the worries.

We rushed to the hospital due to labor pain and water breakdown at 12:30 am midnight and only the duty doctor was there at that time. But, by 3 am when I was in the labor room Dr. Manjula had reached there to take care of my delivery. I was very happy and relieved with the presence of Dr. Manjula there at the time of delivery. Dr. Manjula supported me throughout the process of NVD.

Dr. Manjula is an amazing and extraordinary doctor. Above all she is a dynamic, friendly, and energetic human being.  Me and my family would like to thank her from the bottom of our hearts for all her support.

In light of the Covid situation, the management implemented strict rules restricting people from entering the building in order to ensure everyone's safety, which I applaud.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnant,",0,0,YES,"Ive been through my pregnancy and childbirth journey with Dr Manjula Deepak in entirety. I picked her from the myriad of Ob-gyns available in Bangalore solely on the basis of practo reviews and it has done justice. 
Dr Manjula really does keep the best interest of the patient in mind while recommending a solution or a course of treatment. 
Her demeanour is always positive and she does to a large extent respects the wishes of her patients. 
One of the most outstanding points that I appreciate her for is the fact that she believes in the concept of a healthy pregnancy by insisting on the practise of self control when it comes to food so weight gain stays in the healthy range and at the same time suggesting  appropriate exercises to aid that goal. This helped me have the pregnancy and delivery I had aimed for. 
The only downside to my experience was that the waiting time to see the doctor was too much every time, this was especially hard during covid peak months where one would not want to remove masks to eat and drink freely.

She was 100% sure that she could do a Normal delivery. She explained me and my husband and requested to trust her and give her a chance. even though i was not happy at that moment, when I turn back and see , we are extremely grateful for her decision.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy,",0,0,YES,"Firstly, a big thank you to Dr. Manjula. She gets it! My husband and I were referred to Dr. Manjula by our family friend. Despite trying and consulting a number of doctors, we were not able to conceive for over 5 years of marriage, and this was taking a toll on us. Meeting Dr. Manjula gave us the confidence and courage to not give up. She gave us the clarity we needed without alarming us or giving us false hope. Dr. Manjula was not only honest and respectful with the diagnosis, but also made our journey enjoyable rather than an ordeal. We could reach out to her at any time during the day as she was just one message away. With Dr. Manjula‚Äôs guidance, I was able to conceive on the second visit and deliver a healthy baby girl on November 2021. She gave me the courage and pushed me to have a vaginal childbirth. Moreover, Dr. Manjula gave me guidance on diet and exercise in addition to the necessary medical advice I needed. She was attentive to my concerns and reasoned them out, making it a stress-free pregnancy for me.¬†
Visits to the hospital were something that my husband and I were always eager about, all thanks to Dr. Manjula‚Äôs infectious energy! Her energetic personality, along with her skills, made this journey a memorable one. I‚Äôd recommend Dr. Manjula any day because she is the best out there!¬†

We were not satisfied after every consultation at the same time we noticed Dr. Manjula Deepak in hospital the way she used to interact with her patients also with her colleagues which made me really happy.

Choosing you was a perfect decision made by us as you never gave up your promise of normal delivery.I suggest Dr. Manjula Deepak to all my friends and family members as she is the best friendly doctor to contact who gives dedicated time for individual patient as a family member.And also my husband has told you if we ever plan for second baby we would only prefer you as our doctor. üòçThank you soo much üòç for your love and dedication.Thankyou once again from Prajna and Ravi Nayak and also loads of love from our little champ ‚ù§‚ù§",2021-06-12 13:00:04,False,True,Prajna L,Thank you very much prajna and Ravi for your kind words it means a lot to me,2021-06-25T16:37:11+0000,Dr. Manjula Deepak

And when I got pregnant and met her for the first time I was happy with the way she spoke and her friendly attitude. Since this was my first pregnancy, I had many questions and doubts to ask. Dr.Manjula was very proactive in telling me what kind of body changes can I expect and that kept me well prepared on what to eat what not to eat. How to keep myself active and what are the exercises I need to do. Anytime I text her or call her on any doubts or concern I would get a reply immediately from her. She was the one who made sure I am in safe hands and I would have a safe delivery. To have a happy and peaceful pregnancy I think a good gyno is very important and Dr Manjula is best. She never asked me to take unwanted scans or make me visit the hospital unnecessarily which was most helpful in this pandemic time. Finally I had normal delivery where I, my husband and my family were a little worried since i was over weight but she patiently waited and I had a safe and normal delivery. She takes the right decision at the right time and I am amazed with the way how she is available all the time either at the hospital or on phone. so if your looking for gyno please dont have a second thought. please meet Dr Manjula.

3) she boost confidence in her patients just by her attitude towards the whole phase
4) she is readily available for any questions any hours of the day you message

I was  4 months expecting when I got Covid. At that time we were consulting another doctor in kamanahalli, a doctor with over 40 years of experience. Once after receovering when i contacted the doctor over phone i was asked the question as to why i was calling her. At that point, we decided that i needed to switch from that doctor. I was recommended Dr Manjula at  Cloud9 horamavu by one of my colleagues. 
We went for first meeting with her a bit scared as i had just recovered from covid. But she put us completely at ease. In the first meeting itself she stopped quite a few medicines. At each stage she made us aware of the progress and any issues. At one point the baby was becoming too big so she gave advice on controlling my diet and  we were able to control that. In jan i delivered a healthy baby boy.

I would recommend this extremely high energy, positive and friendly doctor to everybody.

I was induced and got pains starting at 3 AM. mam came in morning around 9 AM for check up and told I would deliver by 11 AM. As expected my pains got intense and my sweet angel came into this world at 10.42 AM.As suggested by mam I use to exercise daily which also helped for NVD.

It was then we were referred to Dr. Manjula and we were awestruck by her immediate response and the way she handled the situation. We were so relieved when she told us baby was doing fine.

She had never suggested any medication and instead she always pressed for a good diet. Most importantly I need to mention the incident happened one day before the delivery. We approached doctor with a scan report on 39th week which says fluid inside the womb is less and it's almost half only. Hence delivery has to happen immediately not to pose any problem for the baby. That time also doctor was saying 'nothing to worry. We will start the procedure today itself and 95 percent chance is there for the delivery to be normal'. And the delivery was normal. I blindly recommend the doctor for anyone.

We would like to recommend Dr. Manjula Deepak to everyone without any second thoughts. She is talented, professional, energetic, friendly and confident. She doesn't have the typical doctor's superior attitude. She treats everyone equally. After the first visit you will never feel that you are going to meet a doctor. It will be like you are going to visit your friend. She by-hearts your name and history in the first visit itself and she will never forget it.  She knows in and out of all patients' history. She used to answer all the queries how silly it is, through whatsapp or over the phone. 

We met her on 2019 on our friend's recommendation. Before meeting her I had two miscarriages as I am a type -II diabetic. In the first consultation itself she promised us a baby by 2020 and now we are blessed with a baby boy. She took all the necessary actions to make my pregnancy sustainable. This care and actions were missing in my previous two pregnancies. I am super happy about Dr. Manjula. She is awesome!!!!!

I referred my colleague to consult the doctor and she also had normal delivery and she thanked us so much for referring and also we are still referring to our friends.

1st pregnancy ‚Äì baby girl, normal delivery. 
During 5th month pregnancy the amniotic fluid was less and there was blockage in placenta, doctor gave proper supplements and the fluid level increased which prevented preterm birth, also the case was placenta previa. Doctor encouraged us and every time we visit we had positive thoughts as she never spoke any negative thing and made sure my wife will have normal delivery which indeed it was full term 40 weeks. Thanks to doctor. 

2nd pregnancy ‚Äì baby boy, normal delivery.
This time throughout pregnancy the amniotic fluid was beyond high range and the baby growth was more also the head circumference was little high which was problem for normal delivery. But doctor gave strict diet to follow and check for fluid level often and after completion of 37 weeks my wife had normal delivery. 

Lastly I have seen doctor in hospital during day time attending patients in OPD with full enthusiasm and positive mood even though she will be in labor ward during night, the way she manage and carry herself is great. Her energy and commitment towards work is inspiration.

She is one who filled positivity in me and my husband in our difficult phase of pregnancy. Ok , let me explain what we went through in our pregnancy journey and how we over came it by Manjula mam. I got pregnant in October 2020 , consulted doctor in another hospital and we got confirmed that we are pregnant. As all others even we were very happy for our baby and initial scans went well. Next came Anamoly scanning where doctor scared us saying baby is growing abnormal and asked us to go for NIPT test. Me and my partner were very much scared to go for it , Later my cousin suggested Manjula mam , we took appointment and went to her. That was the best decision we both made , she saw all our old reports and said all good no need to go for any sort of test and she didn't even asked us to go for Anamoly scanning again , she just asked us to come for growth scanning in 7th month by filling all positivity in us. We trusted her and did our baby's growth scanning too. Issue was baby's weight and it had maintained well. Later again in 8th month there was fluctuations in weight but still doctor didn't scare us and gave me good supplements which really helped baby grow well. All that we were expecting was a healthy baby with good weight. Again in 9th month baby's weight was just 1.8kg , but still doctor didn't scare us and motivated me walhat all to eat and make baby weight gain more. Repeatedly AFI was there to check water level and by mam's and god's grace  we couldn't even  believe baby's weight and water level was maintained well. On June 18th as per doctor's suggestion I delivered my cute little princess through c section and we couldn't believe baby's weight was 2.72KG where in our dreams also we didn't imagine. Even for delivery mam tried max for normal one whole day , since baby's head didn't support at the end she went for immediate c section. Than all , baby was healthy which is most important ‚ò∫Ô∏è All this credits really goes to Manjula mam who made our pregnancy journey go well by delivering healthy baby.

Between weeks 28-35 I had an intuition that my baby's growth in-vitro might have been restricted with reduced baby movements,and when I finally voiced this concern to Dr.Manjula, she immediately guided me on next steps.

She always tried to boost my confidence, and answered all my questions. She is professional, yet friendly, and a trustworthy Doctor.

"Treatment satisfaction,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),Pregnant,",0,0,YES,"The reason we started seeing Dr. Manjula was that we wanted a normal delivery for our baby. In our 38th week scan, we found that the baby had 2 loops of cord around the neck. Baby weight was estimated to be 3.8 kgs. If there were any other doctor, they would have right away done a c-section. 

Dr. Manjula told us that she'd try to deliver the baby naturally but will not rule out emergency c section, should there be a problem with baby's oxygen levels. She suggested us not to wait for natural labor pains to start (which could go up to week 40), by when baby's weight could increase to up to 4 kgs. She induced labor and we were able to deliver the baby naturally without an epidural. Can't thank Dr. Manjula enough for being so patient with us and not scaring us with the usual last minute emergency c-section that other doctors do. Highly recommend her, especially for those seeing normal deliveries.
