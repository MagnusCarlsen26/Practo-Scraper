She is extremely humble and polite. She explains everything required in great detail and I felt good and positive post consultation.I told her my reservations about having a C-section and how I am committed for Normal Delivery. She helped a great deal in explaining the required diet, exercises and lifestyle. She doesn't recommend unnecessary tests or examinations. My husband also felt very realistic and positive about my and baby's health during all consultations.In second trimester, my sugar level came a bit higher than normal and she guided me through the lifestyle to reduce it to normal level in just about a month.All Thanks to Dr. Teji for being there through my pregnancy and rushing to Hospital on a short notice when I got admitted to hospital. I sailed through the Labor for NVD and delivered a healthy baby girl this Decemeber.I strongly recommend Dr. Teji to all women for pregnancy consultations.",

We went for pregnancy checkup and baby delivery, she is very well experienced in genic and obstetrician. Very friendly, explained thoroughly each problem to us.  She will give you enough time to discuss with patient, also self-possessed if patient is anxious. \n\nShe never prescribed unnecessary test and medicines. Dr Teji mostly preferred for normal delivery. For my sister she waited for 12 hr long for normal delivery.\nI will be highly recommend to Dr Teji if you have any pregnancy  issue in Bangalore. Going forward I will continue visiting to her. \n\nA big thanks to Dr Teji :)\n",

In the recent scenario of Covid-19 the way Dr. Teji had responded to my endless queries, given me the best suggestions and kept me happy throughout the journey, I would recommend her to all expecting ladies! She is soft spoken, humble, caring, and a very beautiful human being. There is such an optimistic vibe in her personality which can make an expecting mother feel extremely confident about herself. I couldn't have had a better gynaecologist than her! Thank you very much Dr. Teji ma'am for you constant support.",

She is extremely humble and polite. She explains everything required in great detail and I felt good and positive post consultation.I told her my reservations about having a C-section and how I am committed for Normal Delivery. She helped a great deal in explaining the required diet, exercises and lifestyle. She doesn't recommend unnecessary tests or examinations. My husband also felt very realistic and positive about my and baby's health during all consultations.In second trimester, my sugar level came a bit higher than normal and she guided me through the lifestyle to reduce it to normal level in just about a month.All Thanks to Dr. Teji for being there through my pregnancy and rushing to Hospital on a short notice when I got admitted to hospital. I sailed through the Labor for NVD and delivered a healthy baby girl this Decemeber.I strongly recommend Dr. Teji to all women for pregnancy consultations.",

We went for pregnancy checkup and baby delivery, she is very well experienced in genic and obstetrician. Very friendly, explained thoroughly each problem to us.  She will give you enough time to discuss with patient, also self-possessed if patient is anxious. \n\nShe never prescribed unnecessary test and medicines. Dr Teji mostly preferred for normal delivery. For my sister she waited for 12 hr long for normal delivery.\nI will be highly recommend to Dr Teji if you have any pregnancy  issue in Bangalore. Going forward I will continue visiting to her. \n\nA big thanks to Dr Teji :)\n",

In the recent scenario of Covid-19 the way Dr. Teji had responded to my endless queries, given me the best suggestions and kept me happy throughout the journey, I would recommend her to all expecting ladies! She is soft spoken, humble, caring, and a very beautiful human being. There is such an optimistic vibe in her personality which can make an expecting mother feel extremely confident about herself. I couldn't have had a better gynaecologist than her! Thank you very much Dr. Teji ma'am for you constant support.",

We went to her as my mom was having heavy bleeding and with no knowledge that it was fibroid due to which she had shortage of blood percent like 5% in her body. The doctor explains the problem very nicely and gave many  alternative solutions.  Best part is she is very friendly throughout and after surgery over WhatsApp.  Thanks once again mam. Now my mom is healthy and happy. I started believing doctors are form god's.",

Typical management ever seen in my life.you will not come to know how slowly they will be sucking your money and at last most typical is the receptionist who doesn't know how to talk with patients, my case was missed abortion in which every thing was resolved by medication process and doctor had asked us to meet with her in Manipal for a follow up visit, but management asked us to pay Rs 600 for follow up.i dont understand when there is a follow up visit why they ask for again Rs 600 to pay. Also regarding Scanning/ Ultrasound, manipal is the only one who is taking 2000/- for ultrasound in pregnancy, i recommend everyone to do Scans in some private clinic other wise you will spend minimum 15000 to 20000 in scanning during your while pregnancy..",
