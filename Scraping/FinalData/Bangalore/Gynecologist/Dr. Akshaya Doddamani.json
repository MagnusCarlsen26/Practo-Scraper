I always wanted a vaginal delivery and hence was the reason to visit her as she\u2019s best in this market. The entire pregnancy journey was soo smooth, every concern and doubts were answered by Akshaya with proper explanation. During the last growth scan doctor observed two loops of umbilical cord around my baby\u2019s neck. She made sure we are not affected by this and handled everything with utmost care and confidence. We left everything on her as seeing her confidence made us confident. She was confident that nothing will go wrong and i will have a normal vaginal delivery with me and baby being safe. On the day of delivery she made sure that my baby was constantly monitored via NST during the long labour hours, she was constantly taking updates and taking proper actions to ease my labour journey. I blindly followed all her suggestions and finally delivered a beautiful healthy baby boy without any complications and issues via normal delivery. Her expertise made everything soo easy and hence no wonder why she\u2019s the first choice for many like me who want healthy and safe delivery. She even came to see me post delivery and gave me advises to take care of my health. Words aren\u2019t enough to thank her and I would always recommend her for any pregnancy related issues.",

She also takes time and explains everything in detail whenever we have any doubts and make us feel confident enough which is very much required to handle the pregnancy.She has suggested list of exercises which had really helped me to have a normal delivery possible.\n\nOn the day I went to hospital due to severe contractions and spotting, i had called the doctor and she had adviced me to come down to hospital as soon as possible after listening to all my symptoms. The duty doctor had done the basic tests and took NST continuously and said that baby has done the poop, if it ingests meconium it will lead to health issues for the baby so need to plan for cesarean immediately. we said ok as we were not ready to take any risk interms of baby's health And then Doctor has arrived to hospital and performed few tests and said the risk is anyway same lets do normal delivery only with continuous monitoring but all we need is your cooperation. She was boosting me up continuously in the labour room when i was completely tired due to contractions and has finally made me deliver my baby normally. Also she was asking me how am i feeling and she was there until i felt completely ok and then she has left.\n\nWe are really happy as i delivered normally and both baby and i are healthy and doing fine. \n\nThanks you so much for the commitment doctor. I would really recommend Dr. Akshaya to everyone who is looking for safe and happy delivery.",

From the day 1 of my pregnancy journey I was sure that I came to the best specialist in this field. I always wanted a vaginal delivery and hence was the reason to visit her as she\u2019s best in this market. The entire pregnancy journey was soo smooth, every concern and doubts were answered by Akshaya with proper explanation. During the last growth scan doctor observed two loops of umbilical cord around my baby\u2019s neck. She made sure we are not affected by this and handled everything with utmost care and confidence. We left everything on her as seeing her confidence made us confident. She was confident that nothing will go wrong and i will have a normal vaginal delivery with me and baby being safe. On the day of delivery she made sure that my baby was constantly monitored via NST during the long labour hours, she was constantly taking updates and taking proper actions to ease my labour journey. I blindly followed all her suggestions and finally delivered a beautiful healthy baby boy without any complications and issues via normal delivery. Her expertise made everything soo easy and hence no wonder why she\u2019s the first choice for many like me who want healthy and safe delivery. She even came to see me post delivery and gave me advises to take care of my health. Words aren\u2019t enough to thank her and I would always recommend her for any pregnancy related issues.",

She also takes time and explains everything in detail whenever we have any doubts and make us feel confident enough which is very much required to handle the pregnancy.She has suggested list of exercises which had really helped me to have a normal delivery possible.\n\nOn the day I went to hospital due to severe contractions and spotting, i had called the doctor and she had adviced me to come down to hospital as soon as possible after listening to all my symptoms. The duty doctor had done the basic tests and took NST continuously and said that baby has done the poop, if it ingests meconium it will lead to health issues for the baby so need to plan for cesarean immediately. we said ok as we were not ready to take any risk interms of baby's health And then Doctor has arrived to hospital and performed few tests and said the risk is anyway same lets do normal delivery only with continuous monitoring but all we need is your cooperation. She was boosting me up continuously in the labour room when i was completely tired due to contractions and has finally made me deliver my baby normally. Also she was asking me how am i feeling and she was there until i felt completely ok and then she has left.\n\nWe are really happy as i delivered normally and both baby and i are healthy and doing fine. \n\nThanks you so much for the commitment doctor. I would really recommend Dr. Akshaya to everyone who is looking for safe and happy delivery.",

She was constantly in touch with me whenever i needed (i.e. beating mood swings, harmonal changes, emotionally weak) she was supportive throughout this phase.\n\nMy husband and myself always wanted a normal vaginal delivery. We did our research and decided to go with her.\nFrom your diet, exercise and required medicines she will let you know the do's and don'ts which is best for you n your child. On 8th Jan we welcome our baby girl via normal vaginal delivery. At the time of labour pain she was constantly helping to bear the pain by guiding me to ease it in certain way that helped me at that time. Moreover she is very patient and have positive approach towards the things specially she didn't asked for any tests or anything unless needed.\nPostpartum care was also an unforgettable experience. \nThank You so much doctor for bringing our happiness in this world.\n",

From then only she suggested me the healthy diet, and some exercises. She was soo calm, friendly and lovely. She gave her personal number to clear all my doubts; now also after my delivery she was replying to my  messages, She was so kind hearted. Definitely i would recommend her as gynecologist for my family members and friends. My water was suddenly broke at my 37 weeks of early pregnancy without any pain. In my home we didn't expected this at that time and everyone was scared of that. Immediately we started to hospital. After reaching the hospital they immediately started the treatment. My water was broken at 12pm and we reached the hospital by 2pm. After Starting the treatment, the pains started from 4:30pm; I was panicked at that time when real pain started on that time Ahshaya mam was with me from 5pm and helped during that time to overcome of pain and encouraged me to give vaginal birth. At 6:28pm I'm blessed with baby boy. Without Akshaya Mam my delivery would be very painful and complicated. Today  me and my baby was healthy because of Dr. Ahshaya mam and I'm very thankful to her.",

The duty doctor and scan doctor after looking at the NST and scan said the babies breathing was fluctuating and need to plan for cesarean immediately. We explained the situation to Akshaya mam, she came to hospital immediately and assured a normal delivery with continuous monitoring. \nShe did stand by her words and I delivered normally. Our family is greatful to her, my baby and I are doing perfectly fine. \nThanks for the dedication and commitment doc. I would recommend Dr.Akshaya to everyone who is looking for safe and happy delivery.",

I have been consulting her from July month for my pregnancy and the delivery which made me more positive by visiting her.  every time we visit she spoke to us so friendly and positively about the health condition and gave a hope for the normal delivery which is very rare nowadays.  I was surprised with her positiveness towards patients with smile on her face which makes us feel very comfortable.  as she mentioned I had normal delivery on 20 th August and till the delivery and even after the delivery she is very good to us and *** ** *** **** ****** I would recommend to all my friends...  she is the gifted doctor and who ever meet her with a health issue am sure half of the issue will be solved by speaking to her.  I will recommend people to visit ovum hospital just because of Dr Akshaya  because she is the gifted doctor and people need such a experienced doctors.  kudos to Dr Akshaya and also Dr Shravan ,Dr Abhishek who were too supportive also thanks to the staff.  it was a great pleasure .

I got conceived by March 2023. Truly, visiting her is the best thing we have decided. Throughout the pregnancy journey she was very supportive, always had a positive approach for any problem and replied anytime we message her through the WhatsApp. She did my C section operation even though she was pregnant and her due date was the very next week of mine. Truly admire her professionalism.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Akshaya for anyone who is trying to get pregnant and/or pregnant.",

But for some reason me and my hubby were not confident on the Doctor's treatment and suggestions, cos I had PCOD issues and so was advised by one of our relatives to consult Dr.Akshaya Doddamani from Ovum, Hosakote. Though the hospital was quite far from my place, I decided to consult Dr. Akshaya Doddamani Mam in Ovum hospital, Hosakote, from 4th month of my pregnancy. I must say that was the best decision I had ever taken in my life. Dr. Akshaya is very friendly and kind in explaining things. No mater how worried we are about things, her subtle reactions and suggestions would ease our fears and fill in confidence. She was always available for my calls and msgs, throughout my pregnancy, despite her busy schedule. Her positivity helped me to handle the pregnancy so well. Since my water levels were slightly low and Akshaya mam was not so happy with the NST reports, around my due date,  mam suggested, induced labour and we agreed for the same. On the day of my labour, though, I created a huge ruckus and the nursing staff told me that I was completely uncooperative, and Akshaya mam was literally worried, since in the beginning of the labour process itself I was shouting like anything and was stressed out as if I was in the verge of delivery. However, the kind of positive vibe that I received in the labor room by Akshaya mam is something which I can't express through words. Her calculations were very accurate in each and every aspect. Any other Doctor in her place would have definitely suggested C-section, citing the stress that I was going through during the labour and also since the baby's weight was slightly more for a normal delivery. My hubby told later, that at that point even he had lost hopes and thought it would be Caesarean only. But, even in that stage, Akshaya mam told that she would break the water and see, and if the water is clear she said she would still prefer normal delivery. Finally, with all her efforts and support, I delivered a healthy baby boy much before the expected time, through normal delivery. My entire family is extremely happy and thankful to Dr. Akshaya mam.I strongly recommend her for each and every mother who wants to go through a safe pregnancy...Thank you Dr. Akshaya Mam for your guidance, advice and support during this beautiful pregnancy journey of mine.",

I was following her instructions regularly from the date I had visited, lastly she said that baby is in correct down position and may get labour pain within a week. Unfortunately labour pain did not come naturally within a week, so she told me that not to wait more as it may lead to unnecessary c section. Finally as per her words, got admitted and delivered baby boy normally. Thanks to Akshaya mam for making my delivery memorable\u263a\ufe0f",

She is very friendly and was available on WhatsApp throughout my pregnancy. Sometimes we had called her  at odd timing and she was very quick to take action and was available immediately on WhatsApp. She always encouraged me to do normal delivery and guided us with all the excercises for normal delivery.I  do recommend Dr Akshaya Mam to all the people who are looking for best gynaecologist.\nWe are blessed with a baby boy on 22 feb .\nThank you very much Mam once again for all your help and guidance \u263a\ufe0f.",

The way she did the check up and the way she explained everything is amazing. She is caring and she is always available when in need. She keeps checking with the patients personally. I'm very thankful to Dr. For making my pregnancy easy and normal. Because of various health issues we were scared but Dr. Akshaya made everything achievable. She accepted and understood all my requests. Even when I was not so cooperative she was very patient with me through out the labour. We delivered a baby girl on 7th Jan 22 normally with the help and guidance of her.",

In this preterm cases other docters always prefers cisarian. it was an amazing moment for us. we blessed to have a doctor like Akshaya for our 1st baby. this review is not for rating her work, this is small effort to spread her goodness. infact, I don't have enough of starts even in the sky to rate her work and care she has taken in our case. Thank you so much for all your support and care you showed on us Mam, you will be in our hearts for ever _/|\\_",

Thank you so much Dr Akshaya, may God bless you!\n\nOn the other hand, few things for the hospital management that disappointed us...as hygiene is a top priority besides baby's well-being, the room was not clean adequately/on time, dustbins (sanitary pads/napkins) not cleared for a day, bathroom water running out (just delivered a baby, need to cleanse frequently) and not able to cleanse or pass motions as there was no water, too noisy (especially people talking/laughing/shouting).",

For us, it has been a beautiful journey from the time we came to realize that we are to be parents few months down the line. Initial apprehensions and confusions were all very easily subsided by the strong guidance and support offered by Dr Akshaya and though times have been difficult outside for most of us, we still were able to stay at ease throughout the journey. Dr Akshaya has always been there for my wife during and post pregnancy, and the kind of person she is, a patient ends up a friend. She made sure that everything has been taken care to minutest detail during my wife\u2019s pregnancy. She supported and helped prepare my wife for delivery. The kind of dedication we have witnessed is just too extraordinary to be explained in words. Thank you so much for your support, guidance, efforts, care, and everything!  ",

Always available on call for any queries.\nShe is much experienced and very good at progressive treatment, and ask to take scans with right interval to ensure proper growth of baby and mother\u2019s health and never ask for unnecessary tests and scans.\nMy wife got delivered on 12th July 2021 and the day was real nightmare. She was under pains for more than 12 hours , I and my wife gave up and demanded Dr. Akshaya to perform C section, and she never agreed.\nShe kept monitoring baby\u2019s heart rate and we held our nerves and fingers crossed.\nFinally she succeeded in performing normal delivery and all cherished. \nSalute to her bravery. \nYou are looking for normal delivery, visit Ovum hospital Hoskote and consult Dr. Akshaya.\n ",

She avoids taking in more medicines and enforcing to maintain a healthy daily routine that I like the most. She always insists on exercises and proper diet as per the symptoms and for normal delivery. We had a normal delivery as she promised in the beginning which is very unlikely these days. Many Thanks to Dr. Akshaya for one of the best experiences that she offered to us. I'll definitely refer more to consult her whoever takes my opening on this.",

She's like a friend and listens to every minute detail and makes sure you leave her chamber in peace and with a clear mind. \nShe never prescribed any unnecessary medications or scans. Even staff were very helpful and kind in OT.\nThankful to Dr. Akshaya and entire ovum hospitals staff",

She never prescribed unnecessary scans, tests or medicines. We wanted a normal delivery as it was our first baby. Dr. Akshaya is a pro for normal delivery. Doctor always counselled us to go for normal delivery. It was a long labour. Baby had passed meconium. Still doctor didn't give up her hopes and kept motivating us. And we are blessed with a baby boy through normal delivery. She has been a guide, mentor and friend for us. Always grateful to her.",

She is one of the finest doctors I have ever come across and I have visited quite a few as it was my first pregnancy. Shes friendly, polite, humble and addresses every concern, if , you may have. In this day and age, she always encouraged me for a normal delivery from day one unlike other doctors. My family and I would definitely recommend her rather highly recommend her and to add even if you are coming from mysore road you can consult her, trust me it would be worth it. She made my pregnancy experience memorable even With so much paranoia that I had, she makes her patients feel very  comfortable from detailed explanation of the procedure to giving tips for healthy pregnancy and normal delivery.

Then we went to Dr. Akshaya madam (through a friend who referred us to her). She said she will examine and then decide. Later she said she will try her best for normal delivery and admitted my wife. Doctor was with her throughout her labour. She was a guide and a friend in the most difficult stage of pregnancy.  After 8 hours of labour, my wife delivered a healthy baby girl. We are always thankful to you madam. You are one among the very few doctors who genuinely try for normal delivery thinking about the best interest s of mother and baby. We can never forget you in our life.",

You should be lucky enough to find the doctor *** ** *** **** ** *** ***** *** at the same time friendly, in the most important stage of your life. I am glad for the decision I took. It's hard to find a doctor like her who gives you 24*7 support............ very approachable. She tries her best for normal delivery even if u insist her for C section and makes the labour journey very pleasant. She was with me throughout my labour. And we were blessed with a baby girl. We owe a big thanks to you. So ladies who stay in and around Hoskote, I strongly recommend you Dr.Akshaya, who is the star of Ovum hospital.

Treats us like a family. Doesn't leave a stone unturned in caring her patients. We went to her for a second opinion when my previous doc advised cesarean for a complication at 31 weeks. With her explanation of problem and positive attitude, we decided to stick to her and followed her advise. We started feeling we are in safe hands. With her immense care and support, we had a baby at full term and delivered normally. She has been an angel in disguise. ",
