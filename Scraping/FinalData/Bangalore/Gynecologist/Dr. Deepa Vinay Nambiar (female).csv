Not only it brings a wave of happiness but makes a woman anxious with anticipation. During this time it‚Äôs not just your partner, family and friends but your gynaecologist who makes this 9 months journey comforting and memorable.

We consulted Dr Deepa for my first pregnancy after recommendation of a friend and reading reviews about Shanthi women‚Äôs health center in google. In addition to a pleasant personality she is very calm and patient while listening to a woman. She understands the restlessness and anxiety of a pregnant woman and answers all the questions that one might have. She explains various aspects in detail about why, when and how certain things should be done that always help to make informed decisions leaving you satisfied. It‚Äôs imp to mention that she always explains various options without imposition whether it‚Äôs the lab or hospital to be chosen or procedures that one may opt for. 

Well we are most happy to have chosen her as our doctor. The lockdown in the year 2020 has been uplifting for us with the blessing of a baby girl in our house. At the end would like to thank Dr Deepa for being there at all times even during the lockdown.
