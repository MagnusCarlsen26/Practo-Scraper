She helped me with understanding the problem as I had visited two more doctors earlier and they had suggested me to undergo chemo as the reports were inappropriate/ ambiguous. Amrita mam was the one who asked to get it retested since the report was ambiguous/not clear. After retest/reassessment she prescribed me appropriate medicines and it was successful. I conceived naturally post that, however I had twin babies and to my bad luck both of them didn\u2019t have heartbeat and had to abort it. She helped me get through this physical & emotional stress. Now we are blessed with a lovely baby gal, not to mention again, we consulted her again for our pre and post delivery care. Our baby is healthy, her medicine prescriptions were accurate, and was always available for any of my medical issues over phone/whatsapp. Kudos to Amrita mam. She is a busy doctor in this city, so please don\u2019t expect any casual talks,  she talks strictly to the point. Some people feel she is rude but she isn\u2019t so. Even in OT during the surgery, she held my hand and was very encouraging, filling all the confidence that I was losing out looking at so many people there. She said it\u2019s gonna be alright and it was all right!!! Thank you Amrita for standing beside me in this difficult journey of mine!!",

She helped me with understanding the problem as I had visited two more doctors earlier and they had suggested me to undergo chemo as the reports were inappropriate/ ambiguous. Amrita mam was the one who asked to get it retested since the report was ambiguous/not clear. After retest/reassessment she prescribed me appropriate medicines and it was successful. I conceived naturally post that, however I had twin babies and to my bad luck both of them didn\u2019t have heartbeat and had to abort it. She helped me get through this physical & emotional stress. Now we are blessed with a lovely baby gal, not to mention again, we consulted her again for our pre and post delivery care. Our baby is healthy, her medicine prescriptions were accurate, and was always available for any of my medical issues over phone/whatsapp. Kudos to Amrita mam. She is a busy doctor in this city, so please don\u2019t expect any casual talks,  she talks strictly to the point. Some people feel she is rude but she isn\u2019t so. Even in OT during the surgery, she held my hand and was very encouraging, filling all the confidence that I was losing out looking at so many people there. She said it\u2019s gonna be alright and it was all right!!! Thank you Amrita for standing beside me in this difficult journey of mine!!",
