,,0,0,NO,"I would not recommend this doctor. I went to them to get treatment for PCOS, they enquired of all the symptoms I was facing and was understanding until they asked me if I was married and trying to have kids. When I said no, I'm not married or trying to have kids. They told me to return to them only when I was married and not to worry about it until I wanted to get pregnant. They finally recommended some tests only after I explained how much the symptoms were affecting me and was almost in tears. 

It's very disappointing that my health issues were not taken seriously because I was not trying to get pregnant. ** ****** ********* *** *** ****** ** *** ********* * ***** ***** ***** ** **** ******* ",2021-06-22 08:31:04,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
