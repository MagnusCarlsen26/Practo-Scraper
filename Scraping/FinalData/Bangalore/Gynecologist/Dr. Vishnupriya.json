She helped bring a perfect miracle into our lives We're grateful to have worked with such a knowledgeable, friendly doctor.\n Initially there were some issues in my pregnancy like hematoma and low lying placenta, bleeding issues but with mam's instructions all these issues were resolved smoothly. My every query ans concern she listened and solved not only during consultation but on whatsapp also she always responded instantly by which i felt very much relaxed.\nshe always guided on what diet to follow how to have healthy pregnancy and By 7th month all my issues were gone and i was ready for normal delivery. on delivery day everything was going smoothly amd Mam was there to monitor constantly like my elder sister she was motivating me to handle the contractions without panicking. But somehow things didn't go well in the end as my cervix was not dilating after 13 hrs of labor pain and even after so many efforts  and as i was not able to handle the pain so i finally decided to go for c sec delivery but i don't regret as Mam was there to monitor my delivery through c sec  so i was totally relaxed and everything went so well. I still remember the moment when Vishnupriya Mam showed the first glimpse of my baby boy. It was indeed World's best feeling. With  Mam's motivation i recovered quiet quickly and was able to walk comfortably within 2,3 days of my C sec\nI would recommend Aster women and children hospital and Vishnupriya Mam as the perfect gynac and hospital for pregnancy. Thanku so so much Mam \ud83e\udd17",

She, however, also possesses the very important quality of being compassionate towards her patients. I had visited her while I was planning my pregnancy at the age of 34, and she always gave us the confidence that with a healthy lifestyle, we can conceived naturally, which we did. \n\nUntil I met her, like many around me, I too always thought I would opt for c-section for my delivery. It is because of Dr. Vishnupriya, this outlook of mine changed, and I delivered a healthy baby boy through normal vaginal delivery. Throughout my delivery, she ensured that I kept a track of my weight, worked out regularly and took long walks. It is because of this, unlike a lot of women, I didn\u2019t gain extra weight and was able to bounce back to my old self in less than 2 months of having my baby. :)\n\nDr. Vishnupriya is friendly, considerate, a good listener, and provides pragmatic solution for problems. \nWould I refer her to others? Absolutely yes. ",

I trusted and followed her blinding during my pregnancy journey. I would really recommend her for high risk pregnancy. \nShe has taken care of everything Like diet plan, lifestyle changes. She is available all the time  on phone as well. She will make you  feel very comfortable so that you can ask any silly questions without any hesitation. With her guidance and support only, I was able to deliver my baby vaginally. \nThanks a lot Mam for everything.",

She is kind, compassionate, and patient and takes the time to address any concerns (I am kind of a person with lots of questions), no matter how big or small they may seem. I feel blessed that she took such wonderful care of me as I had a lot of complications with my baby in my pregnancy and she was the person to bring my girl into this world. Thank you so much from the bottom of hearts for taking such good care of us during/after the pregnancy as well as the delivery! We always felt like we were in good hands and that gave us peace of mind towards the big day. Thank you for helping deliver the most precious gift of our life!!\n\nI would strongly recommend her because even today she makes sure to check on us to see if me and baby are doing well. No matter what and when she will always be available. Anytime you need her, she is there  ready.\n\nSpecial Note to Dr. Vishnu Priya\nMam, I and my husband personally vow a lot of respect for you and will continue to do so. You make sure to check on us and that's really a sweet gesture which makes us confident that we have someone to support us. Even today you are our hope for any recommendations.",

This was my first time in Bangalore. After a couple of searches for suitable hospitals, zeroed in on Aster Women & Children Hospital based on consultation with Dr. Vishnu Priya there.\n\nDr. Vishnu Priya speaks softly but with firmness based on her in-depth knowledge. Her friendliness and detailed explanation of the medical issues with transparency and lucidity to patient and family members are highly appreciative. Options of treatment available with her complete clarifications facilitate to agree to follow the subsequent procedure as per demand of the situation. \n\nLaparoscopic surgery was done by her successfully and I am happy with the procedure which went off smoothly. \n\nHer personal care at pre and post surgery like a family member qualifies a special mention.\n\nThe overall hospital cleanliness and hygiene is excellent. Associated medical services are prompt and 24/7 available. The coordinator, Ms. Moulin, is very helpful and supportive whenever needed she responded positively.",

She helped bring a perfect miracle into our lives We're grateful to have worked with such a knowledgeable, friendly doctor.\n Initially there were some issues in my pregnancy like hematoma and low lying placenta, bleeding issues but with mam's instructions all these issues were resolved smoothly. My every query ans concern she listened and solved not only during consultation but on whatsapp also she always responded instantly by which i felt very much relaxed.\nshe always guided on what diet to follow how to have healthy pregnancy and By 7th month all my issues were gone and i was ready for normal delivery. on delivery day everything was going smoothly amd Mam was there to monitor constantly like my elder sister she was motivating me to handle the contractions without panicking. But somehow things didn't go well in the end as my cervix was not dilating after 13 hrs of labor pain and even after so many efforts  and as i was not able to handle the pain so i finally decided to go for c sec delivery but i don't regret as Mam was there to monitor my delivery through c sec  so i was totally relaxed and everything went so well. I still remember the moment when Vishnupriya Mam showed the first glimpse of my baby boy. It was indeed World's best feeling. With  Mam's motivation i recovered quiet quickly and was able to walk comfortably within 2,3 days of my C sec\nI would recommend Aster women and children hospital and Vishnupriya Mam as the perfect gynac and hospital for pregnancy. Thanku so so much Mam \ud83e\udd17",

She, however, also possesses the very important quality of being compassionate towards her patients. I had visited her while I was planning my pregnancy at the age of 34, and she always gave us the confidence that with a healthy lifestyle, we can conceived naturally, which we did. \n\nUntil I met her, like many around me, I too always thought I would opt for c-section for my delivery. It is because of Dr. Vishnupriya, this outlook of mine changed, and I delivered a healthy baby boy through normal vaginal delivery. Throughout my delivery, she ensured that I kept a track of my weight, worked out regularly and took long walks. It is because of this, unlike a lot of women, I didn\u2019t gain extra weight and was able to bounce back to my old self in less than 2 months of having my baby. :)\n\nDr. Vishnupriya is friendly, considerate, a good listener, and provides pragmatic solution for problems. \nWould I refer her to others? Absolutely yes. ",

Dr Vishnu Priya was able to diagnose and explain my complication and started the line of treatment  from day 1 . I also had Thyroid and got Gestational Diabetes in the 3rd Trimester . Dr gave me the best line of treatment for controlling both the conditions . Not just Dr Vishny Priya is a great Gynaec , She is also an excellent counselor .  Being a first time mom I had a lot of questions and everytime she answered them with a lot of patience .She is very loving, caring and gives a lot of time in understanding and listening to your issues.

She is kind, compassionate, and patient and takes the time to address any concerns (I am kind of a person with lots of questions), no matter how big or small they may seem. I feel blessed that she took such wonderful care of me as I had a lot of complications with my baby in my pregnancy and she was the person to bring my girl into this world. Thank you so much from the bottom of hearts for taking such good care of us during/after the pregnancy as well as the delivery! We always felt like we were in good hands and that gave us peace of mind towards the big day. Thank you for helping deliver the most precious gift of our life!!\n\nI would strongly recommend her because even today she makes sure to check on us to see if me and baby are doing well. No matter what and when she will always be available. Anytime you need her, she is there  ready.\n\nSpecial Note to Dr. Vishnu Priya\nMam, I and my husband personally vow a lot of respect for you and will continue to do so. You make sure to check on us and that's really a sweet gesture which makes us confident that we have someone to support us. Even today you are our hope for any recommendations.",

She was very very supportive during the entire process and her suggestions helped a lot in having Normal Delivery.\nwe can confidently say, she never recommends any unnecessary procedures or medicines and would always recommend patients to go for normal delivery. \nAlso Dr. Vishnupriya is Exceptional Human Being because we always accompanied with our first 4 1/2 year girl kid and our kid was very naughty as well as\ndesire to know or learn in Dr. Vishnupriya consultation room but as i said before Dr. Vishnupriya is exceptional human being to answer and support my kids all\nkind of curiosity.

This was my first time in Bangalore. After a couple of searches for suitable hospitals, zeroed in on Aster Women & Children Hospital based on consultation with Dr. Vishnu Priya there.\n\nDr. Vishnu Priya speaks softly but with firmness based on her in-depth knowledge. Her friendliness and detailed explanation of the medical issues with transparency and lucidity to patient and family members are highly appreciative. Options of treatment available with her complete clarifications facilitate to agree to follow the subsequent procedure as per demand of the situation. \n\nLaparoscopic surgery was done by her successfully and I am happy with the procedure which went off smoothly. \n\nHer personal care at pre and post surgery like a family member qualifies a special mention.\n\nThe overall hospital cleanliness and hygiene is excellent. Associated medical services are prompt and 24/7 available. The coordinator, Ms. Moulin, is very helpful and supportive whenever needed she responded positively.",

She was always proactive to offer me right guidance whenever I had any issues or queries. Though she is busy but still she ensures she gives adequate time to her patients. \nI was going through multiple family illness issues. As a result , I was bit delayed for few of the check ups with her but nothing was blocker to her. She treated me and offered her consultation /support remotely . Through out my journey of pregnancy , I found her beside me, in fact beside my family. Her conversations are always encouraging. I was well assured of a smooth sailing pregnancy and delivery under her treatment. I wish I knew her for my 1st child delivery as well. My heartfelt thanks to Dr. Vishnupriya. The way she is marching ahead with exceptional knowledge, right attitude towards patient and to her job, soon she will be one of the most sought after doctor of town - I am so sure about that. My best wishes!",

Before I share my experience I would like to thank you Dr. Vishnupriya mam and her team for your care during my first pregnancy and delivery. You made the time pass quickly during labor! \n\n\nDr. Vishnupirya is incredible. Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It\u2019s rare to find a doctor who combines such personal touches and cares for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care.\n\nI found the hospital online(google) and made an appointment. During the first trimester, I was feeling very weak because of nausea and vomiting, And after consultation with Dr Vishnupriya Mam, I gained some strength. Until last trimester all the problems were handled by mam very well. Dr Vishnupriya is not only a Doctor but she took care of me like a family member. My delivery was quick and we stayed 48 hours at the hospital. This place is unique and I admire to the hospital staff for their true commitment during the stay.  A really easy process and a good experience. \n\n\nThank You to all the staff of Aster Women and Children Hospital for their service. Special thanks to Dr. Vishnupriya mam for her support and consultation. This place is great for those who want to consultation on pregnancy and delivery. ",

And I believe that visit with Dr. Vishnupriya was the best decision I had taken. \nMaam had explained the seriousness of the issue and explained so well the best treatment options available. From our first visit, Maam was so pleasant and supportive emotionally to both me and mom. With the best option of laproscopic hysterectomy available and Dr. Vishnupriya being an expert in the field, I knew my mom were in the best hands. The procedure went well and maam was regularly updating me about mom's condition and that honestly gave me so much strength.I always recommend Dr.Vishnupriya for all the patients who arein need of the best quality health care.\nI would always be grateful to maam \ud83d\ude4f ",

My first thought when I met her was she is very cool doctor and she dint give us unnecessary tensions. Too many ups and downs during pregnancy is common but as a first time mother I was really tensed for few changes but doctor helped us to overcome all those. Sometimes when i missed for check up doctor used to check on us through phone which was really a sweet gesture. Doctor was with us untill my baby in my hands and you call or message her anytime she will be there for us. I really cant forget her throughout my life. If you are reading this I would highly recommend you, can trust her without any doubts.Lifetime much of love and gratitude for Dr.Vishnupriya and for my husband who choosed this doctor:) ",

Though I was in my late 30s during my 2nd pregnancy I did not face any complications and went for normal delivery. Both my pregnancy journey was very smooth. Dr. Vishnupriya doesn't stress you and always comforts you with proper guidance. She is flexible and reachable during emergency.  I would highly recommend  her if u r looking for best gynecologist.  She even maintains a cordial relationship with our family members which  is the best part. I wish her all the best for her career journey. \n ",

Incidentally, tried calling Manipal Hospital but was not able to connect and then we tried Aster, Dr was available. All our apprehensions went within the first meeting where I found her to be very detailed as she went about asking lot of questions till the prognosis was correct. Her diagnosis was spot on and she was able to comfort my wife immediately. Though the procedure is so-called simple but doctor was there all through, explaining in details and answering every question relevant or not. She also explained merits and demerits. There was no rush whenever we met and during the whole experience we met her in clinic 5 times and was also admitted for 2 days. \n\nReally happy with the handling overall and would like to thanks Dr Vishnupriya for making the experience better.",

She explained in detail the root cause - how fibroid overgrowth has caused such drastically Low Hemoglobin count. As a solution, she has done the Laparoscopic surgery for Uterus removal.

After doing some search and getting references from friends, we approached Dr. Vishnu Priya. She explained us the option of Laproscopic Hystrectomy and gave us confidence to undergo the same. We are very happy to state that the complex surgery went smoothly and I was discharged by 3rd day of surgery. Post-surgery recovery was very fast, I was able to resume normal work within a weeks\u2019 time. Thanks to Dr. Vishnu Priya and entire hospital team. ",
