It's all because of my beautiful doctor..  \ud83d\ude0a I have seen many people struggle throughout their pregnancy because of myths and unable to express their problems infront of doctors,  as doctors will not be friendly or many will not understand ur problems..  But for me everything was stress free.. \n Dr Vinutha  took extreme care of me and my baby..  I was very comfortable..  All thanks to you doc and your team..  \nThanks a lottt from me and my baby.. \ud83d\ude0d\nEven she waited for hours, as we were waiting for normal delivery..  Finally I couldn't tolerate..  I only requested to do cesarean..  Everything was so smooth..  Am extremely happy...\ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udd17\nFor everyone in my circle  I will  advise them to go to my doctor thats quality of care they provided me... ",

She has been the ONLY gynecologist who was patient, meticulously took notes, and explained the whole scenario before consulting me on how I would like to proceed! Ma'am even came down to the scanning room so she could see for herself. Since I already have a pre existing condition, she went the extra mile to cautiously treat me. She took every precaution so I would be comfortable, and more importantly, healthy and back on my feet!\nI have NEVER, not in all these years of being a woman, met a gynecologist who was as professional and brilliant as Dr. Vinutha. \nI have had gynecologists who have shamed me in every way possible, except for Dr. Vinutha. She is one of the most kind and gentle doctors I've met. \nShe personally followed up to see how I was doing post treatment!\nI would definitely recommend her. 15/10\n(Yes, that is how good she is!)",
