In addition to being an expert at her field, her genial and affable nature makes her very approachable and gives that added comfort to patients.

,,0,0,NO,"I am a PCOD patient and suffered from constant pain. We went to Dr Ramapriya for second opinion and she is one of the most unfriendly doctors i have ever met! *** *** ** **** ** *** ** **** *** ***** Made me repeat *********** blood tests and ultrasound at very unhygienic places while I had the records a month back from clumax and Ragav. The only thing she recommended was D&C procedure and sadly after further review from some of the folks in our community, i heard that's her first solution to all problems. I ended up never visiting her post reviews. ****** *** **** ****** ********** *** shows no empathy or skills. DO NOT GO TO HER! ",2022-09-16 08:55:16,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
,"Gynae Problems,",0,0,NO,"The doctor only kept redirecting me to her clinic. The consultation fees paid was wasted. She did not even write the blood tests down that she wanted me to do because she specifically wanted me to do them at her clinic. Also, for a 10:30 AM appointment, the clinic staff kept saying 10 mins 10 mins till she came at 11 AM - the Practo guarantee of 15 mins doesn’t mean anything. Absolutely horrible experience. DO NOT VISIT!",2022-05-28 06:57:51,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
