"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I visited Dr. Bharathi Rajanna as i was struggling to get pregnant.
After 10 years of marriage it is very difficult to convince both ourselves and society for not having child, and we were very much exhausted by taking too many medicines. Then one of our fiend gave the reference of Dr. Bharathi Rajanna and we visited to her and in our first meeting only i told her that madam i want to go to IVF as i cant wait more to have a baby, she was too patient and listed our problems calmly and asked me to do some blood tests and come back after we went to her with report she explained me the problems in a very simpler manner which i can understand asked me to reduce my weight once and then if that also did not work out then we will go for next level is what she told(She rejected to go for IVF, which shows her empathy/kindness/genuineness). And with her constant help, support and proper guidance i conceived naturally and delivered safely for a girl baby.
Thank you soo much madam, with out your support my pregnancy would have been a nightmare. ",2021-04-08 03:53:55,False,True,Pruthvi,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"What seemed like a distant dream for me and my husband was made a reality by Dr. Bharathi Rajanna. When our initial efforts of conceiving a child met with no success, disappointment was writ large on our faces. In an opportune moment, a family friend advised us to consult Dr. Bharathi Rajanna. She did study my case comprehensively and opined that there isn't a reason to worry and advised that I turn towards a healthier lifestyle. She said that I need transformation rather than treatment. As the days passed by, I felt confident and had positive vibes. Although it took over 8 months, I conceived naturally and that too with twins. :) Throughout my pregnancy, the doctor guided me like a mother and never did I face any issues whatsoever. I'm indebted to her forever. Shortly after my twin daughters turned two, I conceived again with a singleton. With the pandemic raging all across, I was obviously worried about medical management during pregnancy. The doctor was always available over call and I felt assured throughout. I delivered a baby boy towards the end of third trimester and there was no limit to the joy of our family.
