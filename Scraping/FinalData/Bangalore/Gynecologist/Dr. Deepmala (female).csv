Then she patiently answered the questions related to the issue , provided encouragement, and ensured that my comfort was prioritized throughout the entire process.

Her approach was less medicines more meditation and yoga . She gave only multivitamin to my husband and iron to me and within one month we got positive results. This time both me and doctor were more cautious she took all the necessary steps to make my pregnancy viable. My first trimester was a bumpy ride where i got spotting pain and what not she gave me injections and every time I visited her her smile made me more confident and positive. During my third trimester sometimes I use to feel less baby movements for that she use to call me and check how I am feeling. I never saw any doctor calling her patient to check there well being. She is just amazing. During my 37 th week I got lose stool which we got to know later was due to Covid. She delivered my baby immediately. I was very scared that being Covid positive I should not breast feed my angel but she again gave me the boost I needed and I continue breastfeeding. Now my baby is 1 month old. All I have is gratitude and thankfulness in my heart for Doctor Deepmala. She is one of the best doctor I have ever seen. I will always recommend her.

She is intelligent, calm, helpful and compassionate. Her approach towards every pregnancy stage was very natural; be it diet or medication. Every pregnant woman is different and she knows it very well as she handled my wife’s issues uniquely and accurately.
Each time we go to her, she would listen to us very carefully. She pays attention to each and every doubt with equal sincerity. As a first time pregnancy, we used to be confused and worried a bit. But she gave us confidence at every stage and made sure that both mother and baby are doing good. You will have many small questions/issues during the pregnancy and she was very active in responding on WhatsApp every time; be it day or night. This helped us a lot throughout our pregnancy.
Coming to the delivery phase, she made sure that mother and the baby is healthy to be delivered by doing all the required tests. We thank you, Dr. Deepmala, for a wonderful experience. Thank you for everything, you have a lioness’s share in the joy that our baby’s birth has given us.

At 35 week when I had AFI+doppler scan, all our peace was gone when we got to know that our baby had 2 loops of cord around her neck(first pregnancy). Ma’m suggested C-sec immediately if we dont want to take the slightest risk but was also very supportive when we dint want to undergo csec all of a sudden as we were worried for the baby’s growth. She suggested to track baby movements, any slight change in that we were asked to rush to emergency room, and every 3rd day we had to get an NST done. She supported us very well through this and was always available over call and chat. I finally delivered the baby at 37wks+3 days  elective csec as baby’s movements were lesser than before, heartbeat was not as stable as always, mucous plus was out before which brown discharge had started, cervix had opened 2cm and baby was nowhere near pelvis. Ma’m always told us that she will support us till baby and mother are safe, once she finds anything unstable she will ask us to undergo csection. She supported us till the end. I am forever grateful to ma’m for staying with us through our first pregnancy and the tough times in it.
