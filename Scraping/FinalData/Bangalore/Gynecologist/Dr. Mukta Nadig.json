She was so humble and approachable, cleared all my apprehensions and queries so patiently. The best part is she remembers the history of the case and gives the best treatment. She examines very carefully and explains the medical conditions and their aids in the most comfortable manner. Her advice and medication has been extremely beneficial throughout the period. She is an expert in her field, very confident but very down to earth. She hears your concern ( personal too ), asks how u feel and tries to make the journey as amicable as possible. Explains each and every step throughout the pregnancy from a test to tablet that's prescribed. She talks to you before the procedure, during and after as well in such a sweet manner. She was so understanding and always added a personal touch to everything. We traveled from a distance to consult her  she used to keep all the tests, consultation and any such to one single date a month to limit the frequent visits. She was present through my long labour and delivery. This platform falls short of praising her rather \u2018thank you\u2019 seems so trivial. Any words of appreciation will be less for the kind of advice, strength and support that she has provided us in all these months. We truly enjoyed our pregnancy journey with her and were blessed with a healthy baby girl on May 15th.Thank you once again ma'am and we highly recommend her for all the future parents to be. She's a gem. ",

In the last trimester due to genetics when i was diagnosed with gestational diabetes..she did not scare me or did not even try to scare me but guided me further well with which i was able to deliver vaginally without epidural (again she did not force me and left the decision on me)..also when my placenta did not deliver naturally she was quick enough to manually deliver it in time...overall she was the main reason for us to select the hospital altogether and v were more than happy with her..i guess this is what is called as experience speaks... Finally this was my story where she helped me deliver vaginally though i had gestational diabetes, hypothyroidism and my baby weighed 3.44kg at birth.. kudos to all the positive energy she fills in which inturn helps u gain confidence n trust on ur own body... She always said me that all these GDM, thyroid etc is not a factor to not have normal delivery as long as we follow a healthy lifestyle and she proved it.. also not to forget even in the labour room she made sure i was hydrated and had the energy to push and also followed up with my baby's pediatrician once he was born too..\nThanks a ton again doctor...infact now that the consultations have ended we really miss the consultations which always gave us those positive vibes..you are truly an inspiration!!\n\nBrownie points: her calculations are so apt that my baby weighed almost the same kgs that she had said us.. also her guidance on exercises helped me dilate faster..\nShe was there in the labour room even before the duty doctor called her to inform the status and at the right time(though it was late night)(she knew by when i would be dilated enough to deliver too) <3",

My wife (Harshini) was apprehensive,excited, nervous, scared, jittery and tensed;  she was basically in unknown territory! \n\nAppointment taken and we were waiting! Those few minutes felt like forever!! Dr.Mukta welcomed us into the room and she spoke to us just like a friend. She comforted us and asked us the routine questions; she advised us to go for a pregnancy test. The following weekend, my wife and I were supposed to fly to Bali, Indonesia. When we inquired with Dr.Mukta, she firmly advised us against the trip as trips can always be postponed, however, the bundle of joy arriving soon and it's happiness cannot be expressed in words! How right she was!\n\nAll through our scans, multiple pregnancy check up visits , she guided us along the correct path. There were stages where there were reasons to get tensed and scared, however, she assured us and calmed us. She gave us strict advice to avoid outside food(as much as possible) and eliminate any source that can cause problem to the  baby. We adhered to the 'T' and I guess that's what was the best for the baby and mommy!\n\nShe encouraged mommy to be as active as possible - regular walks, Pre-Natal Yoga (Squats are great) - to target a Normal Delivery. This pushed mommy(and Daddy) for regular walks! Dr Mukta also encouraged mommy (and Daddy) to actively take Lamaze classes (which tremendously helped during Mommy's active labor) . All these are indications to Dr Mukta's sustained efforts for mommy's normal delivery!\n\nCome the 'D' day where the bundle of joy wanted to come out and Dr. Mukta was right there to help mommy with the delivery! As Harshini was wheeled into the Labor ward, I wasn't allowed in( COVID restrictions). The next 45 minutes, I can be best described as a Train Wreck. I could hear Harshini pushing and pushing, and there comes our Dr Mukta - She was calm, assured and armed with the million+ deliveries'(feels like it!) experience, she brought out the angel to this world. She was also available in the Inpatient room for us as part of her rounds that she does!\n\nI would definitely advice Dr Mukta all the way from Pregnancy Check Up till Post Pregnancy! She is calm, ************** smart, experienced, firm and assuring!  ",

You are good person with lots of experience.\n\nIt was a great experience throughout the pregnancy period and also the delivery. Every visit to ma'am was a session which provided us support and confidence for the upcoming trimester.  Ma'am had a good understanding of the mother 's situation, and the advice were accordingly given. I remember me and my wife had a many queries and doubts, which ma'am had very gently handled and made us full relax and confident. She gave enough time to understand the points from both of us (me and my wife); and with a great smile she replies to the points in detail.  Even the scans and reports were very well explained by the ma'am.   \n\nI will be always be grateful to ma'am for making our life easier, during the very important phase of our life and also a special thanks for allowing me in OT   :) where I got the first glimpse of the new born. \n\nWe had reached to ma'am after doing a lot of research on internet, we took some time to decide and choose the doctor.  We are happy that our research was success and we found the safe hand with such a great experience in her field. \n\nThanks again,\n:)",

I had a tough one, but the doctor was my biggest support. Post delivery,  she reached out to me, rubbed my head and said \"you did not give up\". It felt as if someone very close was talking to me. Finally, before leaving the labour room, she appreciated each and everyone right from the nursing staff to other doctors, without taking all the credit for herself.Choosing her for my pregnancy was the best decision I made in the journey.",

She always managed to rub off her calm aura on us making us enjoy our pregnancy journey rather than stress about uncertainties.I had discussed my birth preference with her right from the start and she ensured I had a smooth vaginal delivery experience and post recovery as well.\nWhile I'm sure her experience speaks volumes of her skills as a doctor, what i loved the most about her are just the immense positive vibes i got around her. I mean, how many doctors actually make you look forward to going to the hospital??\nI'm so glad we chose her to bring our daughter into this world!\nShe has made our birthing experience extremely special and for that we are extremely grateful to her.

I saw Dr. Mukta in my 6th week of pregnancy and there on it was a very comfortable journey for me. Dr. Mukta is friendly, keeps it simple and states facts. Even though I had clot and bleed scare early on, she remained calm, got me to do the required scan and advised bed rest for two weeks. Coming to the last part of my pregnancy, even though my scan showed accelerated baby growth (baby was 3.5kgs at Birth) and Dr thought normal delivery would be challenging she fully supported my decision of trying normal birth and with God's grace, took it to the end. Her confidence and expertise was literally seen when she led the team in my labour room and helped me bring my baby boy into the earthside! Thank you Dr.Mukta will always cherish this journey with you. ",

All the credit goes to her who was very supportive and helpful from my first day visit till today post delivery.I do not have any history of blood pressure. But I faced high BP during my hospital visit whereas when monitored at home , it was normal. My doctor trusted me and gave full support throughout my pregnancy journey. Even at my labor my BP shooted up above 200/100 plus, but confidently made me deliver normally. I'm very impressed with her and also recommend to every known and unknown mothers. Even at the time of festival holiday she guided the duty doctor and came at the right time for my labor (mid night around 12). She is so much experienced that she knows when will I get the pain to deliver. There was no force to go for any c-sec or epidurals irrespective of my high BP.Last but not least, I thank Dr. Mukta for her kindness, supportiveness, and everything throughout my pregnancy. God bless her and her family with happiness. \ud83d\ude0a There are no words to appreciate and thank you. Thanks a ton from my husband and myself.\ud83d\ude4f Hope to see you soon for our second child in upcoming years. \ud83d\ude00 ",

She listened to each of my silly concerns and answered all, with patience. Took into consideration all my wants and specifics regarding delivery. Aptly anticipated needs - for me and my guest in the tummy, and timely addressed all.\n\nConservist coz she actually forbade me to travel even during my 'safe' 5th to 7th months of pregnancy due to risk of infections (at crowded places), while most other doctors do allow all sorts of travel during these months. But had to agree with her on logic - to better play it safe than regret. And some of her advice sounded similar to that of elders at home - eg: eating less cashews during pregnancy, etc.\n\n\nOverall, her unique blend worked really well for me and I would highly recommend her if you should need a G&O around Malleshwaram.!! :)",

We had lots of doubt and curiosity about pregnancy .Her positivity, explanation of the issue and how to overcome it without scaring made us very comfortable with her. \nHer guidance and support  throughout pregnancy period was amazing and her advise motivates to us to connect with our baby during pregnancy and post the period. The bonding between her and my wife helps to  boost the confident in my wife.She gave her all the confident and created positivity around her.We never hesitated in asking anything which was on  mind till the end of pregnancy such was the level of comfort she created around her. No matter what time of the day or night it was, she was always available to guide me on slightest of my doubts and problems. Thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts for taking such good care of us during/after the pregnancy as well as the delivery!! Because of your professionalism and warm smiles, we felt like we were in safe hands and that gave us peace of mind towards the big day. Thank you for helping us deliver the most precious gift of our life .We cannot put into words our gratitude for everything you have done for new our family!\u201d",

She was so humble and approachable, cleared all my apprehensions and queries so patiently. The best part is she remembers the history of the case and gives the best treatment. She examines very carefully and explains the medical conditions and their aids in the most comfortable manner. Her advice and medication has been extremely beneficial throughout the period. She is an expert in her field, very confident but very down to earth. She hears your concern ( personal too ), asks how u feel and tries to make the journey as amicable as possible. Explains each and every step throughout the pregnancy from a test to tablet that's prescribed. She talks to you before the procedure, during and after as well in such a sweet manner. She was so understanding and always added a personal touch to everything. We traveled from a distance to consult her  she used to keep all the tests, consultation and any such to one single date a month to limit the frequent visits. She was present through my long labour and delivery. This platform falls short of praising her rather \u2018thank you\u2019 seems so trivial. Any words of appreciation will be less for the kind of advice, strength and support that she has provided us in all these months. We truly enjoyed our pregnancy journey with her and were blessed with a healthy baby girl on May 15th.Thank you once again ma'am and we highly recommend her for all the future parents to be. She's a gem. ",

In the last trimester due to genetics when i was diagnosed with gestational diabetes..she did not scare me or did not even try to scare me but guided me further well with which i was able to deliver vaginally without epidural (again she did not force me and left the decision on me)..also when my placenta did not deliver naturally she was quick enough to manually deliver it in time...overall she was the main reason for us to select the hospital altogether and v were more than happy with her..i guess this is what is called as experience speaks... Finally this was my story where she helped me deliver vaginally though i had gestational diabetes, hypothyroidism and my baby weighed 3.44kg at birth.. kudos to all the positive energy she fills in which inturn helps u gain confidence n trust on ur own body... She always said me that all these GDM, thyroid etc is not a factor to not have normal delivery as long as we follow a healthy lifestyle and she proved it.. also not to forget even in the labour room she made sure i was hydrated and had the energy to push and also followed up with my baby's pediatrician once he was born too..\nThanks a ton again doctor...infact now that the consultations have ended we really miss the consultations which always gave us those positive vibes..you are truly an inspiration!!\n\nBrownie points: her calculations are so apt that my baby weighed almost the same kgs that she had said us.. also her guidance on exercises helped me dilate faster..\nShe was there in the labour room even before the duty doctor called her to inform the status and at the right time(though it was late night)(she knew by when i would be dilated enough to deliver too) <3",

My wife (Harshini) was apprehensive,excited, nervous, scared, jittery and tensed;  she was basically in unknown territory! \n\nAppointment taken and we were waiting! Those few minutes felt like forever!! Dr.Mukta welcomed us into the room and she spoke to us just like a friend. She comforted us and asked us the routine questions; she advised us to go for a pregnancy test. The following weekend, my wife and I were supposed to fly to Bali, Indonesia. When we inquired with Dr.Mukta, she firmly advised us against the trip as trips can always be postponed, however, the bundle of joy arriving soon and it's happiness cannot be expressed in words! How right she was!\n\nAll through our scans, multiple pregnancy check up visits , she guided us along the correct path. There were stages where there were reasons to get tensed and scared, however, she assured us and calmed us. She gave us strict advice to avoid outside food(as much as possible) and eliminate any source that can cause problem to the  baby. We adhered to the 'T' and I guess that's what was the best for the baby and mommy!\n\nShe encouraged mommy to be as active as possible - regular walks, Pre-Natal Yoga (Squats are great) - to target a Normal Delivery. This pushed mommy(and Daddy) for regular walks! Dr Mukta also encouraged mommy (and Daddy) to actively take Lamaze classes (which tremendously helped during Mommy's active labor) . All these are indications to Dr Mukta's sustained efforts for mommy's normal delivery!\n\nCome the 'D' day where the bundle of joy wanted to come out and Dr. Mukta was right there to help mommy with the delivery! As Harshini was wheeled into the Labor ward, I wasn't allowed in( COVID restrictions). The next 45 minutes, I can be best described as a Train Wreck. I could hear Harshini pushing and pushing, and there comes our Dr Mukta - She was calm, assured and armed with the million+ deliveries'(feels like it!) experience, she brought out the angel to this world. She was also available in the Inpatient room for us as part of her rounds that she does!\n\nI would definitely advice Dr Mukta all the way from Pregnancy Check Up till Post Pregnancy! She is calm, ************** smart, experienced, firm and assuring!  ",

You are good person with lots of experience.\n\nIt was a great experience throughout the pregnancy period and also the delivery. Every visit to ma'am was a session which provided us support and confidence for the upcoming trimester.  Ma'am had a good understanding of the mother 's situation, and the advice were accordingly given. I remember me and my wife had a many queries and doubts, which ma'am had very gently handled and made us full relax and confident. She gave enough time to understand the points from both of us (me and my wife); and with a great smile she replies to the points in detail.  Even the scans and reports were very well explained by the ma'am.   \n\nI will be always be grateful to ma'am for making our life easier, during the very important phase of our life and also a special thanks for allowing me in OT   :) where I got the first glimpse of the new born. \n\nWe had reached to ma'am after doing a lot of research on internet, we took some time to decide and choose the doctor.  We are happy that our research was success and we found the safe hand with such a great experience in her field. \n\nThanks again,\n:)",

I had a tough one, but the doctor was my biggest support. Post delivery,  she reached out to me, rubbed my head and said \"you did not give up\". It felt as if someone very close was talking to me. Finally, before leaving the labour room, she appreciated each and everyone right from the nursing staff to other doctors, without taking all the credit for herself.Choosing her for my pregnancy was the best decision I made in the journey.",

She always managed to rub off her calm aura on us making us enjoy our pregnancy journey rather than stress about uncertainties.I had discussed my birth preference with her right from the start and she ensured I had a smooth vaginal delivery experience and post recovery as well.\nWhile I'm sure her experience speaks volumes of her skills as a doctor, what i loved the most about her are just the immense positive vibes i got around her. I mean, how many doctors actually make you look forward to going to the hospital??\nI'm so glad we chose her to bring our daughter into this world!\nShe has made our birthing experience extremely special and for that we are extremely grateful to her.

I saw Dr. Mukta in my 6th week of pregnancy and there on it was a very comfortable journey for me. Dr. Mukta is friendly, keeps it simple and states facts. Even though I had clot and bleed scare early on, she remained calm, got me to do the required scan and advised bed rest for two weeks. Coming to the last part of my pregnancy, even though my scan showed accelerated baby growth (baby was 3.5kgs at Birth) and Dr thought normal delivery would be challenging she fully supported my decision of trying normal birth and with God's grace, took it to the end. Her confidence and expertise was literally seen when she led the team in my labour room and helped me bring my baby boy into the earthside! Thank you Dr.Mukta will always cherish this journey with you. ",

All the credit goes to her who was very supportive and helpful from my first day visit till today post delivery.I do not have any history of blood pressure. But I faced high BP during my hospital visit whereas when monitored at home , it was normal. My doctor trusted me and gave full support throughout my pregnancy journey. Even at my labor my BP shooted up above 200/100 plus, but confidently made me deliver normally. I'm very impressed with her and also recommend to every known and unknown mothers. Even at the time of festival holiday she guided the duty doctor and came at the right time for my labor (mid night around 12). She is so much experienced that she knows when will I get the pain to deliver. There was no force to go for any c-sec or epidurals irrespective of my high BP.Last but not least, I thank Dr. Mukta for her kindness, supportiveness, and everything throughout my pregnancy. God bless her and her family with happiness. \ud83d\ude0a There are no words to appreciate and thank you. Thanks a ton from my husband and myself.\ud83d\ude4f Hope to see you soon for our second child in upcoming years. \ud83d\ude00 ",

She listened to each of my silly concerns and answered all, with patience. Took into consideration all my wants and specifics regarding delivery. Aptly anticipated needs - for me and my guest in the tummy, and timely addressed all.\n\nConservist coz she actually forbade me to travel even during my 'safe' 5th to 7th months of pregnancy due to risk of infections (at crowded places), while most other doctors do allow all sorts of travel during these months. But had to agree with her on logic - to better play it safe than regret. And some of her advice sounded similar to that of elders at home - eg: eating less cashews during pregnancy, etc.\n\n\nOverall, her unique blend worked really well for me and I would highly recommend her if you should need a G&O around Malleshwaram.!! :)",

She is a very friendly person, equally professional, she talks to the point, gives her patient enough confidence and supports them throughout.I had a miscarriage before and told her about it, she gave me complete confidence  saying that this baby is her responsibility. She never suggests unnecessary tests or scans until it is really necessary. At times others might feel that she is rushing, but she makes sure she has complete track of her patients.She always encouraged me for normal delivery. I waited almost till my due date but no signs of labor hence she took a call to induce labor and asked me to get admitted. One entire day she induced pain, but there was no signs of it. Doctor at the same time waited patiently for one whole day keeping  complete track of my progress thru her staffs though she was not around which gave me more confidence that I was at best and safe hands! She din't panic me at any stage, continued to support me for normal delivery. After one entire day, I delivered a cute and healthy baby girl.I still believe, if it was not Dr. Mukta I would have ended up with C section.Completely happy with her. I have already suggested Dr. Mukta to many of my friends and would continue to suggest to many.Thanks a lot Doctor \ud83d\ude0a",

It was a precious pregnancy as I had a history of recurrent miscarriages and was NK cell deficient. I was in a really bad need of a good gynecologist, who would understand my problem. I came across Dr.Mukta from all these great reviews about her on practo. When I first visited her she read all my reports with patience and reassured me that this time everything's going to be fine. I started consulting her and things went on really smooth. (I was put on LMWH injections and ecosprin.) In every appointment doctor would go through even the smallest detail in my reports and would take timely, precise decisions. She never prescribes unnecessary tests or medications. Her treatment is always on point. I would definitely recommend her to everyone. \nIn my third trimester I was low on Hemoglobin,so doctor suggested me a Iron injection which is given through IV. I was really scared to get that injection and I still remember  she went to the nurse personally and advised her to be gentle with me as i was scared. She also came twice to check on me. who does that? I mean which doctor takes so much care of a patient. This act of her really touched my heart. Lucky me...! \nAlso Due to my past history of miscarriages I used to overthink a lot and would ask so many questions but doctor was always ready to answer even my silliest question. She always welcomed me with a smile and throughout my pregnancy she boosted me with confidence. During my labour she came to hospital at midnight in no time for which I am really greatful to her. I can actually go on and on and would still not stop praising her. She's one of a kind. Thank you so much Dr.Mukta. You actually have no idea how much of joy and happiness you have bought into our lives. You are truly a gem\u263a\ufe0f ",

She is always cautious and makes sure she follows up on any thing that might even be slightly out of ordinary. Talking to her, you get the feeling that you are in good hands. \n\nFor me one of the things that reassured me at every visit was that she used to check the fetal  development using the scan machine. With this we had the confidence that things are going smooth without having to wait for the major scans. \n\nShe encouraged us for normal delivery, though we were open to all suggestions. When my due date was approaching but the baby didn't drop and I had no signs of going into labour any time soon, she suggested induction. I wasnt 100% sure as I didn't know my pain tolerance and if I would be able to do it. However she gave me the confidence that we can definitely give it a try and if things don't progress as expected, then we can always evaluate our options at that point. That helped me really relax and  not feel guilty (I was caught between wanting a natural delivery yet not sure if I can go through the ordeal). \nAs my baby didn't move down and the NST wasn't great after my water broke, she suggested C-section which went very smooth even though it was unplanned. \n\nShe doesn't try to mollycoddle us and is quite transparent in her communication. She kept telling me to walk a lot and exercise regularly. She encouraged me to go to office as long as I was feeling good. However she would ask me to be careful, especially towards the end and not take risk as my office and hospital were quite far from one another.\n\nOverall, I would definitely want to go to the same doctor next time.\n\n",

While I delivered a baby there were few complications which cud ve turned to c section, but my doc made sure that she handle situation very well encouraged me through out the process, pushed me to do it. In such situations all u want to see a friendly face and she was absolutely that person. I delivered a lovely baby boy of 3.4 kg (normal/vaccum delivery). She as my doctor did a great job. I am now 4 months postportum at perfect health. \nThank you dr mukta for being part of my pregnancy journey. ",

Post C-Section recovery was quick and after a month now, I'm perfectly fine and healthy.Sincere thanks to Dr. Mukta Nadig ,Dr Prakash Desai and all departments from Cloudnine, Malleshwaram for the wonderful support during the pregnancy period.Thank you!",

From the day one she guided us like a mother telling what to do and what not to do. She is very dynamic and straight forward person, who tells the fact directly and cleared all the doubts what we ask. Even though I was obese she filled confident and helped me to maintain the weight during pregnancy. She also preferred Normal vaginal delivery which I thought I can never go for. Even at the time of delivery her words filled confidence to deliver successfully. With her guidance and support we are blessed with baby boy. We are very thankful to ma'am. After deliver she even followed up with pediatrician about the baby's condition. And she is guiding us post deliver also. Thing we liked is ma'am won't suggest for unnecessary visits and checkups , she is very confident with what she suggests. We truly recommend ma'am for all .Thank you once again ma'am. ",

I had a very easy C- section, also recovered quickly.  Even after my surgery she gave me tips on how to stay fit. She is approachable and also available on phone for any urgent queries throughout my pregnancy and after my delivery.She handled my pregnancy and delivery with a great ease. She's truly an angel, no exaggerations.I feel lucky to have her as my doctor. We are blessed with a baby girl. Thank you for all your support and help ma'am.Best Regards ",

Two abortions in 12 years and getting pregnant again at the age of 37 made me skeptical about every thing about pregnancy. It was Mukta mams calmness and experience that made me feel comfortable. She answered all my questions patiently and guided me through my pregnancy. I was having bleeding during 4th month of pregnancy but all the reports were fine. It was her experience that came into help where she removed a small cyst that was causing the bleeding. She did not leave any stone unturned to make sure that my baby did not have any complications. I am blessed with a baby girl on August 2nd and will be forever indebted to Dr. Mukta.  Thankyou verymuch mam for your kind attention and treatment.",

Something i really wanted to highlight about her is - she is very genuine, very friendly , she will never suggest you something which is unnecessary, her way of treating her patients is really awesome. She always  makes sure that all the doubt's of her patients are clear. I am very glad that did my motherhood journey under her guidance n delivered a baby boy. One more important thing is her moral support which she provided me during my journey was really appreciable.Me and my hubby really want to thank her from bottom of  our heart for all her support n guidance throughout. If you are planning for a delivery in Cloud nine Malleshwaram, we highly recommend you to approach Dr.Mukta Nadig.",

Her guidance was with us like morning star through out from conceiving to delivery.We found Dr Mukta very calm ,confident through out and I have witnessed her calmness and professionalism even inside labor room.It was normal delivery ,as usual timing was odd but still Dr Mukta made herself available at the time of delivery and completed everything smoothly .Would like to thank her once again. ** ** *******  *** ** *** ** *** **** ************* ********* ** ********* ******",

During all our visits, she was very approachable and calm in explaining things to us in detail. We had complications during the pregnancy but Dr. Mukta helped us understand the issue with ease and excellent guidance. The way she explained things were in detail which were more practical in nature. I had a smooth normal delivery and Dr. Mukta calmly helped me through the delivery process. Despite her busy schedule and other appointments on the day of my delivery, she was with me and I was assured by her that I could do this and everything would go well.

She has also suggested some top notch tests so that we can be safe that sorry - which I appreciate a lot.Must say, I admire her professionalism, expertise, experience and knowledge. Name your issue, she treats and explains it in such a way that it gives you so much emotional strength. Dr. Nadig is also very much patient friendly. She has started video consultation even on Sundays after once I was unable to get in touch with her on a Sunday with some health issue. She has supported me with my vaginal delivery and she even came down to the hospital when I was in labor in the midnight and handled it all with so much ease. Thank you Dr. Nadig, you are amazing! \ud83d\ude42",

She\u2019s very confident in her expertise and speciality; caring and very tolerant. Many instances I would lose patience and have hormonal mood swings (she probably saw not the best of me) and tolerated the same affectionately (so I felt)! Thank you Doc for coming into my life \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAbout Columbia Asia hospital, though I have a different story to tell, maybe some other time, elsewhere. \n\nThis token of gratitude from me is only for Dr Mukta Nadig, my angel \ud83d\ude07! She deserves much more than this honestly \u2764\ufe0f",

She also took all the necessary precautions like checking if there were internal scars and weight of the baby before we plan for the delivery method, which gave us confidence.\n\nOn the day of the delivery Dr Mukta came to the delivery room on time  and was so friendly all along and made the delivery seem very easy and fast.\nI also liked the hospital(Cloudnine) facilities which made feel very comfortable and made the post delivery recovery so easy.",

One of our relative suggested her and we dint repent for choosing this doctor. The delivery went smooth as expected. \n\nShe showed  patience to answer  all  pregnancy related questions.  sometimes my wife used to overshoot questions  to clear her doubts which she had in her mind. she was able to answer and clear all our doubts most of the times. \n\nOurs was a planned c-section at the mid of 39 weeks. My wife was interested in a normal delivery. But when the internal tests were done at 39 weeks,Doctor said us that baby head was not fixed.And there was no signs of labor pain for my wife. Doctor hinted us Cesarean  would be ideal  though she never told us directly. She gave both the options to us (Inducing pain/Cesarean). Me and my wife  practically assessed the conditions what doctor said from reports  and decided to opt for c-section which we felt was a good decision at the end. \n\nOverall a good professional doctor. I would recommend her. ",

Throughout the pregnancy journey she guided me well on my diet and never allowed me to put-on extra weight, this helped in Zero complexities. \n\nShe stood with me like a ROCK and made sure my baby gained good weight before she came out. The best part is she never prescribe tests or medications unnecessarily. \n\n I never thought I would have a vaginal delivery but she made it possible, On April 21st \u00a0My little princes was born!! \n\nI pretty much hope she still remembers my labour room Drama!!\n\nAll Thanks to Dr. Mukta Mam she is definitely an Angel for every women in cloudnine.",

Initially we were worried due to Twins, typically moderate/high risk scenario, but we got utmost care and support and Dr is very much friendly. Always she prescribed precautionary steps whenever vitals are slightly around border, this avoided any risk. And finally got delivered with twins without any complications and excellent support from Dr and hospital team. Thank you very much for all the great support and personal care.Doctor's availability & approachable is another highlight, she is available in both Sahakarnagar & Malleswaram branches on all six days,  over Video call also when can't travel, even on Sunday evenings. In most visits we were able combine scans and Dr consultations perfectly.This boosts confidence and peace of mind to take care better. She never compromises on quality and ensures Hospital staff takes care and fully compliance to standards.",

So when YOU decide to go with Induced or normal (V) delivery, you know the risks.\n\n",

Also for everyone curious I opted for a C Sec and it was the right thing as the umbilical cord was wrapped twice around my lil one. By God's grace and doctor's help my recovery was super quick with no complications. I would encourage folks looking out with doubts that you won't go wrong consulting with her. Her concern for you doesn't just end at the delivery room. She helps out with the postpartum stuff and more. Thank you Doctor! Glad we got to do this together\u2764\ufe0f",

However as I was mentally not prepared she let me have the mental strength, comfort, explained everything and get back to her. I had finally chosen Feb 22 to get admitted and my baby was born on Feb 23, by normal delivery at 3.50am. Dr.Mukta was available for me even at 3am, which is something that comforts the patient.
