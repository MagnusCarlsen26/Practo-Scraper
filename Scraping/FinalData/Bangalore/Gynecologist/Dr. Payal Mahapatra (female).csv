After listening to her case history, doctor asked her to get some tests done in her clinic. After getting the test reports, she suggested some follow up tests including biopsies; this went on for a couple of times and everytime the test procedure became more and more painful for her. A week after when we visited her for consultation on the previous test reports, she mentioned that she has no access to those reports(even when all the test were done in her clinic) and asked me to show those reports in my phone. She even tried to pressurize her to repeat the same test with anaesthesia done as the last sample was not adequate. Besides, she shouted on both of us for not taking the medicines (including antibiotic and painkillers) she prescribed earlier even after we repeatedly told her that we prefer not to take any medicine unless it's urgent and my mom experienced side-effects from those medicines earlier. To our surprise, her assistant asked us to pay consultation fee (600 Rs) as soon as we left doctor's room even when it was clearly mentioned by the same  person on the previous day that the doctor doesn't change anything for checking reports if we visit her in person within 7 days.
