While I had lost all hopes of having a baby after two consecutive pregnancy loss, It was Dr. Chitra who gave me confidence that I can have a successful pregnancy and a healthy baby. Recently I gave birth to a baby boy.  Pregnancy was filled with complications plus GDM, while we were under tremendous stress, doctor stood by us and gave us hopes that everything will be fine. Delivered a preterm baby at 36 weeks, doctor took very good care of me, she has a personal touch to every patient. Cannot thank her enough, blessed to have consulted her. ",

Having delivery during this covid pandemic is really very challenging but the way she boost up and keep answering to our concerns over face to face consultation, telephonic call, email are really remarkable. I never felt hegitated to consult her for any kind of queries. In between of our pregnancy, unfortunately my wife got dengue as well but the way she supported us and ensure that the recovery should be faster with right set of treatment is very effective and I really obliged her for the same. Thanks mam for helping us out during entire pregnancy cycle and even after that. There are so many things to mentioned, really appreciated. ",

She never prescribed unnecessary  medicines and tests for me also she explained why a particular medicine is prescribed.  Though I stay far away from SAKRA,  I consulted Dr Chitra through out my pregnancy and delivery since I liked and trusted her. I highly recommend Dr Chitra for her experience,  ********* and the way she handles patients. ",

She understands every patient and their anxiety, she is very calm and spends time in counselling and answering every doubt we have. Available on phone and email for urgent queries. Consulted Dr.Chitra for my second pregnancy, had lost first baby at 7th month in my first pregnancy. Unfortunately had a miscarriage in my second pregnancy. While I had lost all hopes of having a baby after two consecutive pregnancy loss, It was Dr. Chitra who gave me confidence that I can have a successful pregnancy and a healthy baby. Recently I gave birth to a baby boy.  Pregnancy was filled with complications plus GDM, while we were under tremendous stress, doctor stood by us and gave us hopes that everything will be fine. Delivered a preterm baby at 36 weeks, doctor took very good care of me, she has a personal touch to every patient. Cannot thank her enough, blessed to have consulted her. ",

Having delivery during this covid pandemic is really very challenging but the way she boost up and keep answering to our concerns over face to face consultation, telephonic call, email are really remarkable. I never felt hegitated to consult her for any kind of queries. In between of our pregnancy, unfortunately my wife got dengue as well but the way she supported us and ensure that the recovery should be faster with right set of treatment is very effective and I really obliged her for the same. Thanks mam for helping us out during entire pregnancy cycle and even after that. There are so many things to mentioned, really appreciated. ",
