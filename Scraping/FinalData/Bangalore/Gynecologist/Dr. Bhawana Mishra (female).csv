"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",,0,0,YES,"After consulting a number of ob- gyns and just not finding the right one , my husband and I did a thorough search and chanced upon Dr Bhawana Mishra . Reading the glowing reviews gave us hope that this Dr could just be the one. From the get go Dr Bhawana was like a breath of fresh air , with her calm demeanor and beaming smile . I felt comfortable and confident in her  . She calmed my fears , addressed all my concerns and cleared my doubts without rushing through the appointment . My pregnancy was anything but painless  , I had different symptoms almost every week and Dr Bhawana treated me with utmost patience and care . Whenever I had any uncomfortable symptoms I would msg her and she would reply in a jiffy. Her medicines would always work like magic for me and she made my pregnancy journey as comfortable as possible . During my delivery she came back from her vacation and performed my C section . Seeing her at the operation theatre I knew I was in good hands and my C section couldn't have gone smoother , it was over before I even knew it . I've never met a doctor who is a perfect combination of patient and professional with a  profound love for her patients.
