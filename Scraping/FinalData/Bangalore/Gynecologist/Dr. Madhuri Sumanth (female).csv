"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD),",0,0,YES,I am writing this review after 6 months. As it was my first pregnancy I was looking for good doctor who can do normal vaginal delivery. I was already consulting one Dr. near my house and was not much satisfied as there was no friendly interaction between patient and Dr. So my husband got suggestion from his friend about Dr. Madhuri. Initially I was worried to change Dr in 8th month but when i visited her for first time Dr. Madhuri made me comfortable and promised me that she will do normal delivery. As promised she helped me deliver healthy baby boy. I personally recommend her to all my family and friends. Thank you Dr for your support.,2022-10-04 10:40:55,False,True,Nalini,,,
