Sapna mam treated my wife with such care and kept us honest on all stages of the pregnancy, and adequately provided us the right support and guidance. One such example is, my wife had pre-term delivery symptoms at 26 weeks, but mam helped us with assuring words and treatments and my wife was successfully able to deliver a healthy baby in term. There were many more complications we encountered during the pregnancy but Sapna mam guided us through all those and ensured we see the happiest day of our lives.

Considering the fact the situation of my wife was a very critical one and she was facing a rare complication, Dr Sapna has always been there for us giving the much needed moral and emotional support and guiding us through the right direction to proceed with at every stage of the pregnancy. The doctor did understand her situation helped us in every way she could during my wife's critical months and helped us in all ways namingly , attending us with priority for regular check-up as sitting for long was not good for my wife's health , advising the right time to get hospitalized whenever there could be a risk of some mishappeninng , how these  additional expenses due to the critical situation can be as less as possible with no compromise on health related required treatments etc etc

We had an idea that there could be serious complications in the process but she managed the operation very well and things are under control now. She has been a saviour and  her skills, extra care , dedication and regular support has helped her get off from a life and risk situation and finally we blessed with baby boy.

Once again lots of thanks to her and I would sat that its will be sincere recommendation to others to consult Dr. Sapna atleast once and she will ensure you will have a smiling face at the end.

Usually hospital and Sr. Doctor little hesitate to attend CGHS patient, but Dr Sapna  being Sr Doctor, never let us feel that. For her we are a patient like all others.
On 36th weeks we had a littile complication regarding Amniotic Fluid index, it was going down side, which results less growth of baby in womb.  She admited my wife and tried to improve level, but it was further going down, ultimately decided to go for Caesarean Section. For our first baby (Caesarean Section only), cut was done vertically, causes problem during this time. Thanks to her, she did it nicely, and it's 7 days to our baby. Both baby n my wife are fine n healthy.

During our admission Dr was on line with duty doctor at night 1:30 and morning 4:30 too, it shows how much she is involved with her patient.

During OPD visit, we may wait for 15-30min mostly or some time more (if more receptionist will inform over the phone in morning itself). This wait is not because she is late, actually in between she will go to OT and runningly come back.

Our babies were delivered safely and are doing fine.Would like to reiterate what many others have said earlier - Dr Sapna Ma’am is gem of a doctor, a through professional with a assuring smile and genuine care for patients.Would like to highlight two things that, we believe, deserve special mention. First, high standards that she has set for her entire team, not only at Sapna Health Care but also at extended hospitals. Second, despite her busy schedule, she is available at any time. In case of emergency, she told us to call her immediately irrespective of the hour and also gave us the back-up mobile numbers. At one point when we were going through a critical phase, she called us late in the evening around 11:30 pm and again next morning around 8:00 am to check the things.

I called her and she asked me to message her incase of anything.

She has her own clinic or hospital now, I understand doctors are all busy and overworked during Covid but please don't respond if you are not free or in a good mood. But don't respond and block a person who is seeking help from you. If practo wants to check the facts, I have the screenshot where she has blocked my number. Though she was very strict or whatever, I wanted her to be my gynaec for my second baby too because of my own sentiments. But this is not how you treat a person who is anxious to get some clarification from you.  Please please please don't do that to a pregnant woman or woman who are trying to conceive.

This was our first pregnancy and everything was new. There were multiple complications we faced from 4th to 6th month and Dr advice has helped gain our baby girl’s weight through this time. We anticipated a premature birth and it happened so by 6.5 weeks early. We as parents to be were obviously worried and Dr did the best to push through to 34th week from 30th even with complications. Our baby is a week old now and yes, she need more care through the first 5-8 weeks, but she is safe.

Dr was available at almost all times when we reached out to her, unless she had any prior appointments. One thing I/we learnt through the pregnancy is, every small thing matter to us and we try to get double checked if all is well with doctor. That’s quite normal and human tendency. At the same time, if Dr is unavailable, we should also understand, there is someone else she is attending to, who need urgent attention.

She tried to push for a normal delivery all through, but, she transparently conveyed when it could possibly endanger the delivery process and we had to chose otherwise.
