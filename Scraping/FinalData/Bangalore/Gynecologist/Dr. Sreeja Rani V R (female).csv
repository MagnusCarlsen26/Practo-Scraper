Although I had no prior personal experience with her, I decided to consult Dr. Sreeja based on the positive online reviews and informative YouTube videos she had posted. 

From the moment I spoke with Dr. Sreeja, my skepticism began to fade away. She immediately put me at ease and instilled confidence that I was in safe hands. My delivery was in the early morning hours, and I was impressed to see that Dr. Sreeja was there with me even during off-hours alongside her team, ensuring that every aspect of the delivery went smoothly.

She never recommended any unnecessary tests, scans, or medications. Additionally, she was open to considering our opinions and preferences, which made the entire process more comfortable and personalized.

Based on my personal experience, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Sreeja Rani to anyone in need of a skilled and compassionate gynecologist.
