My Wife, she had 3 back-back miscarriages in the past and when we consulted her, she has given us a hope by identifying the problem partially at least where in others were unable to find the same. There were series of tests she had performed during the investigation, was able to explain why she did all these tests that are to narrow down the issue. There were situations both myself and my wife were feeling very nervous and worried by thinking of past situations but she filled in confidence for both of us with her words. Our treatment is still on-going, and we are yet to see the results from her treatment. It's too early to judge her treatment but we are pleased with the experience that we had till today. On top of everything, we trust her and that is the most important drug of all as you need to put some trust when doctor is trying to diagnose your problem so it will boost her confidence aswell to focus *** *********** *********  As said, we believe in her and hoping she can do something this time if my wife conceives again.\n\nThank You, Anitha garu *** **** ********* ******** *** ********** I appreciate your special focus and interest on our case.\n\nMany Thanks,\nBhargava Ponnuru\nMahalakshmi Swetha",

She is least bothered about the issues you are facing and she will tell everything is fine. According to her everything was fine and when we went there for the seven month pregnancy growth scan of the baby to Dr. Smitha, then she told that the baby's growth is not good and in Doppler scan it came out that there is a backward blood flow in placenta. It was an emergency case and she asked to visit Dr. Anitha BR. But even in the case of emergency, she delayed the visit for hours and was keep on asking nurses but they would go to doctor and tell me that you are the next person to be in, but it took hours ** *** *** **** **** *** ********* ****** *** **** ***** ** ******* *** *********** ***** ******** *** when I threatened them that give my reports I will visit another hospital, then she finally met us and considering emergency case as baby's heart kept on dropping,  they took my wife for emergency care to have cesarean and deliver a baby in seven months and that also after waiting for 5 hours finally they did cealsarean and my baby was taken out and with ventilation support, he was taken to their branch in Indira Nagar Motherhood hospital. In Whitefield Motherhood hospital, they said that the weight of the baby was 650 grams but in Indira Nagar branch. they said he is 800 grams and also the baby had infection and very low platelet count. My baby was there in neonatal ICU for seven days and finally he succumbed to the disease. I was speechless and the main concern was when the same doctor said in the six month pregnancy check up, that everything was fine, how come this happened. *** **** *** *** ****** ** *** *** **** ******** ********** ********** **** *** ******* ** * ****** They don't have any desire to serve the people.

Later a nurse checked my BP and weight and send me and my husband to her cabin. Her assistant was working on her computer and we were asked to wait until doctor comes. After some time her assistant started asking questions without even introducing herself. *** * **** **** *********** **** *** ********* **** *** ******* When the doctor came she didnt even wished and didn't even bothered to ask however she asked her assistant and after knowing she just did some checkup. Her way of communication was very rough/rude and not convincing at all. I believe as a doctor her words should do more wonders than her treatment. Although she said nothing to worry as its normal to have spotting during ovulation. But as a doctor she should be more professional in speaking. Talking in Hindi is good but there is always a way to communicate and pass the message. If a doctor sounds rude the patient will be more tensed and worried. She in my case didnt even bothered to ask or give more information. When we even said that we are planning to have our child and asked what measurements need to take since I am also Type 2 diabetic, her response was very cold. No much information she gave infact she didnt speak at all. Felt like she was too busy with her other patients and didn't bother to diagnose us. Even though the issue was normal but as a layman its a concern to us wherein we dont know any medical terms n condition and hence we visit to a Doctor! Felt very nagative for her.",

Instead of the average reviews, I thought to give it a try as femiint health is very close to my place. So I met her in April 2017 and on the 1st meeting we decided that we must give it a shot. We were very much impressed by the way she understood our problem and came up with immediate solution.  Since April I have been visiting her and getting my treatment done. Please do not go with the reviews on the net for the doctor as she is not only an amazing doctor but also an amazing person. Yes u might have little issues like waiting period is too long at times and the staff is not that efficient compared to other hospitals but when the doctor is so good and well spoken then I guess we ought to ignore the other stuff.

My Wife, she had 3 back-back miscarriages in the past and when we consulted her, she has given us a hope by identifying the problem partially at least where in others were unable to find the same. There were series of tests she had performed during the investigation, was able to explain why she did all these tests that are to narrow down the issue. There were situations both myself and my wife were feeling very nervous and worried by thinking of past situations but she filled in confidence for both of us with her words. Our treatment is still on-going, and we are yet to see the results from her treatment. It's too early to judge her treatment but we are pleased with the experience that we had till today. On top of everything, we trust her and that is the most important drug of all as you need to put some trust when doctor is trying to diagnose your problem so it will boost her confidence aswell to focus *** *********** *********  As said, we believe in her and hoping she can do something this time if my wife conceives again.\n\nThank You, Anitha garu *** **** ********* ******** *** ********** I appreciate your special focus and interest on our case.\n\nMany Thanks,\nBhargava Ponnuru\nMahalakshmi Swetha",

She is least bothered about the issues you are facing and she will tell everything is fine. According to her everything was fine and when we went there for the seven month pregnancy growth scan of the baby to Dr. Smitha, then she told that the baby's growth is not good and in Doppler scan it came out that there is a backward blood flow in placenta. It was an emergency case and she asked to visit Dr. Anitha BR. But even in the case of emergency, she delayed the visit for hours and was keep on asking nurses but they would go to doctor and tell me that you are the next person to be in, but it took hours ** *** *** **** **** *** ********* ****** *** **** ***** ** ******* *** *********** ***** ******** *** when I threatened them that give my reports I will visit another hospital, then she finally met us and considering emergency case as baby's heart kept on dropping,  they took my wife for emergency care to have cesarean and deliver a baby in seven months and that also after waiting for 5 hours finally they did cealsarean and my baby was taken out and with ventilation support, he was taken to their branch in Indira Nagar Motherhood hospital. In Whitefield Motherhood hospital, they said that the weight of the baby was 650 grams but in Indira Nagar branch. they said he is 800 grams and also the baby had infection and very low platelet count. My baby was there in neonatal ICU for seven days and finally he succumbed to the disease. I was speechless and the main concern was when the same doctor said in the six month pregnancy check up, that everything was fine, how come this happened. *** **** *** *** ****** ** *** *** **** ******** ********** ********** **** *** ******* ** * ****** They don't have any desire to serve the people.

Later a nurse checked my BP and weight and send me and my husband to her cabin. Her assistant was working on her computer and we were asked to wait until doctor comes. After some time her assistant started asking questions without even introducing herself. *** * **** **** *********** **** *** ********* **** *** ******* When the doctor came she didnt even wished and didn't even bothered to ask however she asked her assistant and after knowing she just did some checkup. Her way of communication was very rough/rude and not convincing at all. I believe as a doctor her words should do more wonders than her treatment. Although she said nothing to worry as its normal to have spotting during ovulation. But as a doctor she should be more professional in speaking. Talking in Hindi is good but there is always a way to communicate and pass the message. If a doctor sounds rude the patient will be more tensed and worried. She in my case didnt even bothered to ask or give more information. When we even said that we are planning to have our child and asked what measurements need to take since I am also Type 2 diabetic, her response was very cold. No much information she gave infact she didnt speak at all. Felt like she was too busy with her other patients and didn't bother to diagnose us. Even though the issue was normal but as a layman its a concern to us wherein we dont know any medical terms n condition and hence we visit to a Doctor! Felt very nagative for her.",

Instead of the average reviews, I thought to give it a try as femiint health is very close to my place. So I met her in April 2017 and on the 1st meeting we decided that we must give it a shot. We were very much impressed by the way she understood our problem and came up with immediate solution.  Since April I have been visiting her and getting my treatment done. Please do not go with the reviews on the net for the doctor as she is not only an amazing doctor but also an amazing person. Yes u might have little issues like waiting period is too long at times and the staff is not that efficient compared to other hospitals but when the doctor is so good and well spoken then I guess we ought to ignore the other stuff.

Dr.Anitha welcomes her patients with her big pleasant smile every single time, even if it's getting late for her to attend to her kid at home. This proves how much she is dedicated to this profession. She explains and answers all the questions that is posted to her with patience. Best part is she enjoys and feels really happy when there is a positive result and never cease to express it. I would recommend her 200%\nThank you Dr.Anitha!\nThe clinic atmosphere is really good and clean. Sometimes waiting time is more than expected, but I guess when a doctor is too good you will have to wait for her time.",

Also made sure that we build up haemoglobin so that there is no need for transfusions during operation. This goes on to show that doctor gives proper personal attention to patient. DEFINITELY  recommend her. \n\nShe is one of few doctor who clarifies all the question posed to her so you can be sure of what kind of treatment you are undergoing. She is prompt to help the patient by replying prudently any calls/message sent to her. The hospital staff is very friendly. Thanks Dr Anitha",

But it can be cured with a minor surgery. But unlike other doctors she didn\u2019t right away ask me for surgery. She asked me to wait for a month or two , since polyps get washed away in their own with the menstrual flow. I waited for 2-3 months but the problems increased. When I decided for the surgery, my kid was just 2yrs old and I didn\u2019t wanna stay away from him. Doctor took care of this concern of mine and discharged me in the evening. She is very calm and you can talk to her about every gynaec issue. I am happy to have found her !",

Despite the long line of patients outside her door, she didn't rush me.. she let me pause and take my time to process this loss.. I am grateful for her sensitivity, this is very rare in Indian medical scene. For the next pregnancy, I will go to her first! \n",

I personally feel  Dr. Anitha  is very soft spoken and also she listens to patients problem with some extra interest she has. During the tenure, most of the times I have asked many questions to her and she answered to me and satisfied us every possible way, We had a good experience with her treatment procedure and now we are blessed with a beautiful angel in our life. I feel happy !! According  to me  Femiint health is definitely a better place than all the others around Whitefield, but little expensive for middle class families like us, but that's ok, because they are very careful to their patients. Definitely recommended. ",
