"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Labor and Delivery,",0,0,YES,"Started Consulting Dr Namita Kapoor after 34 week of pregnancy due to bad experience from previous doctor. After a long search and reading lot of reviews we got some confidence to meet and discuss our next course of action. Since day one we got good confidence on her and with every visit this confidence level increased and we decided to proceed for rest of the process with Dr. Namita Kapoor (with a regret why we didn't choose her since start). 

We liked the suggestions and the process she follows for whole consulting process to keep it as Natural as possible. And even when other doctors starts scaring with few natural minor complications like in our case for 1 loop round the neck and other doctors were scaring and forcing us to plan early delivery (cesarean post 32 week or 36 week max) because of this which was not necessary. 

Dr. Namita checked all the previous scans and reports and said because of this there is no need to plan early delivery. we can still wait till last day (with monitoring baby movements at home) and still Normal delivery can be tried. In case baby do not come down and heartbeat fluctuates while trying then on last day last option will be caesarean otherwise most of the cases Normal delivery is possible. We were convinced with the way she told at least she is still trying for normal delivery and there can be chance we can have baby delivered without caesarean. 

On the Day of delivery. She tried her level best to get baby delivered normally but we can see that every time its tried the baby heartbeat was fluctuating. So considering 2 complications (loop around the neck and baby poop in womb) and heartbeat fluctuation while trying for normal delivery we have to go for emergency caesarean delivery or it will be risk to the baby that we can understand. 

Our satisfaction was like Doctor tried her level best for normal delivery that was enough for us to still keep on continuing with Dr. Namita for any of our future need. She is great doctor and this kind of attitude and skills are rare nowadays. I highly recommend Dr Namita to anyone who is really concerned about Normal and Natural process and avoid unnecessary intervention. She has great history of Normal delivery even in some complicated cases with great knowledge and skills.

Special thanks to Dr. Namita Kapoor for all the support and taking care of what is needed. I would like to thanks Columbia Asia Hospital too for the seamless process and good arrangements made during the process.

I read good reviews about Dr. Namita online and decided to see her once and then take my call. Trust me, after meeting her first time itself, my worries were all gone and I became extremely assured for my rest of the pregnancy journey, and I was right :)
Dr. Namita talks to the point and explains everything in detail. If you've done some research & know things in medical terms, then also she will be happy about it and explains rest of it, unlike other doctors who get offended  (I don't understand why). 
She takes care of the baby like her own till the end. Her positive attitude towards everything calms you down instantly. The tests and the medications are to the point. She does not suggest to go for meds unless really needed. She shares her number later in Pregnancy for the doubts or any emergency and responds via whatsapp too. In fact, post delivery too.

I was so relaxed throughout my pregnancy as I knew I was in safest hands. I could focus on my diet, exercises and baby:) And my baby was delivered Vaginally.
