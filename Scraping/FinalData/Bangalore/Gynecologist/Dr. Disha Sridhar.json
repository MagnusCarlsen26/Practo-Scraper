                "review_text": "Hi ladies, \r\nI have severe PCOS & I still got Pregnant Naturally.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m very happy to post a positive review for Dr. Disha Sridhar who helped me to conceive naturally despite all my problems.\r\n\r\nI was hopelessly walking in tears & pain after a miscarriage, then D&C and suffering from worsened PCOS (irregular periods & severe bleeding problem), cysts, fibroids in uterus & fibrodema for last 10yrs\u2026and from there to normal pregnancy, isn\u2019t that miraculous!\r\n\r\nGetting pregnant! Ah, that was a farfetched or next to impossible dream; I just anyhow wanted to have normal regular periods at that time.\r\n\r\nI had enough of birth control pills, its side effects and medication that just pumped hormones.\r\n\r\nAfter trying our luck through even ayurvedic medicine which did not yield much result; we met Dr. Disha Sridhar at Motherhood Hospital, Indiranagar, Bangalore; a very practical doctor & an integrative practitioner who believes in treating problems from its root cause through holistic healing. Her main aim is to treat patients with hormonal imbalances naturally.\r\n\r\nShe was the only doctor who gave positive nod about solving my problems from its core, talked about dissolving my cysts and recovery through natural, non invasive options, no synthetic hormonal pills & balancing my hormones naturally.  I initially thought this was not possible and was sceptical about her way of treatment, wanted to stick to ayurvedic, the proven method, but something within me urged to go forward and with my husband\u2019s unconditional support, I tried it out.  I trusted her and the results are out.\r\n\r\nGradually, my periods started to come back every month without any modern medicines. I started to revive and cherish my feminine energy thus cultivating better positive relationship with my body. I've learned to make my body something I work with as opposed to work against which helped me achieve an ideal sense of health.\r\n\r\nThus, I conceived naturally within four months of embracing healing techniques formulated by Dr. Disha.\r\n\r\nWith a healthy body, I\u2019m enjoying full problem-free, easy, effortless, nurturing pregnancy \u2014 no aches, pains or other issues, creating a smooth transition into my new state of being. \r\n\r\nAll thanks to Dr. Disha Sridhar with whom I\u2019m receiving good antenatal care at Motherhood.  With her, it\u2019s like she shares equal responsibility for my maternity care, right from nutrition, supplements to lifestyle changes. She is the one with whom we can freely talk to about our hopes and fears.\r\n\r\nWith this I would invite you to think differently about PCOS. I healed my body by balancing my hormones and through the opportunity to become a mother; my body has healed my spirit. I wish & believe the same is possible for you too.\r\n-Shreya Nambiar,\r\nBangalore.\r\n",

                "review_text": "TRUHEALING PROGRAMME - A MAGICAL MANTRA!!\n \nLife is a mirror!! You would receive, what you give. Be it the bad or the best!!\n\u201cTruhealing\u201d is a program, which helped to give the best, add the essence of positivity to life and have a healthy smile on my face always.\nIn 2012, when I was reported with hypo thyroid \u2013 I had no clue that my life would turn miserable with chains of allergies. By nature, I am a very foody person and I just love to travel and explore new places. I always wish to taste the special food of the place that I visit.\nIt so happened that in 2013 when I had such trip, I developed the first allergy within no time (after I had a food in one of the very good restaurant) suddenly rushed to the doctor and took medicine. To my surprise, even the medicine turned allergic to me. Then I started to hunt for a good treatment to overcome this allergy. Initially all the doctors noted this to be the food allergy. I underwent a food allergy test too. Nothing worked!!! As all the tests resulted as normal.\nMeanwhile the hypothyroid treatment went up from 25 mg to 50 mg to 75 mg tablets. In other words, my thyroid was not functioning well.\nThings turned even messier when there was change in my personal life. After marriage, every single day was indeed a happy day but with unhealthy body. Allergy was the major concern.\nThese course of health issues started disturbing my professional life too. I was unable to put my 100% at my work place. Confidence level started dropping, when I had recurred typhoid, drug allergies. I was just missing my social life as I was unable to attend any of the function/party due to the health conditions (both physical and mental).\nThen the research, on good treatment started. Finally I ended up meeting Dr. Disha at motherhood hospital. To be honest when I met her for the first time, I had no clue what treatment she was speaking about. It was something new (which I had never heard or tried ever before).\nToday I thank Dr. Disha for all the best things she added in to my life. The \u201cTruhealing\u201d treatment is not only the treatment for body, but I can confidently say- it is actually a great treatment for your body, - mind and soul. Things what I eat, how I eat; Thoughts- what I think and Action- how I express\u2026 oh! God!! Never ever thought before, all these influence the health of mind, which in turn affects the body.\nThe great thing I learnt from this program are :\n1) What to eat\n2) What not to eat\n3) How to eat\n4) When to eat\n5) What to think\n6) How to express\n7) How to keep myself calm and in peace\n8) How to pray\n9) How to treat others\n10) How to trust myself\n11) How to keep myself strong\n12) How to be happy in life\n13) What things to pick up for life ( Positive or Negative)\nOne of the best thing of this program, which I feel is really awesome is \u2013 People around you will definitely identify the change in you and will start appreciating you for you turned to.\nI feel, there are many more ladies like me round the world- who wanted to overcome many other health issues. I just wish and pray, all such ladies are benefited by this program, lead and stay happy and strong life like meJ\n \nWISH EACH ONE A GREAT, HAPPY, STRONG AND HEALTHY LIFE J\n \n \n \n \n \n",

I had skin issues, PCOD, infertility problems. Dr Disha went through our history & the case patiently, asked many queries and then explained the problem in detail. She also suggested the plan to address all these issues. She doesn't only cure the problems that you visit her for but also heal the overall body. She believes in healing the body through organic food habits. She also helps you stay calm with keeping things very simple.\nWe have met so many doctors for infertility but only Disha was able to address it to the core. Thanks Disha.\nShe is thoroughly professional and very very friendly.\nI got so much self confidence by just interacting with her over the course of last 1.5 years. She is a rare doctor.\nI highly recommend Dr Disha for any gynaec issues.",

Ah, that was a farfetched or next to impossible dream; I just anyhow wanted to have normal regular periods at that time.\r\n\r\nI had enough of birth control pills, its side effects and medication that just pumped hormones.\r\n\r\nAfter trying our luck through even ayurvedic medicine which did not yield much result; we met Dr. Disha Sridhar at Motherhood Hospital, Indiranagar, Bangalore; a very practical doctor & an integrative practitioner who believes in treating problems from its root cause through holistic healing. Her main aim is to treat patients with hormonal imbalances naturally.\r\n\r\nShe was the only doctor who gave positive nod about solving my problems from its core, talked about dissolving my cysts and recovery through natural, non invasive options, no synthetic hormonal pills & balancing my hormones naturally.  I initially thought this was not possible and was sceptical about her way of treatment, wanted to stick to ayurvedic, the proven method, but something within me urged to go forward and with my husband\u2019s unconditional support, I tried it out.  I trusted her and the results are out.\r\n\r\nGradually, my periods started to come back every month without any modern medicines. I started to revive and cherish my feminine energy thus cultivating better positive relationship with my body. I've learned to make my body something I work with as opposed to work against which helped me achieve an ideal sense of health.\r\n\r\nThus, I conceived naturally within four months of embracing healing techniques formulated by Dr. Disha.\r\n\r\nWith a healthy body, I\u2019m enjoying full problem-free, easy, effortless, nurturing pregnancy \u2014 no aches, pains or other issues, creating a smooth transition into my new state of being. \r\n\r\nAll thanks to Dr. Disha Sridhar with whom I\u2019m receiving good antenatal care at Motherhood.  With her, it\u2019s like she shares equal responsibility for my maternity care, right from nutrition, supplements to lifestyle changes. She is the one with whom we can freely talk to about our hopes and fears.\r\n\r\nWith this I would invite you to think differently about PCOS. I healed my body by balancing my hormones and through the opportunity to become a mother; my body has healed my spirit. I wish & believe the same is possible for you too.\r\n-Shreya Nambiar,\r\nBangalore.\r\n",

Be it the bad or the best!!\n\u201cTruhealing\u201d is a program, which helped to give the best, add the essence of positivity to life and have a healthy smile on my face always.\nIn 2012, when I was reported with hypo thyroid \u2013 I had no clue that my life would turn miserable with chains of allergies. By nature, I am a very foody person and I just love to travel and explore new places. I always wish to taste the special food of the place that I visit.\nIt so happened that in 2013 when I had such trip, I developed the first allergy within no time (after I had a food in one of the very good restaurant) suddenly rushed to the doctor and took medicine. To my surprise, even the medicine turned allergic to me. Then I started to hunt for a good treatment to overcome this allergy. Initially all the doctors noted this to be the food allergy. I underwent a food allergy test too. Nothing worked!!! As all the tests resulted as normal.\nMeanwhile the hypothyroid treatment went up from 25 mg to 50 mg to 75 mg tablets. In other words, my thyroid was not functioning well.\nThings turned even messier when there was change in my personal life. After marriage, every single day was indeed a happy day but with unhealthy body. Allergy was the major concern.\nThese course of health issues started disturbing my professional life too. I was unable to put my 100% at my work place. Confidence level started dropping, when I had recurred typhoid, drug allergies. I was just missing my social life as I was unable to attend any of the function/party due to the health conditions (both physical and mental).\nThen the research, on good treatment started. Finally I ended up meeting Dr. Disha at motherhood hospital. To be honest when I met her for the first time, I had no clue what treatment she was speaking about. It was something new (which I had never heard or tried ever before).\nToday I thank Dr. Disha for all the best things she added in to my life. The \u201cTruhealing\u201d treatment is not only the treatment for body, but I can confidently say- it is actually a great treatment for your body, - mind and soul. Things what I eat, how I eat; Thoughts- what I think and Action- how I express\u2026 oh! God!! Never ever thought before, all these influence the health of mind, which in turn affects the body.\nThe great thing I learnt from this program are :\n1) What to eat\n2) What not to eat\n3) How to eat\n4) When to eat\n5) What to think\n6) How to express\n7) How to keep myself calm and in peace\n8) How to pray\n9) How to treat others\n10) How to trust myself\n11) How to keep myself strong\n12) How to be happy in life\n13) What things to pick up for life ( Positive or Negative)\nOne of the best thing of this program, which I feel is really awesome is \u2013 People around you will definitely identify the change in you and will start appreciating you for you turned to.\nI feel, there are many more ladies like me round the world- who wanted to overcome many other health issues. I just wish and pray, all such ladies are benefited by this program, lead and stay happy and strong life like meJ\n \nWISH EACH ONE A GREAT, HAPPY, STRONG AND HEALTHY LIFE J\n \n \n \n \n \n",

I had skin issues, PCOD, infertility problems. Dr Disha went through our history & the case patiently, asked many queries and then explained the problem in detail. She also suggested the plan to address all these issues. She doesn't only cure the problems that you visit her for but also heal the overall body. She believes in healing the body through organic food habits. She also helps you stay calm with keeping things very simple.\nWe have met so many doctors for infertility but only Disha was able to address it to the core. Thanks Disha.\nShe is thoroughly professional and very very friendly.\nI got so much self confidence by just interacting with her over the course of last 1.5 years. She is a rare doctor.\nI highly recommend Dr Disha for any gynaec issues.",

When my blood results were inconclusive,vshe warned me to look out for certain signs. The ultrasound didn't catch it but it ended up being an ectopic pregnancy. I went in with a fallopian tube rupture and massive blood loss. She was not on duty but she rushed back and performed a difficult surgery.\n She is competent in treating hormonal issues and suggesting the right treatment protocols. We have got twins and  I am very happy to recommend her. ",
