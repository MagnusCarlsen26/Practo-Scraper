While I will not provide my own medical details, there were certainly moments that I required not only a highly capable , but also real support. I always felt like she was my advocate, and knew that she was thinking about her patients all the time. In addition to her real care and compassion, she's thinker who is up to date on the latest research and guidelines in the field. That's something important to me. She is an amazing doctor, and I feel lucky to have her as mine.\n\nI like her nature. She is warm, friendly, personable, kind, and sometimes just outright funny. She has the BEST bedside manner, doesn't hold judgement over anything you may say or do, and will provide her medical opinion, but still respect YOUR wishes in spite of her own opinion.\n\nDr. Mamta is quick and efficient. The checkups  are very quick, make sure nothing is wrong, make sure everything looks good, and then she asks if I have questions.  you will know some DON'T even ask if you have questions. And with some, even if you do, they hurry you out the door. Not so with Dr. Mamta. She will sit and answer all your questions if you have them  and she will not make you feel rushed.  I asked all my questions, After headed out the door, and then realized last minute I had forgotten to ask my question a I poked my head in at her office and asked her if I could ask my questions, and she was very accommodating. 'Sure, have a seat, no problem'.\n\nI think if this was something you wanted from Dr. Mamta  she'd be happy to hold your hand and tell you. BUT I think you'd have to let her know that's what you wanted. I mean, she says 'do you have any questions for me, open your mouth and say Yes.\n",

When I went in for a check-up following an emergency room visit.  After that appointment, I switched to her and have been seeing her since.Dr. Mamta was absolutely amazing.  She was always available to answer questions, answering all the queries promptly and was just available if we needed anything.\n\n  She always listened to how I felt and my wishes.  She gave me options and her medical opinion but always deferred to what I wanted.I would highly recommend her to anyone.Dr. Mamta seemed way more interested in treating me as an individual patient, not another appointment in the course of her job.  She always informed me of what she was doing and why.  She also presented options, explained them, and let me choose what I wanted for my treatment.  I really felt like she wanted me to be informed and respected me enough to listen to my concerns.\n\nDr. Mamta was very warm and empathetic.  She's fun and caring, and I will go to her for all my consultations!\n\nMore importantly, the nursing staff was very caring and decent.  I know that is absolutely essential and makes all the difference for your treatment. They were very empathetic and very concerned about my comfort and confidence. I'm not sure the best way to express this. The staff were remarkably well-equipped to respond my emotional needs as well, and they made what could have been a traumatic experience one of the best days of my life.\n\nThanks to them",

She listens to our problems and provides the best suggestions and treatments. There were few test prescribed by the doctor and we found the best results.\n\nHowever the negative part in the clinic is the waiting time. I have visited the clinic for follow up appointments for five times. among these five times three times I have been forced to wait at the clinic for a minimum of 4 hours. This waiting happens just because the staff in the clinic or the clinical management do not follow the first come first serve process. Patients are sent inside for consultation randomly.\n\nTo get confirmation for doctor for very small test reports we have to waste our whole day. This is not a good practice.\n\nAlso when it comes to the administration or the clinical staff, they are not at all professional enough to treat the patients politely. They behave rude.\nApart from all these negatives, Dr. Mamatha Reddy Y V, was a very good doctor.",

Last but definitely not least, Dr. Mamta is the first doctor I felt completely comfortable with.\n\nThank you Marvel Fertility Hospital And Neuro Centre.",

Its a first come and first serve kind of service.. But as i have booked previous appointment with her still i have waited for a long time there So i was totally disappointed that there is no use of taking appointment for her. Few other people also walked out due to the same reason as they have booked appointment but they were waiting in the clinic from the long time. I have only waited there for five to six hours I visited on the weekend but still five to six hours are very huge time to wait.\n\nDoctor was good Next time i went there without any appointment. I also felt there they are having in house laboratory so i felt they have asked all the blood test may be it was required or not. They are having In house pharmacy also they are prescribing unnecessary injections that i felt.They suggested me some injections which cost five hundred for each injection i asked her what will be the use of it is it really require she convened me some how.I felt the clinic is so commercialized.\n\nShe has given me some reason for the injections but i am not satisfied with that reason also.\n",

While I will not provide my own medical details, there were certainly moments that I required not only a highly capable , but also real support. I always felt like she was my advocate, and knew that she was thinking about her patients all the time. In addition to her real care and compassion, she's thinker who is up to date on the latest research and guidelines in the field. That's something important to me. She is an amazing doctor, and I feel lucky to have her as mine.\n\nI like her nature. She is warm, friendly, personable, kind, and sometimes just outright funny. She has the BEST bedside manner, doesn't hold judgement over anything you may say or do, and will provide her medical opinion, but still respect YOUR wishes in spite of her own opinion.\n\nDr. Mamta is quick and efficient. The checkups  are very quick, make sure nothing is wrong, make sure everything looks good, and then she asks if I have questions.  you will know some DON'T even ask if you have questions. And with some, even if you do, they hurry you out the door. Not so with Dr. Mamta. She will sit and answer all your questions if you have them  and she will not make you feel rushed.  I asked all my questions, After headed out the door, and then realized last minute I had forgotten to ask my question a I poked my head in at her office and asked her if I could ask my questions, and she was very accommodating. 'Sure, have a seat, no problem'.\n\nI think if this was something you wanted from Dr. Mamta  she'd be happy to hold your hand and tell you. BUT I think you'd have to let her know that's what you wanted. I mean, she says 'do you have any questions for me, open your mouth and say Yes.\n",

When I went in for a check-up following an emergency room visit.  After that appointment, I switched to her and have been seeing her since.Dr. Mamta was absolutely amazing.  She was always available to answer questions, answering all the queries promptly and was just available if we needed anything.\n\n  She always listened to how I felt and my wishes.  She gave me options and her medical opinion but always deferred to what I wanted.I would highly recommend her to anyone.Dr. Mamta seemed way more interested in treating me as an individual patient, not another appointment in the course of her job.  She always informed me of what she was doing and why.  She also presented options, explained them, and let me choose what I wanted for my treatment.  I really felt like she wanted me to be informed and respected me enough to listen to my concerns.\n\nDr. Mamta was very warm and empathetic.  She's fun and caring, and I will go to her for all my consultations!\n\nMore importantly, the nursing staff was very caring and decent.  I know that is absolutely essential and makes all the difference for your treatment. They were very empathetic and very concerned about my comfort and confidence. I'm not sure the best way to express this. The staff were remarkably well-equipped to respond my emotional needs as well, and they made what could have been a traumatic experience one of the best days of my life.\n\nThanks to them",

I am blessed with baby boy on 26/06/2016 its a normal delivery. She waits for normal delivery till the end. And the staff there,they are very supportive and helpful while I am going through the labor pain.& the best part is,doctor will give her personal phone number while she is expecting that u can get pains & she will respond to your call at any time. The hospital will not let u stay admitted fr many days by showing unnecessary reasons after delivery. \n        I Initially visited her for my miss periods and thyroid problems before I am pregnant. At that time we are nt planning fr pregnancy but she explained my health condition & why its nt good to delay pregnancy fr my health. A right Suggestion at right time will make your life beautiful and happy... \n        I strongly recommend her for any kind of gynic related issues, planning...etc U will be in good hands...One can b blessed with healthy children by her treatment.

She listens to our problems and provides the best suggestions and treatments. There were few test prescribed by the doctor and we found the best results.\n\nHowever the negative part in the clinic is the waiting time. I have visited the clinic for follow up appointments for five times. among these five times three times I have been forced to wait at the clinic for a minimum of 4 hours. This waiting happens just because the staff in the clinic or the clinical management do not follow the first come first serve process. Patients are sent inside for consultation randomly.\n\nTo get confirmation for doctor for very small test reports we have to waste our whole day. This is not a good practice.\n\nAlso when it comes to the administration or the clinical staff, they are not at all professional enough to treat the patients politely. They behave rude.\nApart from all these negatives, Dr. Mamatha Reddy Y V, was a very good doctor.",

Every time I call or come in the lady's at the front engage you right away and get you checked in/out efficiently. The same is true about the nursing staff, friendly, fast and efficient.

Few other people also walked out due to the same reason as they have booked appointment but they were waiting in the clinic from the long time. I have only waited there for five to six hours I visited on the weekend but still five to six hours are very huge time to wait.\n\nDoctor was good Next time i went there without any appointment. I also felt there they are having in house laboratory so i felt they have asked all the blood test may be it was required or not. They are having In house pharmacy also they are prescribing unnecessary injections that i felt.They suggested me some injections which cost five hundred for each injection i asked her what will be the use of it is it really require she convened me some how.I felt the clinic is so commercialized.\n\nShe has given me some reason for the injections but i am not satisfied with that reason also.\n",

I had viginal infection during last days of my delivery she was so supportive and caring she used to cross check everytime with me if I was ok .  She is just a phone call away for her patients.

The medical condition that i have require a lot of overall preventive care that she did not bother to touch upon. The prescription did not even specify the mg. of medicine and I had to call the hospital again to inquire on that.Very surprised by the good reviews on Practo. Best to avoid this doctor if you are looking for someone who is genuinely invested in your health.",
