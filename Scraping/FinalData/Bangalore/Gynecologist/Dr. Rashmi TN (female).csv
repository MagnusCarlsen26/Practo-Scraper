Staff of the hospital is worstt. I have never seen such a lazy, care-less, unresponsive staff. **** ***** ***** ******** ***** *** **** * ******* ** **** * ******** *** they don't bother about patient concern. We need to wait about 2hr approx everytime even though we have booked an appointment. They gives the excuses that there is some urgent surgery etc for being late, rather they should inform patient about delay so that patient can plan their travel to hospital accordingly. Few time i came back without doctor consultation because doctor was busy and urgent surgery and staff didn't inform the patient. Staff don't listen to patient properly and they try to ignore if someone raise a concern about late timings. There is no point of having many people in staff if they are not working with responsibilty. 
At the end , staff is ruining the patient experience with hospital.",2020-01-17 11:18:58,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
