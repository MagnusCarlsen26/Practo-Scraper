I chose Dr. Sowmya after a highly positive feedback from my brother as the doctor treated my 6 year old nieceâ€™s cavities; the child was in terrible pain but after 3 months of treatment she has no pain and no more infection.Dr. Sowmya  was also readily available for follow up consultation on phone for my niece which impressed me. I went to  Dr Sowmya for a teeth clean and also to consult about a cracked tooth. The doctor did an amazing job with the clean and I had zero sensitivity the next day.I am continuing to consult on the cracked tooth and am sure it will be well taken care of.Thanks Doctor.
