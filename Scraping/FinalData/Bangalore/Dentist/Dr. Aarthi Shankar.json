I called both doctors at odd hours and they given advise over phone and at times they cancelled their fixed appointments to see and treat my father.I would give advise those are seeking treatment for their aged patients that they must be clear in their mind about treatments,its approach , recovery time and any consequences which may come on your way,i mean one shouldn't have a any sort of confusion. I am saying it from my experience. ",

I called both doctors at odd hours and they given advise over phone and at times they cancelled their fixed appointments to see and treat my father.I would give advise those are seeking treatment for their aged patients that they must be clear in their mind about treatments,its approach , recovery time and any consequences which may come on your way,i mean one shouldn't have a any sort of confusion. I am saying it from my experience. ",
