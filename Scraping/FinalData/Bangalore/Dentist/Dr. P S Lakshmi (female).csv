"Explanation of the health issue,Wait time,","Cosmetic/ Aesthetic Dentistry,Dental Fillings,RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Crowns and Bridges Fixing,Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"I just moved back to India after a long time and needed some dental work due to pain. I found the doctor on Practo and went in for a consultation. She examined me, explained the procedure and began root canal on the same day. I came back for an extraction and it was done by another doctor. The services are very good. On par with anywhere else in the world. Especially my extraction. Due to my nervousness around medical procedures, and given my anatomy, it’s fair to say that it’s not the easiest for a dentist to work. Having said that, they were very understanding and did a very good job. The crowns are good, and the fitting was perfect. I’m very happy with the quality. Though I have to me mention two things (below). 

Now there is a part of this I was not happy with. One is that they keep changing hands. Doctor, then an assistant one day, someone else the day after that, who clearly is learning. I’m not comfortable with that. Especially if I’m not told in advance. Actually even that I can deal with. I was offered a full ceramic crown (the most expensive one), and the points made to me were - the metal can cause decays and the ceramic is stronger and lasts longer. I went in for the additional expense. Come day of fixing crowns, I happened to notice that the crown was a metal and ceramic combo, which was not what I was told it was. No one was satisfactorily able to explain to me why this was the case. Though, the crowns were eventually re made and I got the full ceramic crowns. 

Overall I would recommend this clinic for dental work.",2020-11-03 09:03:01,False,True,Rajaram Balasubramaniam,,,
