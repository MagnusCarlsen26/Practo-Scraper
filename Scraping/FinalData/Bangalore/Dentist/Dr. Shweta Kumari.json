Her assistant, Dr. Shweta, is also great at what she does\u2014I could tell right away that she knew her job well and could handle any situation that arose during my treatment.

My daughter didn't even feel it.\nI was so happy with her work.\n\n3days before my husband had pain in wisdom tooth. He visited her clinic as per my past experience with Shweta. No doubt in her treatment, he is feeling much better now.\nShe took all safety precautions, must recommended her clinic. Thank you so much Dentist Shweta Kumari for help in this covid situation.",

Although, I would generally not go by only this and do some additional research, i had to take this chance as my dad was in great pain and i wanted an immediate fix. While I was skeptical on how things would go ahead with our visit, i was pleasantly surprised with how things were taken care of. The doctor diagnosed the problem and prescribed some meds for pain and recommended a tooth extraction. This was done by Dr. Irfan who was again very professional in his approach and calmed my dad's nerves, who was anxious as this was his first tooth extraction ever. Later he explained in detail the do's and don'ts. The overall experience was simply good and now i know for sure the place i need to visit for any dental issues. Thank you!",

She took all safety precautions. My daughter was scarred seeing the equipment but i must say Shweta pampered her, made her feel comfortable, diverted her mind and took her teeth within a sec. My daughter didn't even feel it.\nI was so happy with her work.\n\n3days before my husband had pain in wisdom tooth. He visited her clinic as per my past experience with Shweta. No doubt in her treatment, he is feeling much better now.\nShe took all safety precautions, must recommended her clinic. Thank you so much Dentist Shweta Kumari for help in this covid situation.",

Although, I would generally not go by only this and do some additional research, i had to take this chance as my dad was in great pain and i wanted an immediate fix. While I was skeptical on how things would go ahead with our visit, i was pleasantly surprised with how things were taken care of. The doctor diagnosed the problem and prescribed some meds for pain and recommended a tooth extraction. This was done by Dr. Irfan who was again very professional in his approach and calmed my dad's nerves, who was anxious as this was his first tooth extraction ever. Later he explained in detail the do's and don'ts. The overall experience was simply good and now i know for sure the place i need to visit for any dental issues. Thank you!",

                "review_text": "Last Thursday, my son came home with bleeding gums, a loose tooth and deep cuts in and around his lower lip. It was around 9pm, I started driving with my son not quite sure which clinic would be open at \nthat time. I then noticed -  the Dental Office on Harlur road. We rushed in and in a very short while Dr. Shweta attended to my son. Though it was their closing time, she carefully sutured the wound and explained what was to be done.The next day I visited their paediatric dentist who fixed his loose tooth as well.  My son's wound healed within the next 3-4 days.  It was my first experience with Dr. Shweta and her team and I  highly recommend this clinic. ",

However after visiting Dr. Shweta I immediately decided to get the treatment done. She gave me treatment options, managed to complete the treatment in a short time and still maintained high quality. I am very happy with the final outcome and I highly recommend her!",

Many orthodontists declined her case and even suggested a jaw surgery when she reaches 18 years. At that point when we were helpless, my dentist friend suggested us to visit Dr. Byju Mathew. Dr.Byju has done an exceptionally good work on her teeth without the need of surgical procedure. From the first visit in the Dental office he has explained each process very well and was giving clear instructions.  Dr. Shweta also was very cordial and friendly.  My daughter has regained her confidence and her jaws also got aligned perfectly along with her teeth. We are extremely grateful to Dr.Byju and Dental Office for the excellent work which has brought the beautiful smile and confidence back on her face. We recommend Dr.Byju and Dental Office for anyone facing the same issues.",

It was at this time that I realised that the doctor who tended to me was not the periodontist Dr Shweta but someone else. Dr Pratima, I think. \n\nShe was friendly and all, but I was quite disappointed to not have been seen by Dr Shweta. I paid the consultation fees and that was that. I'm not sure why the appointment was confirmed if Dr Shweta was not going to be there. I had had a dental checkup a few weeks back and because the issue of gum-bleeding had persisted, I had wanted to consult a specialist. So this was a let-down.\n\nThis feedback is only wrt the doctor availability and the Practo confirmation. As such, the doctor who saw me was friendly. ",

She operated a flap surgery with bone grafting in just two back to back no time sessions. Now all my infections, bad breath and periodontitis problem are gone and I can feel the freshness.

As I have plans to relocate from the country, there were multiple serious issues concerning my tooth , hence the extensive and prolonged services provided by Dr. Shweta and her expert team is truly commendable. The detailed vigilance, the acute precision, taking X-rays and validating the procedure accuracy, being too caring in regards to pain & sensitivity both towards my fears & tooth situation, everything was really done to perfection. Post treatment care was also performed with due diligence. Time was one of the crucial factor that should be highlighted. She is very punctual and the clinic is very well equipped with all the latest technology. \nI would sincerely highly recommend to avail & attend Dr. Shweta\u2019s clinic as her services is a benchmark in this professional world. Thank You Dr. ",

As you have mentioned, you had wisdom tooth issues , and yes wisdom tooth is an extra tooth so the permanent solution for impaction of wisdom tooth is extraction( removal) only that we suggested as  we don't believe in any quick fix but permanent solution of problem.Your pain was primarily because of wisdom tooth so we were insisting on that, as we also don't want a prolonged treatment for a patient in this covid times ( many visits to clinic).\nAgain wisdom tooth problem involves defenitely an extraction as permanent solution as it is an extra tooth. \n2.we did not find any cavities and we adhere with our diagnosis as food can be stuck in many places, even between two teeth with gaps.When there is no cavities , only discoloration we just can't label it as cavities and do filling.That kind of unethical work we don't do.\nThanks",
