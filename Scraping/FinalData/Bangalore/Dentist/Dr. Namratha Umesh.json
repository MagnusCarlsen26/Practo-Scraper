She is an expert in her field, totally dedicated, fully committed. \nMore than all these professional attributes, her personal qualities weighs more. When you first meet her, you will realize you met a sister, or a mother or a friend rather than a doctor. She is very friendly and make one feel very comfortable.  In other clinics as you enter, you open your mouth and submit yourself to doctor for examinations.  Here as you enter , you open your mouth to have a brief talk on anything like weather , garbage etc before examination. That way one does not feel he/she is in a dental clinic. It is so homely. That is the specialty of this clinic. \nProfessionally she is highly qualified (MDS) and very sincere and committed to her job. She wants challenges and loves to have such challenging cases. Her aptitude for research motivates her to accept challenges in dental cases. She has a very sharp memory, ably assisted by thousands of her case study photos in her mobile. She instantly recalls a similar case and fishes out the photograph of case study and with that she explains to the patients the case and the procedure she wishes to suggest.  It will be so convincing that, one will have no alternative but to say yes. \nShe is so compassionate to elders that she is flexible in the charges for them. \nI had two occasions to go to her. One for a root canal and another to fill up broken teeth.  In both case she did an excellent job. \nShe is very particular about the Hygiene and that is an important factor for her.  \nThese are my personal opinion based on the experience I had and I felt that  good things should  be shared for benefit of others too. \n\nVenugopal HN\nSahakaranagara \n**********\n\n \n\n",

The doctor examined for a few minutes and read me the death sentence of my teeth i.e. unless treatment is started immediately. It seems I had an advanced stage of gum infection called Periodontal. The word sounded strange, scary and is a word which you feel instantly that there is no hope. She basically outlined the impossible treatment \u2013 extraction, cleaning, implants, gum surgery, tissue grafting and so on. To me it looked like a long and painful journey and top of it all this had to be done in a month since I was scheduled for a long stint abroad from August.\n \n\nSomehow I was confident about it, in the hands of Dr.Namaratha\u2019s I was sure this would not be too bad. And now after the treatment my confidence was not misplaced. Indeed the treatment consisting of all the above strange procedures went without a hitch \u2013 I have a brand new set of teeth, my gums are clean and I can eat and smile as much as I want nowJ\n\n \n\nSo I am extremely thankful to Dr. Namratha and her support staff for having given me the best possible treatment with  care \u2013 all within in the promised timeframe and budget.\n\n \n\nI wish her and the clinic \u2013 Dental Conceptz a grand success in future.\n\n \n\nVOLVO CAR CORPORATION         \nMed v\u00e4nlig h\u00e4lsning / Best regards\n\nRajesh Tengli\n\nVOLVO CAR CORPORATION\n94770 Connected Infotainment\nTorslanda PV32\nSE-405 31 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden\nvolvocars.com\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n",

She is an expert in her field, totally dedicated, fully committed. \nMore than all these professional attributes, her personal qualities weighs more. When you first meet her, you will realize you met a sister, or a mother or a friend rather than a doctor. She is very friendly and make one feel very comfortable.  In other clinics as you enter, you open your mouth and submit yourself to doctor for examinations.  Here as you enter , you open your mouth to have a brief talk on anything like weather , garbage etc before examination. That way one does not feel he/she is in a dental clinic. It is so homely. That is the specialty of this clinic. \nProfessionally she is highly qualified (MDS) and very sincere and committed to her job. She wants challenges and loves to have such challenging cases. Her aptitude for research motivates her to accept challenges in dental cases. She has a very sharp memory, ably assisted by thousands of her case study photos in her mobile. She instantly recalls a similar case and fishes out the photograph of case study and with that she explains to the patients the case and the procedure she wishes to suggest.  It will be so convincing that, one will have no alternative but to say yes. \nShe is so compassionate to elders that she is flexible in the charges for them. \nI had two occasions to go to her. One for a root canal and another to fill up broken teeth.  In both case she did an excellent job. \nShe is very particular about the Hygiene and that is an important factor for her.  \nThese are my personal opinion based on the experience I had and I felt that  good things should  be shared for benefit of others too. \n\nVenugopal HN\nSahakaranagara \n**********\n\n \n\n",

The doctor examined for a few minutes and read me the death sentence of my teeth i.e. unless treatment is started immediately. It seems I had an advanced stage of gum infection called Periodontal. The word sounded strange, scary and is a word which you feel instantly that there is no hope. She basically outlined the impossible treatment \u2013 extraction, cleaning, implants, gum surgery, tissue grafting and so on. To me it looked like a long and painful journey and top of it all this had to be done in a month since I was scheduled for a long stint abroad from August.\n \n\nSomehow I was confident about it, in the hands of Dr.Namaratha\u2019s I was sure this would not be too bad. And now after the treatment my confidence was not misplaced. Indeed the treatment consisting of all the above strange procedures went without a hitch \u2013 I have a brand new set of teeth, my gums are clean and I can eat and smile as much as I want nowJ\n\n \n\nSo I am extremely thankful to Dr. Namratha and her support staff for having given me the best possible treatment with  care \u2013 all within in the promised timeframe and budget.\n\n \n\nI wish her and the clinic \u2013 Dental Conceptz a grand success in future.\n\n \n\nVOLVO CAR CORPORATION         \nMed v\u00e4nlig h\u00e4lsning / Best regards\n\nRajesh Tengli\n\nVOLVO CAR CORPORATION\n94770 Connected Infotainment\nTorslanda PV32\nSE-405 31 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden\nvolvocars.com\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n",

Apart from being thoroughly professional in diagnosing and coming up with a plan to fix my teeth, her over all personality and her reassuring nature, calmed me and overall make the usually horrendous visits to a dentist, completely enjoyable and fear-free. I am almost at the end of my treatment right now, and I can assure you that I will not need to see a dentist for a very long time (even though I will miss visiting her :P ). Also, she is quite the expert when it comes to implant (Remember the next time you need one, even I will be going back to her for one!). Overall, my first experience with a dentist that I will not relate to a nightmare!!!",
