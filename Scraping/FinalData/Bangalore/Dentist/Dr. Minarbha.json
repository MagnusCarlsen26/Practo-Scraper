Dr. Minerva and staff were so graceful that almost immediately I felt I am in the safe hands. Dr Minerva made me so comfortable that I feel doctor felt the pain more than me, she was like a mother who feels the pain of her child, she clearly explained what is happened and the entire procedure needed to be done... Due to the complexity of my case she took an extra sitting but never ever I felt a pain.\n\nAnd the staff at the clinic are so scheduled and punctual that based on your appointment they are almost ready to treat you before you are there at clinic and they also ensure follow up with patient on the status which makes you feel so ease that they are really concerned for the patient \n\nDr. Minerva and staff you are awesome . I have no doubt in my mind, that smiley house is the place for any dental support that you will ever have and I recommend this place for everyone ",

My wife had a unbearable tooth ache in her decayed wisdom tooth. Dr.Minerbha suggested us with surgery for extraction with a specialist after the scan. Extraction was done by surgeon with so much of ease which shows thier immense experience. we also found the adjacent tooth was infected too , so went ahead with RCT again with a specialist which got completed in single sitting itself. Smiley house clinic is so clean, even during covid time they maintained all precautions to avoid contamination. The price for the treatment is also very reasonable for the standards they provide. overall we are happy with Smiley house dental and Dr.Minerbha.We High recommend her.",

Dr. Minerva and staff were so graceful that almost immediately I felt I am in the safe hands. Dr Minerva made me so comfortable that I feel doctor felt the pain more than me, she was like a mother who feels the pain of her child, she clearly explained what is happened and the entire procedure needed to be done... Due to the complexity of my case she took an extra sitting but never ever I felt a pain.\n\nAnd the staff at the clinic are so scheduled and punctual that based on your appointment they are almost ready to treat you before you are there at clinic and they also ensure follow up with patient on the status which makes you feel so ease that they are really concerned for the patient \n\nDr. Minerva and staff you are awesome . I have no doubt in my mind, that smiley house is the place for any dental support that you will ever have and I recommend this place for everyone ",

Extraction was done by surgeon with so much of ease which shows thier immense experience. we also found the adjacent tooth was infected too , so went ahead with RCT again with a specialist which got completed in single sitting itself. Smiley house clinic is so clean, even during covid time they maintained all precautions to avoid contamination. The price for the treatment is also very reasonable for the standards they provide. overall we are happy with Smiley house dental and Dr.Minerbha.We High recommend her.",
