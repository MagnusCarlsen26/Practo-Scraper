"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,"I generally dont write reviews but it was a very good experience with this duo.

I had severe toothache but the reason was because of wisdom tooth. Doctor suggested to go for extraction.

Firstly when i spoke to Dr. Kavitha and she could sense that I am too scared for any extraction, she comforted me saying that I can just come, get the tooth checked and if i dont wish to continue i can leave it. But not to worry. That itself was too comforting. I decided to go there.

After going there, didn’t have to wait at all.

Dr. Srihari and Dr. Kavitha were have given time quickly. I explained to them that I am too scared of pricks or anything and i tend to faint.

Dr. Srihari has also again comforted me during the whole procedure. I was feeling uncomfortable after first injection and to that he was way too much patient with me.

When he removed the tooth, it took him literally 2-5 min but i think the team spent more than 15 min to make me calm in that place.

I may not have gone ahead if they were not this patient.

I know they have given their valuable time to me and gone extra mile to make me feel comfortable.

Dr. Kavitha has also personally been checking on me after the procedure on the conditions.

I would certainly recommend the duo.

Thanks a lot doctor.
