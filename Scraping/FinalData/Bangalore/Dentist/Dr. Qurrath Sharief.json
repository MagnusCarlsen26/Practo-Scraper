This was very disappointing as this was told to me suddenly.During my third visit I was told it would cost 11000 for capping. When I visited fourth time it was told to me that I need to pay Rs 1200 more. I hope correct diagnosis is done so that the patient can take informed decision whether to proceed or not with the treatment.",

Next session when I visited I was told that main purpose of the pain was not wisdom teeth but a RCT is required. This was very disappointing as this was told to me suddenly.During my third visit I was told it would cost 11000 for capping. When I visited fourth time it was told to me that I need to pay Rs 1200 more. I hope correct diagnosis is done so that the patient can take informed decision whether to proceed or not with the treatment.",
