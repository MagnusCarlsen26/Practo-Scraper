But also so much more\n\nAfter 18 months of braces treatment with another doctor, who had slowly convinced me that I had gum issues ( which I did not), I was convinced that my smile would never be as I imagined it would be. \n\nOne day after yet another consultation where the doctor tried to scare me further, something snapped and I decided to take a second opinion. \n\nThat was the lucky day I met Dr. Chetak and I clearly remember it. \n\nI was lost, looked like I\u2019d just recovered from a panic attack, and launched myself into a monologue about how my gum problems would fail my braces treatment. \n\nThe doctor smiled and said, but who said you have a gum problem? \n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it after 18 months of being told something was terribly wrong.  Turned out everything was ok except for an overbite.\n\n\nThat day and every consultation after changed my smile and outlook toward dentists. \n\nDr.Chetak is very accomplished, popular, and experienced. Yet, he will remember patient history, hear them out as they rant, answer all the questions they may have, and give them the best possible result going out of his way. This is not just based on my experiences. I have noticed the quality of interactions he has with school kids, adults, or the elderly. I cannot think of a more optimistic and thoughtful dentist in all of Bangalore. He can bring out the best in his patients. He explains everything in detail and never loses his calm.\n\nOver the last 6 months, he fixed my overbite issues very strategically, and accommodated my timeline amidst a very busy schedule and multiple lockdowns, all because I requested it. He went out of his way to accommodate a complicated permanent retainer just to minimize a relapse -- something others said would not be possible with the overbite!\n\nToday, as he removed my braces to present a smile that beats my imagination, I am filled with gratitude. Very few dentists can do this tactically brilliant job. Almost nobody can do it without instilling fear in the patient or overcharging them. Only Dr.Chetak managed to do all of it!\n\nIf you need a good orthodontist, look no further. You will get a smile you love and meet a doctor who will set very high standards for all those you meet later. \n\nThank you, doctor, although it is too small a word. I owe you my smile. Quite literally! :) \n\n\n",

For few days she tolerated pain, but as pain grew a lot, we visited Dr. Shetty at Fortis Hospital. He is very professional,  skillful and gentle. He gave her options that were suited for her that we were not aware of. He made her feel extremely comfortable and which was not easy with a pregnant lady sitting in the dental chair. He advised to get wisdom tooth removed as there was no space, which caused the bones to expand. He called in a senior anesthetist for consultation as my wife was pregnant. He cracked few jokes to make her relax and comfortable. The procedure went on very smooth and fast, she didn\u2019t even realize once it was done. We were quite happy with the wonderful work done by Dr Shetty. Every step was explained to us, they even allowed me to stand beside my wife to make her feel supported and most importantly safe. \r\n\r\nI wish there were enough words for us to say thank you. I\u2019m sure he will be keep working in his field with more sophisticated approach. We highly recommend him and have even referred few of our friends for dental work. Great communication and fantastic work!",

What my previous doctor told would take a year or more to complete, Dr. Shetty finished it in 6-7 months. That's how fast his treatment is, not just with me but with all the other patients.\n\nHe is good-humored, understanding, and listens to all your problems with patience. At the end of the treatment, I was not only left with beautifully aligned teeth but also with an inspiration to be as passionate and as professional as he is. Thank you, sir. You made me smile more often!",

But also so much more\n\nAfter 18 months of braces treatment with another doctor, who had slowly convinced me that I had gum issues ( which I did not), I was convinced that my smile would never be as I imagined it would be. \n\nOne day after yet another consultation where the doctor tried to scare me further, something snapped and I decided to take a second opinion. \n\nThat was the lucky day I met Dr. Chetak and I clearly remember it. \n\nI was lost, looked like I\u2019d just recovered from a panic attack, and launched myself into a monologue about how my gum problems would fail my braces treatment. \n\nThe doctor smiled and said, but who said you have a gum problem? \n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it after 18 months of being told something was terribly wrong.  Turned out everything was ok except for an overbite.\n\n\nThat day and every consultation after changed my smile and outlook toward dentists. \n\nDr.Chetak is very accomplished, popular, and experienced. Yet, he will remember patient history, hear them out as they rant, answer all the questions they may have, and give them the best possible result going out of his way. This is not just based on my experiences. I have noticed the quality of interactions he has with school kids, adults, or the elderly. I cannot think of a more optimistic and thoughtful dentist in all of Bangalore. He can bring out the best in his patients. He explains everything in detail and never loses his calm.\n\nOver the last 6 months, he fixed my overbite issues very strategically, and accommodated my timeline amidst a very busy schedule and multiple lockdowns, all because I requested it. He went out of his way to accommodate a complicated permanent retainer just to minimize a relapse -- something others said would not be possible with the overbite!\n\nToday, as he removed my braces to present a smile that beats my imagination, I am filled with gratitude. Very few dentists can do this tactically brilliant job. Almost nobody can do it without instilling fear in the patient or overcharging them. Only Dr.Chetak managed to do all of it!\n\nIf you need a good orthodontist, look no further. You will get a smile you love and meet a doctor who will set very high standards for all those you meet later. \n\nThank you, doctor, although it is too small a word. I owe you my smile. Quite literally! :) \n\n\n",

For few days she tolerated pain, but as pain grew a lot, we visited Dr. Shetty at Fortis Hospital. He is very professional,  skillful and gentle. He gave her options that were suited for her that we were not aware of. He made her feel extremely comfortable and which was not easy with a pregnant lady sitting in the dental chair. He advised to get wisdom tooth removed as there was no space, which caused the bones to expand. He called in a senior anesthetist for consultation as my wife was pregnant. He cracked few jokes to make her relax and comfortable. The procedure went on very smooth and fast, she didn\u2019t even realize once it was done. We were quite happy with the wonderful work done by Dr Shetty. Every step was explained to us, they even allowed me to stand beside my wife to make her feel supported and most importantly safe. \r\n\r\nI wish there were enough words for us to say thank you. I\u2019m sure he will be keep working in his field with more sophisticated approach. We highly recommend him and have even referred few of our friends for dental work. Great communication and fantastic work!",

What my previous doctor told would take a year or more to complete, Dr. Shetty finished it in 6-7 months. That's how fast his treatment is, not just with me but with all the other patients.\n\nHe is good-humored, understanding, and listens to all your problems with patience. At the end of the treatment, I was not only left with beautifully aligned teeth but also with an inspiration to be as passionate and as professional as he is. Thank you, sir. You made me smile more often!",

Once he met doc , who looked very friendly & know how to put people into ease soon as they meet him not only by words but also through his professional touch to every aspect of treatment either in detailing the ongoing treatment or the details about the upcoming schedule & treatment.
