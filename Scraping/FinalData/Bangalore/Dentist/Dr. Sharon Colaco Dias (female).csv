"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Implant Fixing,",0,0,YES,"I recently underwent a dental implant procedure at Life Time Dental in Marathalli, Bengaluru, and I am delighted to share my outstanding experience with Dr. Sharon. My journey with Dr. Sharon began 15 years ago when I sought her expertise for a root canal and crown procedure. Remarkably, the crown she provided lasted a phenomenal 15 years, far surpassing the expected lifespan of 7 years. This alone speaks volumes about Dr. Sharon's proficiency and commitment to her patients' long-term oral health.

Returning to Dr. Sharon for the implant procedure, I was once again impressed by her exceptional skill and efficiency. From the moment I walked into her office, I felt reassured by her warm demeanor and confident approach. Dr. Sharon meticulously explained every aspect of the implant process, ensuring that I felt fully informed and comfortable throughout.

What truly sets Dr. Sharon apart is her unparalleled speed and efficiency in performing the implant procedure. In my opinion, she is unmatched in her field, delivering results with remarkable precision and swiftness. The implant she provided not only looks incredibly natural but also functions flawlessly, enhancing both my smile and confidence.

I must also commend the entire team at Life Time Dental for their professionalism and dedication to patient care. From the receptionists to the dental assistants, everyone contributed to making my experience seamless and enjoyable.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Sharon and Life Time Dental to anyone seeking top-notch dental care in Bengaluru. Dr. Sharon's exceptional skill, coupled with her dedication to patient satisfaction, makes her the go-to dentist for anyone in need of dental implants or other procedures.
