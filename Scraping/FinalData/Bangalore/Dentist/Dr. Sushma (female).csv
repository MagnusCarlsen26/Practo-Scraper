"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Implant Rehabilitation,",0,0,YES,"During my mother's visit to the dental clinic, we were pleased to find that the doctor was not only skilled but also incredibly polite and helpful. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, which immediately put us at ease.

The reason for our visit was severe pain due to a cavity in her teeth. The doctor took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure and answer any questions or concerns we had. This clear communication was reassuring and made us feel confident in the care provided.

The procedures, from the initial examination to addressing the cavity, went exceptionally well. My mother experienced minimal discomfort, and the doctor's expertise was evident throughout. The level of professionalism and attention to detail was truly commendable.

We left the clinic with a sense of satisfaction, knowing that my mother had received top-notch care, and her dental concern had been successfully addressed. It's wonderful to have found a dental clinic with such a dedicated and friendly team. We look forward to returning for any future dental needs.",2023-11-01 15:52:06,False,True,Mohammed toufiq kadar,,,
