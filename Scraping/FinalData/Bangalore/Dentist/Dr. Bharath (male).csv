Thank you doctor. 

But, coming back to my experience, Dr. Bharath patiently listens to your problems,  suggests treatment, and makes sure you're fine. He never suggests anything that's unreasonable.  He in fact did a re root canal as another dentist had spoiled it for me. I was in deep pain for almost 2 months. Dr. Bharath gave me confidence that it can be corrected. And, as he promised, he corrected it, didn't suggest to go for new set of crowns and made the existing ones work for me.

I would definitely recommend Dr. Bharath  to anyone who's looking for a good dentist in and around Singasandra.
