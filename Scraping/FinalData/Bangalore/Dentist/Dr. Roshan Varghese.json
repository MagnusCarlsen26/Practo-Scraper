Even arranged for a mouthwash that was not easily available. He has a team of specialists who all seem as calm and practised as him. My complete procedure will take around three months but so far I am very satisfied with the consultation. ",

And has attended to all my doubts on phone. Although the fracture was detected at the end, he was good enough to check my condition through the week several times before the surgery. Even arranged for a mouthwash that was not easily available. He has a team of specialists who all seem as calm and practised as him. My complete procedure will take around three months but so far I am very satisfied with the consultation. ",
