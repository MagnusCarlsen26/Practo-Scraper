It's because of the excellent and timely treatment given by them that I was able to go on a short vacation. At the end of the treatment, I was given a detailed report of what's done so far, and what's to be done later, along with the x-rays taken during my treatment, which  will enable me to get treatment in future by dentists in my place of residence. The supportive staff - Mr. Raghu, the dental assistant, and Ms Anitha, the clinic administrator - were also kind, polite, and courteous. The follow ups done by Ms Anitha after every stage of treatment show the care and concern they have for the patients.\nHighly recommended. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

It's because of the excellent and timely treatment given by them that I was able to go on a short vacation. At the end of the treatment, I was given a detailed report of what's done so far, and what's to be done later, along with the x-rays taken during my treatment, which  will enable me to get treatment in future by dentists in my place of residence. The supportive staff - Mr. Raghu, the dental assistant, and Ms Anitha, the clinic administrator - were also kind, polite, and courteous. The follow ups done by Ms Anitha after every stage of treatment show the care and concern they have for the patients.\nHighly recommended. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
