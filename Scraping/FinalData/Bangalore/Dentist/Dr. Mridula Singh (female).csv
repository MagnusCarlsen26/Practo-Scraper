I know that I am a very difficult patient to handle and when I visited other clinics they had a complain about this but here Dr. Mridula never took it as an issue and handled everything very well.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Toothache,",0,0,YES,I had visited a clinic previously for my mother.   She is a very aged patient. I really got frustrated due to the multiple appointments as there were specialists coming for each procedure. Even after so much of visits and getting it done from specialists the treatment had failed in a year. Later I visited Avishi Dental Clinic. Here Dr.  Mridula performs all the treatment by her self and finishes multiple visit work in single sitting itself.  That was quite impressive.  Within a day of treatment my mother was completely satisfied by the way the doctor handled her. Even though the charges are on a little higher side but she deserves it for the quality of work she does. I am very happy to have visited Dr.  Mridula.

Orthodontic treatments span across a certain amount of time and you always wanted to rush with the treatment. This was the same when we initiated the treatment for you and within a mere span of 2 months you were miraculously expecting results and without even raising a concern with us you ended up putting a negative review. Post this we made you understand the entire procedure to which you complied and you yourself took the review down. Due to the current situation we could not schedule cases that is not an emergency but we made sure to keep following up with our patients. But you were impatient even after the specialist recommending for the treatment to go along for some more months. You willingly took initiative to cessate the treatment gleefully saying that you were happy with the treatment done. We prioritize on making treatments as conservative as possible thereby retaining natural teeth. Your profile was impossible to be corrected without extractions. You yourself can compare your profiles now to how drastic the change has been. Atleast you could have raised a concern with us instead of happily going and repeating the same behaviour.
