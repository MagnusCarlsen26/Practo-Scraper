The x ray revealed decay on the right lower wisdom tooth which inturn affected the adjacent teeth.\nI was extremely uncomfortable when i was told 3 of my teeth had to be extracted and one filling to prevent a root canal.\nDr Kirshna Mohan and team conducted the extraction without even making me realize that I was being operated. While I sensed from my x ray that one of the tooth required a complex extraction, the team througout demonstrated competency in their field of work.\n\nFinally, my main reasons for recommending the clinic are as below:\n\na) Friendly staff who know how to greet a patient under pain\nb) Doctor who can thoroughly describe the potential issues and propose tailored solutions ( if travelling)\nc) Never displayed a sign of worry/complexity while operating which puts the patient at ease\nd) ****** **** ********* ** ******** ***** ** ********* ** can easily describe effects of a dental procedure on other areas of body.\ne) A very good listener. Listens to your complete problem and only then diagonizes.\nf) Value for the money you pay\n",

Right now, I'm not getting any pain due to sensitivity and my problem resolved. I'm very happy with the way Dr Krishna Mohan treated my dental issues and I strongly recommend him for any kind of dental problems. Thanks a lot Sir. ",

While I sensed from my x ray that one of the tooth required a complex extraction, the team througout demonstrated competency in their field of work.\n\nFinally, my main reasons for recommending the clinic are as below:\n\na) Friendly staff who know how to greet a patient under pain\nb) Doctor who can thoroughly describe the potential issues and propose tailored solutions ( if travelling)\nc) Never displayed a sign of worry/complexity while operating which puts the patient at ease\nd) ****** **** ********* ** ******** ***** ** ********* ** can easily describe effects of a dental procedure on other areas of body.\ne) A very good listener.

And asked me to visit for every 6months without paying single rupee. It was really a great treatment experience with Dentoscope and Doctor Krishna Mohan. Right now, I'm not getting any pain due to sensitivity and my problem resolved. I'm very happy with the way Dr Krishna Mohan treated my dental issues and I strongly recommend him for any kind of dental problems. Thanks a lot Sir. ",

He does not rush things and spend time explaining the options and risks. Overall it has been a great experience. I can easily reach out to the Doctor for any follow up concerns from USA.\nI went through fast loading dental implants, traditional implant on one side and also crown placement.

He extracted the tooth with so much ease and less time .. He gave an injection and my friend had a comfortable journey without any trace of pain. Ever since then am a fan of this doctor ..He explains really well and was recommended by my family friend.. will always Want to visit him only for any tooth issues .. who makes going to dentist more of a comfortable visit than a painful memory.",
