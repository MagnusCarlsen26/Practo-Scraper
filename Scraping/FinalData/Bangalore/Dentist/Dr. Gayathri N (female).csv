"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Fillings,re-root canal,",0,0,YES,"I had the pleasure of taking my daughter to Gayathri N's dental clinic for her dental treatment, and I must say it was an excellent experience. From start to finish, the entire process was very good and hygienic, which put my mind at ease as a parent.

Gayathri N's expertise and care were evident throughout the treatment. She was not only professional but also very compassionate towards my daughter, who was initially quite scared about visiting the dentist. The way she interacted with my daughter and made her feel comfortable was truly commendable. It made a significant difference in how my daughter perceived the dental visit.

The treatment itself was top-notch. Gayathri N showed great skill and proficiency in handling the dental issue, and the results were outstanding. I felt confident in her abilities, and it was evident that she takes great pride in her work.

I cannot thank Gayathri N enough for the wonderful care she provided to my daughter. The entire experience was pleasant, and my daughter's oral health has significantly improved. I am delighted with the results and grateful to the dentist for making this process so smooth and anxiety-free.

Overall, I can confidently say that Gayathri N is an exceptional dentist. Her expertise, hygiene standards, and caring approach make her stand out in her field. I am more than satisfied with the treatment my daughter received, and I would highly recommend her to anyone in need of dental care. Without a doubt, she deserves a perfect score of 100 out of 100.
