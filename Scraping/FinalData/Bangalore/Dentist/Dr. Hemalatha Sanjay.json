                "review_text": "Dr. Hemalatha is definitely one of the best orthodontists in Bangalore. I'm undergoing a braces treatment by her and am extremely happy with the progress. \r\n\r\nOne of my upper front teeth had chipped off in an accident and I also had multiple wide gaps between them. Before taking her opinion, I consulted 2 other dentists who simply for the sake of making more money, advised me to get a cap by grinding off the half chipped tooth along with the braces treatment. I would have started my treatment at either of them but luckily for me, I decided to take another opinion and booked an appointment at her clinic via Practo. Only she suggested a non-disruptive way of treatment to sustain my natural tooth without compromising on the final outcome. \r\n\r\nShe is extremely well spoken and explains everything in a very calm and composed manner. She explained me the entire treatment plan and the challenges one faces with braces. She patiently listened to my every query and cleared all my doubts. It is evident that she really cares about her work and diligently tries to achieve the best possible result. She treats every patient equally and doesn\u2019t haste in her treatment or talks. Unlike other clinics where orthodontists visit once a month, she is available 24-6 at her clinic. It is a great plus point in case of emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe clinic is very well equipped and the entire experience there is quite decent. The only problem is that appointments don\u2019t start on time and I normally have to wait for a sufficiently large amount of time ranging from 30 minutes to an hour. The fees is a bit on the higher side but in my opinion, is justified for the treatment she offers. ",

I'm undergoing a braces treatment by her and am extremely happy with the progress. \r\n\r\nOne of my upper front teeth had chipped off in an accident and I also had multiple wide gaps between them. Before taking her opinion, I consulted 2 other dentists who simply for the sake of making more money, advised me to get a cap by grinding off the half chipped tooth along with the braces treatment. I would have started my treatment at either of them but luckily for me, I decided to take another opinion and booked an appointment at her clinic via Practo. Only she suggested a non-disruptive way of treatment to sustain my natural tooth without compromising on the final outcome. \r\n\r\nShe is extremely well spoken and explains everything in a very calm and composed manner. She explained me the entire treatment plan and the challenges one faces with braces. She patiently listened to my every query and cleared all my doubts. It is evident that she really cares about her work and diligently tries to achieve the best possible result. She treats every patient equally and doesn\u2019t haste in her treatment or talks. Unlike other clinics where orthodontists visit once a month, she is available 24-6 at her clinic. It is a great plus point in case of emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe clinic is very well equipped and the entire experience there is quite decent. The only problem is that appointments don\u2019t start on time and I normally have to wait for a sufficiently large amount of time ranging from 30 minutes to an hour. The fees is a bit on the higher side but in my opinion, is justified for the treatment she offers. ",
