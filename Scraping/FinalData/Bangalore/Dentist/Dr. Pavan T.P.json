I was getting sensitivity in the lower tooth as well. He explained to me that the pain radiates at times and that the tooth doesn\u2019t need any treatment. I found his suggestion very honest. I found Dr. Pavan and his team very professional in their approach. They have a very systematic process in place and everyone there, including the staff assisting the doctors, follow the process very meticulously. It is very assuring and comforting for a patient when the clinic makes it a point to explain the procedure, treatment, post care, medication, etc in detail and follows up over call to know well being of the patient after the treatment. They did not rush through the process but gave good time to do the RC. Post RC also I was explained the further process and options available for capping the tooth. I was given the best possible solution for me and was not suggested to go for the costliest one just for the sake of it. I found his approach very pragmatic. I am very much satisfied with the treatment and the best solution I got. Thanks to Dr. Pavan and his team.",

Dr.Pavan listened with patience my pain and suggested it needs a visit to check depth of the decay. Also equally concerning was visiting dental clinic in this COVID situations. Dr.Pavan put it in simple words which gave me confidence to visit his clinic, he mentioned \"They are taking all precautions, to provide the most safe treatment considering COVID situation\", also \"It is upto the one getting treated who has to take precautions before coming to Clinic\". \n\nI visited the clinic, the pain and decay was severe, Dr.Pavan suggested for a treatment. I took the treatment as suggested and followed all safety process and precautions. His clinic is taking all precautions, and doctors are wearing safety kits while treatment. \n\nMy teeth issue is resolved and I am most thankful to get treatment from him and his clinic.

We would like to address the issues you mentioned in your review.\n\nYou visited us due to an emergency dental issue during lock-down. During tele-consultation, you mentioned severe toothache due to a dental procedure of tooth filling, from another dentist a week prior to visiting us. After this, you were asked to visit the clinic with\u00a0an emergency appointment. During consultation at the clinic, you clearly mentioned that you didn't have a\u00a0toothache, but a headache.\u00a0\n\nWith this background, upon examination by our specialist dentist, it was found that the filling was technically appropriate\u00a0and did not require a refilling,\u00a0and you didn't have\u00a0a toothache. This was communicated while you were at the clinic. But, you insisted that we re-do the filling.\n\nWe followed all protocols necessary to diagnose you and advise as we did.\n\nWith the current lockdown on essential services, filling / re-filling of the tooth is not considered an emergency\u00a0treatment but an elective treatment, and doing the\u00a0same would be a malpractice, subjecting the specialist to be penalised. Please do note that you have also signed a consent form saying that you have visited us only for an emergency treatment considering current pandemic.  It is indeed shocking to know that you had your teeth re-filled\u00a0from another dentist, which is against medical code. \u00a0\n\nAs a dental clinic, we give utmost care for our patients, and please note that\u00a0treatment regimen cannot be executed on directives\u00a0from the patient, on the basis of his/her instincts. We also would like to mention that you were asked not to pay the consultation fee, but you insisted and paid.\u00a0\n\nAs Doctors, we are trained to give our best for our patients\u2019 treatment, of which the prognosis is a scientific\u00a0approach based on logic, keeping in mind the patients' future health in\u00a0mind.\n\nWe always make sure to provide the most detailed examination and appropriate treatment to the best standard possible, with a whole overview approach to ensure long term dental health.\n\nTeam Credence",

I was getting sensitivity in the lower tooth as well. He explained to me that the pain radiates at times and that the tooth doesn\u2019t need any treatment. I found his suggestion very honest. I found Dr. Pavan and his team very professional in their approach. They have a very systematic process in place and everyone there, including the staff assisting the doctors, follow the process very meticulously. It is very assuring and comforting for a patient when the clinic makes it a point to explain the procedure, treatment, post care, medication, etc in detail and follows up over call to know well being of the patient after the treatment. They did not rush through the process but gave good time to do the RC. Post RC also I was explained the further process and options available for capping the tooth. I was given the best possible solution for me and was not suggested to go for the costliest one just for the sake of it. I found his approach very pragmatic. I am very much satisfied with the treatment and the best solution I got. Thanks to Dr. Pavan and his team.",

Dr.Pavan listened with patience my pain and suggested it needs a visit to check depth of the decay. Also equally concerning was visiting dental clinic in this COVID situations. Dr.Pavan put it in simple words which gave me confidence to visit his clinic, he mentioned \"They are taking all precautions, to provide the most safe treatment considering COVID situation\", also \"It is upto the one getting treated who has to take precautions before coming to Clinic\". \n\nI visited the clinic, the pain and decay was severe, Dr.Pavan suggested for a treatment. I took the treatment as suggested and followed all safety process and precautions. His clinic is taking all precautions, and doctors are wearing safety kits while treatment. \n\nMy teeth issue is resolved and I am most thankful to get treatment from him and his clinic.

We would like to address the issues you mentioned in your review.\n\nYou visited us due to an emergency dental issue during lock-down. During tele-consultation, you mentioned severe toothache due to a dental procedure of tooth filling, from another dentist a week prior to visiting us. After this, you were asked to visit the clinic with\u00a0an emergency appointment. During consultation at the clinic, you clearly mentioned that you didn't have a\u00a0toothache, but a headache.\u00a0\n\nWith this background, upon examination by our specialist dentist, it was found that the filling was technically appropriate\u00a0and did not require a refilling,\u00a0and you didn't have\u00a0a toothache. This was communicated while you were at the clinic. But, you insisted that we re-do the filling.\n\nWe followed all protocols necessary to diagnose you and advise as we did.\n\nWith the current lockdown on essential services, filling / re-filling of the tooth is not considered an emergency\u00a0treatment but an elective treatment, and doing the\u00a0same would be a malpractice, subjecting the specialist to be penalised. Please do note that you have also signed a consent form saying that you have visited us only for an emergency treatment considering current pandemic.  It is indeed shocking to know that you had your teeth re-filled\u00a0from another dentist, which is against medical code. \u00a0\n\nAs a dental clinic, we give utmost care for our patients, and please note that\u00a0treatment regimen cannot be executed on directives\u00a0from the patient, on the basis of his/her instincts. We also would like to mention that you were asked not to pay the consultation fee, but you insisted and paid.\u00a0\n\nAs Doctors, we are trained to give our best for our patients\u2019 treatment, of which the prognosis is a scientific\u00a0approach based on logic, keeping in mind the patients' future health in\u00a0mind.\n\nWe always make sure to provide the most detailed examination and appropriate treatment to the best standard possible, with a whole overview approach to ensure long term dental health.\n\nTeam Credence",

Even the staffs were really gentle and humble.. overall found to be completely satisfied with my first choice of dentistry in RR Nagar. Would surely recommend it to my known ones.

After your visit, we have consulted with the Periodontal Specialist (screenshot attached) to decide the next course of action for your gum swellings. \n\nFurther to this, we have communicated the specialist opinion later during the evening on the same day(screenshot attached) and had a lengthy conversation about your gum condition and treatment (including the gel). During telephoning conversation, it was conveyed to you that the gum\u00a0issue if treated now would recur since you are undergoing orthodontic treatment. Which is the main reason that you were prescribed medications and asked for pre-medical tests.\n\nWe have noticed that in your review, you have mentioned that you did not receive treatment as you ask of us. Please note that we cannot prescribe treatment as suggested by the patient.\u00a0Our intent is to provide the right treatment to all our patients. It is not right on your part to force the line of treatment. We follow ethical practices and while doing so, our\u00a0main\u00a0intent is to treat the patient and not merely for monetary benefits and you should be appreciative that you benefited from this. If our intent was to make 'direct money', we wouldn't have been upfront with you as we did.\n\nWe are hopeful that your treatment goes well and you are relieved from your\u00a0agony. \n\nHowever, you are always welcome to reach out to us and we will treat you with your best interests in mind.\n\nTeam Credence",

I had a receeding gums problem because the lower tooth was in constant touch with upper cap. \nHowever, Doctor Pavan made me understand that there is a possibility of replacing the cap and make it not touch the lower tooth. And so, braces are not required.\nSo I went ahead with my treatment and got the caps replaced which matched almost 99% to my teeth colour and a thin one. I earlier had a bulky cap which protruded at the front. The entire process was very smooth and without any pain.\nAlso, they made multiple calls to check if everything is good during and after the treatment. \nI highly recommend Credence Dental and Dr.Pavan for all of your dental issues.",
