,,0,0,YES,"When writing a good review for a dentist, it's important to highlight your positive experiences and specific details that made your visit satisfactory. Here's an example of a good review:\n\n---\n\n\""I recently visited Dr. Bhavana dental office and had an outstanding experience Dr. Bhavana took the time to explain the procedure in detail, ensuring I felt comfortable and informed. The office was clean and equipped with the latest technology, which made the entire process smooth and efficient. I was particularly impressed with how gentle and thorough Dr. Bhavana was during the treatment. I highly recommend Dr. Bhavana to anyone looking for a compassionate and skilled dentist.\",2024-06-21 15:00:44,False,True,Paras Shrivastava,,,
,,0,0,YES," I stumbled into Dr. Bhavana for an emergency and it was the best accident ever. Dentists are a personal nightmare for me, but this one may have changed that. If there's a delay, she gives you a heads up so you're not waiting endlessly. She is kind, gentle, patient and brilliant at her job. So happy to have found my new permanent dentist here :) ",2024-05-30 17:50:10,False,True,Mohit Shahdadpuri,,,
