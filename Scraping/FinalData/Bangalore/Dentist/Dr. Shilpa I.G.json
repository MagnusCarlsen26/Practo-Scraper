Doctor\u2019s gentle and patient approach truly put my mother at ease, alleviating any dental anxiety she had. \n\nWhat sets Dr. Shilpa apart is her exceptional level of care and empathy for her patients. She went above and beyond to make my mother feel comfortable, taking the time to explain each step of the procedure in a way she could easily understand. Her gentle demeanor and reassuring nature created a trusting and supportive environment, which was invaluable to my mother's overall experience. The same great experience earlier also I had when Dr.Shilpa did dental care for my 5 yr old son.\n\nI must also commend the friendly and helpful staff at the clinic. The receptionists were welcoming and accommodating, ensuring smooth appointment scheduling and assisting with any administrative needs. \n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr.Shilpa for exceptional dental care, particularly for those seeking a compassionate and gentle approach. Dr. Shilpa\u2019s expertise, professionalism, and genuine care for their patients truly exceeded our expectations. My mother's and son\u2019s dental journey was made comfortable and stress-free, and we are grateful for the exceptional service we received. Thanks a lot, Dr. Shilpa.",

My kid was really very comfortable during her treatment and was well responding to suggestions from doctor. (I thought this would be the toughest part to get her treated for cavities and other issues ) Doctor explained the problem in much professional way and advised the various approaches to save my kids teeth. Doctor was very helpful in making me understand  overview of the problem and in choosing the right solution for my kid. The cleanliness and hygiene procedures adopted in the clinic are highly appreciable during this Covid19 pandemic situation.  UV Sterilization chamber takes care of their surgical equipment's for its hygiene and their staff was well trained in taking care of the treatment chair and other areas for its hygiene. Overall my daughter got the required treatment within time and it was a great experience overall. Once again A very BIG THANKS to doctor Shilpa for all her empathetic gestures and nice treatment to my kid. ",

Doctor\u2019s gentle and patient approach truly put my mother at ease, alleviating any dental anxiety she had. \n\nWhat sets Dr. Shilpa apart is her exceptional level of care and empathy for her patients. She went above and beyond to make my mother feel comfortable, taking the time to explain each step of the procedure in a way she could easily understand. Her gentle demeanor and reassuring nature created a trusting and supportive environment, which was invaluable to my mother's overall experience. The same great experience earlier also I had when Dr.Shilpa did dental care for my 5 yr old son.\n\nI must also commend the friendly and helpful staff at the clinic. The receptionists were welcoming and accommodating, ensuring smooth appointment scheduling and assisting with any administrative needs. \n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr.Shilpa for exceptional dental care, particularly for those seeking a compassionate and gentle approach. Dr. Shilpa\u2019s expertise, professionalism, and genuine care for their patients truly exceeded our expectations. My mother's and son\u2019s dental journey was made comfortable and stress-free, and we are grateful for the exceptional service we received. Thanks a lot, Dr. Shilpa.",

My kid was really very comfortable during her treatment and was well responding to suggestions from doctor. (I thought this would be the toughest part to get her treated for cavities and other issues ) Doctor explained the problem in much professional way and advised the various approaches to save my kids teeth. Doctor was very helpful in making me understand  overview of the problem and in choosing the right solution for my kid. The cleanliness and hygiene procedures adopted in the clinic are highly appreciable during this Covid19 pandemic situation.  UV Sterilization chamber takes care of their surgical equipment's for its hygiene and their staff was well trained in taking care of the treatment chair and other areas for its hygiene. Overall my daughter got the required treatment within time and it was a great experience overall. Once again A very BIG THANKS to doctor Shilpa for all her empathetic gestures and nice treatment to my kid. ",

I understand that delays can occur due to unforeseen circumstances, but the extended waiting period without any updates or communication was frustrating. It would be beneficial to streamline the scheduling process or implement better communication systems to ensure patients are informed of any delays and provided with estimated wait times.\n\nSecondly, I observed some issues with the receptionist\u2019s management of patients. The receptionist appeared overwhelmed and disorganized, leading to confusion and delays in the check-in process. There were instances where patients were left waiting for extended periods without any acknowledgment or guidance. Improving the receptionist\u2019s efficiency and communication skills would greatly enhance the overall patient experience.",

At the same time she is very kindly and have good sense of humour. Thank you Dr. Shilpa. Later for Wisdom tooth extraction, consulted Dr. Santosh. He is very professional and did Tooth extraction procedure smoothly. Did not realise when my tooth was out! His attention to minute details are very admirable. Explained the dos and don't nicely.
