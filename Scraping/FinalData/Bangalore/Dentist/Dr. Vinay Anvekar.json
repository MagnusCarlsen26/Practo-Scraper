However, they dismissed it as the cause of the pain, attributing it to high points)\nyou were already informed about the main reason for the persistent pain due to broken file .high point adjustment was just to make sure that excess pressure wasn't applied on the tooth .in your case even reduction was done to a point where there was no occlusion between tooth's .even after all this u weren't even ready to listen about the point regarding the broken file from the first .\n(as you mentioned They discovered a broken instrument inside and suggested informing the senior doctor )\nthe senior Dr was informed from day 1 itself but since u weren't ready for the procedure no appt was booked for the procedure .Eventually u visited the clinic and agreed for the procedure on which basis the Dr came and explained you everything and still didn't undergo the procedure citing some reasons and planned for the procedure next day for which u cancelled it .\nthe Dr had clearly mentioned everything since day 1 now if the patient is in denial mode nothing much we can do .you urself have agreed and stated that rerct wasn't needed on the first day .the topic of rerct had come because of updating you about the broken files .your own statements contradict you sir .\nyou have got a comprehensive 3D scan which was not all needed when the 2d RVG clearly shows the problem .but its your wish what u want to do we have no say in this matter .\n(as you mentioned clearly informed me that this could happen since I hadn't had the cap for some time and that the root canal could flare up at any time)\nthis was clearly informed to you in the first visit itself but since u had this thought no pain since 2 years why would it now and didn't want anything to be done except the crown .\nthe Dr also clearly informed you that after crown placement along with post the pressure would lead to pain eventually and u will need to undergo the procedures for which you said lets see when it happen .as I said we can only advise the patient and not force him . \n(as you mentioned  overhang portion in the crown that was installed, which explains the issue on day 6. Additionally, the crown was not properly contoured )\na crown never over hangs .its margins are extended if there is interdental bone loss if not there would be food impaction leading to gingivitis and re infection .if crown isn't contoured properly wouldn't have  fitted in the first place .\neven we do have the x rays after crown fixation where no issues are seen .\n(as you mentioned , I now have to remove it )\na very simple question to you sir \nif you had issues with the crown or with the fitting we were always ready to help you .you even had a warranty for 10 years and if you wanted for your convenience we would have gladly replaced the crown .\nwe contacted you also but u kept disconnecting the calls so we didn't want to bother you further .\n(as you mentioned  Composite material was placed between the teeth to adjust the overhang )\nplease understand the procedure done firstly before commenting .\ncomposite was done while post cementation before crown was fixed .during crown preparation all excess composite is trimmed to get the margins for the crown .then only is the crown cemented on the core structure .\nso please explain to us that how is it possible to place composite after crown was cemented onto the tooth surface .\nthe purpose of this detailed reply was for readers to know how treatments are planned and every detail is communicated with the patients from our side based on which the  correct procedure and proper treatment protocol is followed .\ndetailed consultation was done after the x-ray was taken and reviewed .each and every point was clearly mentioned to you .there was no rushing from our side from the start and after u said us to go ahead with the crown procedure bypassing the other mentioned procedures relying on the fact that since 2 years u had no pain.\nEven we have confidence that you will approach this reply in a positive manner and make efforts to understand the importance of correct diagnosis given by us  .\nRegards \nVinayaka Sai Dental",

                "review_text": "This is a continuation for the previously mentioned google review.\n\nThe essential point that both the clinic and everyone should understand is that a Google review is a platform for rating personal experiences and not a legal or medical authority for evaluating your practice. Each individual has the right to express their experience, and it is important to receive it positively rather than responding defensively by publicly displaying the patient's treatment procedure, which is not expected from a professional. It was hasty to immediately post the complete patient treatment procedure online in response to my review. As previously mentioned, since prompted by Google, I provided a rating based on my experience. My intention was to provide constructive feedback for the benefit of future patients and your practice. Unfortunately, it seems that my feedback was not received professionally. I am not discouraging others from visiting your clinic; it is their personal choice. However, since it seems acceptable to you to publicly post a patient's procedure, I feel compelled to share my detailed experience.\n\nTwo years ago, I had a root canal treatment (RCT). The tooth cap had been missing for the past 6-7 months, but I experienced no pain or discomfort. However, while chewing, the tooth broke due to the absence of a cap. Seeking a solution, I searched for a dentist on PRACTO, despite not experiencing any pain or discomfort at the time.\n\nDay 1: I met with a junior doctor who informed me that the tooth was broken and needed to have the broken piece removed. I inquired about getting a new cap, to which they took an X-ray and confirmed it was possible. However, the doctor did not mention any broken instrument inside the tooth. This point is important to note. The doctor was polite and explained the procedure but failed to mention the presence of a broken instrument. After confirming with the doctor that a re-root canal treatment (Re RCT) was not necessary, I agreed to proceed with the cap installation. Consequently, I promptly provided a positive rating on PRACTO since everything seemed fine, and they actively sought reviews.\n\nDay 6: I went for the cap fitting. Initially, the doctor mentioned that the cap wasn't fitting and attempted multiple times to adjust it. They even mentioned the possibility of redoing the procedure but eventually stated that it was fitting correctly. All the necessary adjustments were made, including correcting high points and performing a cleanup, which was satisfactory. The cap was installed, and the procedure was completed. The doctor assured me that everything went well and there would be no issues. Hence, I provided a positive rating on PRACTO.\n\nDay 21: Severe pain persisted, leading me to visit the doctor again. They took an X-ray, which I have a backup photo of, and mentioned the presence of something broken inside the tooth. However, they dismissed it as the cause of the pain, attributing it to high points. They rectified the high points, prescribed antibiotics, and sent me home.\n\nDay 24: The severe pain persisted, and a different doctor attended to me. They discovered a broken instrument inside and suggested informing the senior doctor. However, the senior doctor was absent from the clinic, so the X-ray photo was shared with him, indicating prior internal discussion. Suddenly, the senior doctor concluded that a surgery (Epicetomy) was necessary to remove the broken instrument. Since I had plans to leave town, I inquired if the procedure would address the problem. The doctor assured me that we could proceed immediately if needed and asked me to wait for his arrival. When the senior doctor arrived, he explained the Epicetomy procedure and emphasized that it was the only solution since the cap had already been installed. Despite the severity of the pain, a crucial conversation changed everything. I asked the doctor why the junior doctor hadn't mentioned the issue of the broken instrument earlier. The senior doctor's response was that sometimes broken pieces are left as they do not affect the procedure.\nTHIS REALIZATION HIT ME HARD. ***** ** *** ** ********** *** ******* ** ***** ****** ****** ** **** **** ** ******* the junior doctor should have clearly informed me about it on day 1 so I could make an informed decision. I did not desire a temporary solution; no one wants that. Consequently, I decided not to proceed with the procedure at that clinic.\nDue to the intense pain, I sought help from another clinic. They conducted a comprehensive 3D scan and X-ray, identifying all the issues and providing a thorough consultation on possible procedures. Based on the new reports, here are the major issues with the previous treatment:\n\n1.\tThe broken instrument issue was not communicated, ******** ******* **** ******** ******** ** ** ***** *** ** ********* ** *** ****. Sometimes, infections can be dormant and flare up due to biting force after installing new teeth crown. Regardless, they should have clearly informed me that this could happen since I hadn't had the cap for some time and that the root canal could flare up at any time. This information would have helped me make a better decision.\n2.\tThere is an overhang portion in the crown that was installed, which explains the issue on day 6. Additionally, the crown was not properly contoured. Consequently, I now have to remove it, ***** *** *** ***** ** **** *** *****.\n3.\tComposite material was placed between the teeth to adjust the overhang, *** ** ** *** ******** *** ********* *** ****** *** *** **** ** ***** ***********\n\nThis is my overall experience. Readers can review it and make their own decisions, being cautious when undergoing their own treatment procedures. Overall, the junior doctors were polite and doing their best, but the lack of detailed consultation and rushing into the treatment resulted in significant problems. A thorough consultation always helps patients to think and decide. I have confidence that you will approach this feedback in a positive manner and make efforts to enhance the patient experience.",

I met few doctor regarding this, everyone gave there openion but finally when met dr vinayaka sir, i satisfied with the procedure, he explained all the possible way in which we can resolve this diaestima, and let me decide which one i have to follow. Price was much less as compared to other clinic. He has completed my procedure in 2 week as he wanted my teeth to look natural and should not be uneasy for me, he only decided the colour and filling in between the teeth,  went slow with the procedure as how i was comfortable. Procedure required some petience but belive me u will not regret after this. He is very friendly, and will not make u feel like a patient, he treate patient like a family and so, he is very concerned about how the outcome will be and how much we can make it more beautiful. I had refer my friends also. I am very happy with the procedure no one can identify the difference that was all i needed. Thank you so much sir.",

Talking about the procedure of extraction, the procedure was very smooth, gave local anaesthesia inside my mouth and removed my Wisdom tooth without causing any pain. Also he explained me what and what not do post extraction for next 3 days. He has prescribed me antibiotics and pain killers to ease my pain for next 5 days. At last I can say I am fully satisfied with the treatment. Dr Vinay is very friendly to share the contact for any emergency. Talking about the clinic, there was very less waiting time and other staff members were very cooperative and polite. I would recommend others to visit Dr Vinay for any kind of dental problems. ",

He showed me pictures and suggested a excisional biopsy must be done at the earliest. I got it done on the same day and the surgery went very well, it was totally painless. The doctor was very careful while performing the surgery. Even after the surgery there wasn't any swelling or pain at all. I am really very happy with how Dr. Vinay handled the case with utmost care.

However, they dismissed it as the cause of the pain, attributing it to high points)\nyou were already informed about the main reason for the persistent pain due to broken file .high point adjustment was just to make sure that excess pressure wasn't applied on the tooth .in your case even reduction was done to a point where there was no occlusion between tooth's .even after all this u weren't even ready to listen about the point regarding the broken file from the first .\n(as you mentioned They discovered a broken instrument inside and suggested informing the senior doctor )\nthe senior Dr was informed from day 1 itself but since u weren't ready for the procedure no appt was booked for the procedure .Eventually u visited the clinic and agreed for the procedure on which basis the Dr came and explained you everything and still didn't undergo the procedure citing some reasons and planned for the procedure next day for which u cancelled it .\nthe Dr had clearly mentioned everything since day 1 now if the patient is in denial mode nothing much we can do .you urself have agreed and stated that rerct wasn't needed on the first day .the topic of rerct had come because of updating you about the broken files .your own statements contradict you sir .\nyou have got a comprehensive 3D scan which was not all needed when the 2d RVG clearly shows the problem .but its your wish what u want to do we have no say in this matter .\n(as you mentioned clearly informed me that this could happen since I hadn't had the cap for some time and that the root canal could flare up at any time)\nthis was clearly informed to you in the first visit itself but since u had this thought no pain since 2 years why would it now and didn't want anything to be done except the crown .\nthe Dr also clearly informed you that after crown placement along with post the pressure would lead to pain eventually and u will need to undergo the procedures for which you said lets see when it happen .as I said we can only advise the patient and not force him . \n(as you mentioned  overhang portion in the crown that was installed, which explains the issue on day 6. Additionally, the crown was not properly contoured )\na crown never over hangs .its margins are extended if there is interdental bone loss if not there would be food impaction leading to gingivitis and re infection .if crown isn't contoured properly wouldn't have  fitted in the first place .\neven we do have the x rays after crown fixation where no issues are seen .\n(as you mentioned , I now have to remove it )\na very simple question to you sir \nif you had issues with the crown or with the fitting we were always ready to help you .you even had a warranty for 10 years and if you wanted for your convenience we would have gladly replaced the crown .\nwe contacted you also but u kept disconnecting the calls so we didn't want to bother you further .\n(as you mentioned  Composite material was placed between the teeth to adjust the overhang )\nplease understand the procedure done firstly before commenting .\ncomposite was done while post cementation before crown was fixed .during crown preparation all excess composite is trimmed to get the margins for the crown .then only is the crown cemented on the core structure .\nso please explain to us that how is it possible to place composite after crown was cemented onto the tooth surface .\nthe purpose of this detailed reply was for readers to know how treatments are planned and every detail is communicated with the patients from our side based on which the  correct procedure and proper treatment protocol is followed .\ndetailed consultation was done after the x-ray was taken and reviewed .each and every point was clearly mentioned to you .there was no rushing from our side from the start and after u said us to go ahead with the crown procedure bypassing the other mentioned procedures relying on the fact that since 2 years u had no pain.\nEven we have confidence that you will approach this reply in a positive manner and make efforts to understand the importance of correct diagnosis given by us  .\nRegards \nVinayaka Sai Dental",

                "review_text": "This is a continuation for the previously mentioned google review.\n\nThe essential point that both the clinic and everyone should understand is that a Google review is a platform for rating personal experiences and not a legal or medical authority for evaluating your practice. Each individual has the right to express their experience, and it is important to receive it positively rather than responding defensively by publicly displaying the patient's treatment procedure, which is not expected from a professional. It was hasty to immediately post the complete patient treatment procedure online in response to my review. As previously mentioned, since prompted by Google, I provided a rating based on my experience. My intention was to provide constructive feedback for the benefit of future patients and your practice. Unfortunately, it seems that my feedback was not received professionally. I am not discouraging others from visiting your clinic; it is their personal choice. However, since it seems acceptable to you to publicly post a patient's procedure, I feel compelled to share my detailed experience.\n\nTwo years ago, I had a root canal treatment (RCT). The tooth cap had been missing for the past 6-7 months, but I experienced no pain or discomfort. However, while chewing, the tooth broke due to the absence of a cap. Seeking a solution, I searched for a dentist on PRACTO, despite not experiencing any pain or discomfort at the time.\n\nDay 1: I met with a junior doctor who informed me that the tooth was broken and needed to have the broken piece removed. I inquired about getting a new cap, to which they took an X-ray and confirmed it was possible. However, the doctor did not mention any broken instrument inside the tooth. This point is important to note. The doctor was polite and explained the procedure but failed to mention the presence of a broken instrument. After confirming with the doctor that a re-root canal treatment (Re RCT) was not necessary, I agreed to proceed with the cap installation. Consequently, I promptly provided a positive rating on PRACTO since everything seemed fine, and they actively sought reviews.\n\nDay 6: I went for the cap fitting. Initially, the doctor mentioned that the cap wasn't fitting and attempted multiple times to adjust it. They even mentioned the possibility of redoing the procedure but eventually stated that it was fitting correctly. All the necessary adjustments were made, including correcting high points and performing a cleanup, which was satisfactory. The cap was installed, and the procedure was completed. The doctor assured me that everything went well and there would be no issues. Hence, I provided a positive rating on PRACTO.\n\nDay 21: Severe pain persisted, leading me to visit the doctor again. They took an X-ray, which I have a backup photo of, and mentioned the presence of something broken inside the tooth. However, they dismissed it as the cause of the pain, attributing it to high points. They rectified the high points, prescribed antibiotics, and sent me home.\n\nDay 24: The severe pain persisted, and a different doctor attended to me. They discovered a broken instrument inside and suggested informing the senior doctor. However, the senior doctor was absent from the clinic, so the X-ray photo was shared with him, indicating prior internal discussion. Suddenly, the senior doctor concluded that a surgery (Epicetomy) was necessary to remove the broken instrument. Since I had plans to leave town, I inquired if the procedure would address the problem. The doctor assured me that we could proceed immediately if needed and asked me to wait for his arrival. When the senior doctor arrived, he explained the Epicetomy procedure and emphasized that it was the only solution since the cap had already been installed. Despite the severity of the pain, a crucial conversation changed everything. I asked the doctor why the junior doctor hadn't mentioned the issue of the broken instrument earlier. The senior doctor's response was that sometimes broken pieces are left as they do not affect the procedure.\nTHIS REALIZATION HIT ME HARD. ***** ** *** ** ********** *** ******* ** ***** ****** ****** ** **** **** ** ******* the junior doctor should have clearly informed me about it on day 1 so I could make an informed decision. I did not desire a temporary solution; no one wants that. Consequently, I decided not to proceed with the procedure at that clinic.\nDue to the intense pain, I sought help from another clinic. They conducted a comprehensive 3D scan and X-ray, identifying all the issues and providing a thorough consultation on possible procedures. Based on the new reports, here are the major issues with the previous treatment:\n\n1.\tThe broken instrument issue was not communicated, ******** ******* **** ******** ******** ** ** ***** *** ** ********* ** *** ****. Sometimes, infections can be dormant and flare up due to biting force after installing new teeth crown. Regardless, they should have clearly informed me that this could happen since I hadn't had the cap for some time and that the root canal could flare up at any time. This information would have helped me make a better decision.\n2.\tThere is an overhang portion in the crown that was installed, which explains the issue on day 6. Additionally, the crown was not properly contoured. Consequently, I now have to remove it, ***** *** *** ***** ** **** *** *****.\n3.\tComposite material was placed between the teeth to adjust the overhang, *** ** ** *** ******** *** ********* *** ****** *** *** **** ** ***** ***********\n\nThis is my overall experience. Readers can review it and make their own decisions, being cautious when undergoing their own treatment procedures. Overall, the junior doctors were polite and doing their best, but the lack of detailed consultation and rushing into the treatment resulted in significant problems. A thorough consultation always helps patients to think and decide. I have confidence that you will approach this feedback in a positive manner and make efforts to enhance the patient experience.",

Price was much less as compared to other clinic. He has completed my procedure in 2 week as he wanted my teeth to look natural and should not be uneasy for me, he only decided the colour and filling in between the teeth,  went slow with the procedure as how i was comfortable. Procedure required some petience but belive me u will not regret after this. He is very friendly, and will not make u feel like a patient, he treate patient like a family and so, he is very concerned about how the outcome will be and how much we can make it more beautiful. I had refer my friends also. I am very happy with the procedure no one can identify the difference that was all i needed. Thank you so much sir.",

Doctor has explained me well about my condition and asked for the extraction so that the tooth decay will not cause more pain and more infection to the other teeth. Talking about the procedure of extraction, the procedure was very smooth, gave local anaesthesia inside my mouth and removed my Wisdom tooth without causing any pain. Also he explained me what and what not do post extraction for next 3 days. He has prescribed me antibiotics and pain killers to ease my pain for next 5 days. At last I can say I am fully satisfied with the treatment. Dr Vinay is very friendly to share the contact for any emergency. Talking about the clinic, there was very less waiting time and other staff members were very cooperative and polite. I would recommend others to visit Dr Vinay for any kind of dental problems. ",

He showed me pictures and suggested a excisional biopsy must be done at the earliest. I got it done on the same day and the surgery went very well, it was totally painless. The doctor was very careful while performing the surgery. Even after the surgery there wasn't any swelling or pain at all. I am really very happy with how Dr. Vinay handled the case with utmost care.

I almost got a panic attack but somehow gathered courage to take out that tooth. I personally would say that Doctor was no less than God for me who, in no time, plucked out that demon tooth without much surgical equipment. I personally suggest all of you living in and around koramangala to visit Dr. Vinayak for any dental related issues. Thank you doctor.",

The analysis if the situation was correctly done and well explained to both of us. Highly recommended!!!",

I have this new found confidence all thanks to Dr. Vinay and Dr. Ashok! Thank you so much the both of you for being patient with me. I was so happy with the doctors I even got my mother from Pune, to get her treated for her teeth. We are both happy \ud83d\ude01",

Brcaes placed were not Correct and on what basis do you think we will do such baseless treatment so in the end you will have the say telling your the Dr why did you listen to patients .\nSuch Review dont matter to us or our patients who have Faith in our suggestion. \nIf u really want to save money and get things done underpar then better u should visit a dental college or some Govt hospital since we don't  charge unreasonably and for good material and service provided its does have a cost. \nWe do take negative reviews seriously but not at the cost that u expect us to treat you in unethical manner and as per your wish .\n\nRegards \nVinayaka sai dental clinic ",
