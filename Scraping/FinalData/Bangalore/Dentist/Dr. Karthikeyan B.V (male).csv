After the RCT procedure (took 4 sittings) and tooth filling in another tooth, I had to revisit the doctor in a week as the RCT tooth had formed a gap, as the crown was not properly fit. and the permanent filled tooth had come off in a week creating a hole.

During the RCT treatment, there were three patients awaiting for treatment. the doctor had to handle multiple patients at same time. **** ***** ***** **** ****** *** **** ***** ** ** *** **** ******** ** *** **** *** ***** ** *** **** *** *** ***** ******** **** *** *** ***** ******** ***** *** ******** *** ******* ***** **** ** *** ***** ******* ** ***** **** **** **** ** ** ***** ***** ** ** ******* ** *** ***** *** ******** ***** ** ******* *** *********** ************ ****** ****** *** ******* *** ******* *** **** ** *** ***** ******* ** *****  **** ** *** ******* *** ** ****** *** ******** ******** *** ***** **** *** **** ****** ****** *** *********
