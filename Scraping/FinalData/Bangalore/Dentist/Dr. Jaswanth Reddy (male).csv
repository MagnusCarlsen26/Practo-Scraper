"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,YES,"** ******** ***** ** ****** ** **** 

I did some R&D and found Jaswanth , on the very first day, the moment i talked to him in first 5 mins i decided to go with RCT as He is well versed in this area and seemed extremely calm while performing RCT.

Highly Experienced , I strongly recommend him for RCT.

High standards and world class treatment.

All the staff are very responsible.

As per my opinion, Please note pain is part and parcel of this treatment based on the case we have, so we cannot escape Karma(eg. why wisdom tooths,tooths problems only to some population) decide but Doctor like Jaswanth will do what ever possible to reduce our bad Karma :-)

hope the above feedback will help you little bit to consider doctor with out much hesitation.

Thank you SSR dental and special thanks to Dr Jaswanth reddy.

Thanks and Regards

I had gone for Root canal For 3 tooths . Doc Jaswant  explained the entire process and while taking each step he explained me in advance.
The best thing that I liked about this was that doctor followed up about my condition and well being! It personally adds a lot of care and warmth to your experience. Thanks a lot doctor! :)

Second thing receptionist is saying she will take the scan before doctor comes so that we can save time. Later she started treated me analysing the scan and telling me to go for extraction of teeth. Doctor did not come only then I demanded for doctor opinion later she called doctor finally he came.
