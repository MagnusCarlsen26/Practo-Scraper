She deals with patients as they are her own family members and she has mastered the art of dentistry as she holds the experience of decades in this profession.\n\nThere is very less wait time as the appointments are scheduled on mutual availability for every patienys.\n\nThe clinic is well equipped with all the advanced tools and machineries and she is very much conscious about the sanitation.\n\nThe best part (whatt i feel) is the costs for the treatment is comparatively lower to other dentists in this city. \n\nSo having said that i would personally recommend Dr. PRIYA to all the people out there,  just search on google,  get the direction n visit for any dental treatment.Its just opposite to Concorde Manhattan in Neeladri road. You can see the 'THE DENTIST' board over there..  \n\nn trust me, you will be reviewing the same way as im doing right now! Thats for sure :) kudos!! \n\nThankyou Dr Priya n hope you are doing good!!

We were finding it difficult to find the doctor address so we reached out to Practo to check on this and this was not my complaint. Today again we went to her with the physician report in the afternoon at 12 which was given to us 4 days back by Lal pathlab which we got done for the medical insurance and I asked her if she can check the same on mail and she told she don\u2019t hv any issue in checking that but then she requested us to come at 4 pm as she was busy with patients. \nWe went to see her at 4pm again and then she denied to check the report and we dont kn why.she \nalso asked me why i complained abt her to practo which i feel is nt the good way of interacting with patients and she asked me to contact practo and talk about this. She denied to check the reports which is fine bt then she cud hv told us the same in the afternoon. We had to spedn the timw uselessly so not the good experience with her",

She deals with patients as they are her own family members and she has mastered the art of dentistry as she holds the experience of decades in this profession.\n\nThere is very less wait time as the appointments are scheduled on mutual availability for every patienys.\n\nThe clinic is well equipped with all the advanced tools and machineries and she is very much conscious about the sanitation.\n\nThe best part (whatt i feel) is the costs for the treatment is comparatively lower to other dentists in this city. \n\nSo having said that i would personally recommend Dr. PRIYA to all the people out there,  just search on google,  get the direction n visit for any dental treatment.Its just opposite to Concorde Manhattan in Neeladri road. You can see the 'THE DENTIST' board over there..  \n\nn trust me, you will be reviewing the same way as im doing right now! Thats for sure :) kudos!! \n\nThankyou Dr Priya n hope you are doing good!!

After examining she informed that treatment to be followed which all went well. She suggested to consult physician before extraction of the wisdom tooth. Agreed. We were finding it difficult to find the doctor address so we reached out to Practo to check on this and this was not my complaint. Today again we went to her with the physician report in the afternoon at 12 which was given to us 4 days back by Lal pathlab which we got done for the medical insurance and I asked her if she can check the same on mail and she told she don\u2019t hv any issue in checking that but then she requested us to come at 4 pm as she was busy with patients. \nWe went to see her at 4pm again and then she denied to check the report and we dont kn why.she \nalso asked me why i complained abt her to practo which i feel is nt the good way of interacting with patients and she asked me to contact practo and talk about this. She denied to check the reports which is fine bt then she cud hv told us the same in the afternoon. We had to spedn the timw uselessly so not the good experience with her",

One tooth needed some filling too so she told me if it troubles more, I can come to see her for that. After a month, I called her if I can come for the filling but because the COVID cases were at rise she refused to see me then and asked me not to take risk by going out. And at that moment I felt so much gratitude for her.\n So my RCT started this month and to my surprise she didn't charge me any consultation fee saying that I paid in first visit. I really didn't expect that. The whole process went very smooth and I feel no trouble now.\n Dr. Priya is very polite and friendly. And the thing I like most about her is that she is very straightforward, gives right suggestions and is extremely helpful. I strongly recommend her to anyone with any dental issue. ",

Dr Priya treats all her patients with lot of care as if they are part of her own family. I had an issue where it was painful while getting the RCT Completed, she gave all her time to that. Called me up and gave her time on several sittings so that the pain subsides and I don\u2019t feel much pain. It\u2019s really a good gesture which is missing in the doctors nowadays who are just rushing behind money. Really appreciate. Looking forward to get my parents treated under her as well.",
