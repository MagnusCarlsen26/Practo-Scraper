"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Gap Closing,Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"I would like to express my deepest appreciation and gratitude for the remarkable care and exceptional treatment Dr. Tijo George provided to my niece. His expertise, patience, and compassionate approach have significantly impacted her dental health and overall well-being.
During our first visit to Dr. Tijo, we were deeply concerned about my niece's complex dental condition. Her teeth were crowded, and she still had many milk teeth in her upper and lower jaws. We had consulted with several other dentists in the past, but none of them were able to provide us with the same level of confidence and good treatment that Dr. Tijo George did. Thanks to his professional guidance and skillful interventions, my niece's dental condition has improved significantly. We are grateful for his help in transforming our worry into a better smile on my niece's face.
His ability to connect with patients personally is highly appreciated and played a significant role in her overall comfort and confidence. I wholeheartedly Thank Dr. Tijo Geroge and wish him great success in his future endeavors.  With his divine and healing treatment may he continue to bring smiles to countless.
