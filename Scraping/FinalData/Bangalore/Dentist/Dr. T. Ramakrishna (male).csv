 Doesn't explain the problem to the patient. Even after asking multiple times, he didn't give a proper budget and everytime went on adding few other procedures. 
There is no plan of action explained to the patient in written prior to doing any treatment. 
My father had to go for teeth extraction followed by a bridge. while i asked the doctor for the pricing he mentioned it to be 39k including extraction. My dad and husband also asked him about the pricing and he said the same. Later he charged for the extracted separately and said 39k was excluding the extraction. I'm wondering how can 3 people understand/ hear incorrectly!
 Extracted a tooth and left a part of the tooth inside. when i told the doctor about it, he said that was a bone. do you mean the jaw bone came out?
Everytime I had to remind him of the procedure that needed to be done as he didn't remember the case each time i went and rather suggested for additional procedures.
Doctor called for stitch removal and scaling. he removed the stitches and called me the next  day for scaling ( mostly he messed with his appointments and was getting late). Let me tell you I don't have all the time in the world to come to your clinic as and when you call when you cannot manage your own appointments well. I told him i cannot come again and so requested him to finish the scanning which he did then. 
Doctor doesnt't talk to the patient. Might talk to the attender. He instead has an assistant *** ******* **** **** *** ******* 
Bills - when you are taking the fees diligently then please also put the same effort to diligently send bills to the patient. Only after I requested for an ebill, was it given to me.

Lastly I chose to go to another doctor for rest of treatment *** *** ***** **** *** ********* ******

I have visited him couple of times for my dental issues but this time for my father's treatment it was a very bad experience hence would not recommend.
I really am not looking forward to any kind of explanation or excuses.

would appreciate, if Doctor could run through complexity of the procedure and the recovery stages and give adequate reason for advising the extraction would also be nice.
