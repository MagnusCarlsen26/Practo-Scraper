My wisdom tooth problem bothered me for a few years, but I was pretty scared of the operation. It worsened last month, so I finally decided to remove it. Dr Lahari ** *** **** ******* **** **** *** ** **** *** *** changed my perspective about this procedure! It was not as scary as I thought, and she completed the operation without me realising. The process was super quick and seamless due to her many years of experience. Highly recommend Dr Lahari  and Leo dental team doctor s if you are looking for a wisdom tooth removal.",

Having been back only yesterday since my last session, I was very impressed by the high levels of cleanliness and Covid19 safety practice and procedures for both patients and dentist alike. We are thoroughly protected throughout the session and there is huge attention given in detail to the cleaning of the treatment rooms. Also, the prices are always clear in advance so you understand what you are and aren't being charged for. I thoroughly recommend Leo Dental Clinic it gives 5 star service!\n",

Surgery was done by Dr. Kaushik Pai. Again he also patiently explained each step during the surgery, continuously asked if I am alright or feeling any discomfort. Surgery was done within half an hour for 2 wisdom tooth extraction and stitching. I was scared during the procedure but Dr. Kaushik helped me calm down and was gentle throughout. Post surgery Dr. Lahari is kind enough to provide extended support on Whatsapp and answer any questions I had. Overall they took good care of me and I recommend them for your dental problems. ",
