I was attended by Dr Taneya who helped me with veneers(some kind of cap) treatment. Once the treatment was done I was shocked , I couldn't believe how natural the treatment turned out. People now can't even make out it is cap. Super happy. \nHighly recommended \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d Kudos Dr Taneya good work.Super humble and good attitude.",
