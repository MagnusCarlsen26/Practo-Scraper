For which I greatly pay the price today by not going !\n\nCut a long story short I have been visiting Dr Priya Verma at the Smile Dental Clinic at Whitefield over the last six years now and my teeth are back on track ! \n\nFor a person who is extremely nervous ( to a large extent ) Dr Priya Verma is the most patient and reassuring dentist. The patient care factor takes top priority at the smile clinic which I feel is neglected at most other dentists that have sprung up. Every procedure is carefully explained in detail and a careful dental plan is then suggested with options given to the patient. During the procedure you are walked through a step by step guide as to what is happening . \n\nI recently had to undergo not one but two root canals which was my ultimate nightmare ! But I\u2019m glad to say that I finally did it with the care and expertise of Dr Priya Verma which actually promoted me to write a review ! Extremely happy with the whole dental plan and after care !\n\nHighly recommend Dr Priya Verma if you are nervous about your trips to the dentist and looking for great dental care ! \n",

You came with multiple missing teeth and some root canals which had been done ELSEWHERE. You wanted a fixed bridge on the right side and we did an X-ray and informed you that the root canal has not been done properly and after the bridge, there is a probability of infection.This was informed to you BEFORE doing any procedure. YOU INSISTED on proceeding with the bridge since you did not want implants on that side . You were well aware that the tooth under the bridge may develop infection and the same was CLEARLY CONVEYED to you.After the bridge,  you developed symptoms in that tooth. We told you there was an infection there and you needed to extract the tooth .\nWe gave you antibiotics for 1 week ( 6 days) to be precise!) . Can you please clarify where we told you to take antibiotics for 1 year! This is absolutely ridiculous. Is there a prescription you have for antibiotics FOR 1 YEAR???\nYou are having an issue with a treatment done elsewhere which you tried to blame on us.(You also gave a very unfavourable feedback of your previous dentist saying how badly the work was done!!) We have done due diligence and informed you prior to treatment about the risk of infection.You insisted on going forward with it  as you did not want to spend on implants. Yet when the infection happened you blamed us despite knowing that we had warned you about this earlier.",

We give a warranty for crowns for breakage or damage for 10 years and replace it free of cost in such cases. However if patients have eaten something sticky and the crown comes out that is not within our control. To fix the crown back we use various adhesive cements and depending on that there is a charge for fixing the crown back . If it has come out immediately after fixing then we do not charge, however your crown was fixed almost  in 2022! Hope you understand.",

Which clinic does not charge consultation charge please let us know! \nYou said you were in pain , and we examined you promising we will not hit the tooth at all. We understand you were very fearful but we  told you to at least open your mouth so we can examine. Eventually you opened and  you had multiple issues and we recommended an OPG X-ray which was done. Your teeth were not touched as you were in pain.You had to wait till the X-ray report was ready and we informed you that as well. However without talking to the staff or even paying your X-ray charges, you walked out. Our staff had to run after you to call you for taking your prescription and then you paid the X-ray charges of 650 and spoke very rudely saying you have paid the money.  \nYet we called you multiple times, shared your X-ray and prescription. Yes, your issue was not explained properly because your consultation was not complete. You left before meeting the doctor , without seeing your Xray report we could not have given you aany advise or a proper treatment plan.",

That moment itself i decided that she will be the only dentinst i gonna visit for my future needs too.\n\nGenerally i have seen my friends hating to go to dentist. And for me this was my first experience of RTC and i was extremely nervous.  But she comforted me so much before and during the RTC procedure that i did not even realize when it started and got over. The next sitting was for my dental filling and even that was so easy. It was over all a magical experience.\n\nYou hardly feel any pain or realize that there has been something done with ur teeth. Feels so normal. Even the filling is done so neatly that my mom was actually searching for which tooth its done. Such a neat work. \n\nAlso if you take appointment then there is hardly any wait time. \n\nThank You Doc. You are amazing. I recommend her 100%.",

She followed a proper approach to understand the issue that I was having (which was a severe tooth ache rising to the brain). She did a thorough examination and identified the root cause of the issue and explained to me exactly what was happening and how it got to this point.\nShe is extremely patient and gave the answers of all my concerns about the situation and how to proceed further. \nI was suggested to go for a tooth extraction which had decayed and was prescribed the right amount of medicines to help with the pain until the extraction date. \nThe tooth extraction was done on a set date and it was an unexpectedly awesome experience. She was constantly updating me on what they were performing and before I knew it, the procedure was done. \nI went home happy to be finally rid of the pain and waiting to get my hands on a cold bowl of ice cream.\nThanks Dr. Verma for making the whole process so smooth and comfortable.

For which I greatly pay the price today by not going !\n\nCut a long story short I have been visiting Dr Priya Verma at the Smile Dental Clinic at Whitefield over the last six years now and my teeth are back on track ! \n\nFor a person who is extremely nervous ( to a large extent ) Dr Priya Verma is the most patient and reassuring dentist. The patient care factor takes top priority at the smile clinic which I feel is neglected at most other dentists that have sprung up. Every procedure is carefully explained in detail and a careful dental plan is then suggested with options given to the patient. During the procedure you are walked through a step by step guide as to what is happening . \n\nI recently had to undergo not one but two root canals which was my ultimate nightmare ! But I\u2019m glad to say that I finally did it with the care and expertise of Dr Priya Verma which actually promoted me to write a review ! Extremely happy with the whole dental plan and after care !\n\nHighly recommend Dr Priya Verma if you are nervous about your trips to the dentist and looking for great dental care ! \n",

You came with multiple missing teeth and some root canals which had been done ELSEWHERE. You wanted a fixed bridge on the right side and we did an X-ray and informed you that the root canal has not been done properly and after the bridge, there is a probability of infection.This was informed to you BEFORE doing any procedure. YOU INSISTED on proceeding with the bridge since you did not want implants on that side . You were well aware that the tooth under the bridge may develop infection and the same was CLEARLY CONVEYED to you.After the bridge,  you developed symptoms in that tooth. We told you there was an infection there and you needed to extract the tooth .\nWe gave you antibiotics for 1 week ( 6 days) to be precise!) . Can you please clarify where we told you to take antibiotics for 1 year! This is absolutely ridiculous. Is there a prescription you have for antibiotics FOR 1 YEAR???\nYou are having an issue with a treatment done elsewhere which you tried to blame on us.(You also gave a very unfavourable feedback of your previous dentist saying how badly the work was done!!) We have done due diligence and informed you prior to treatment about the risk of infection.You insisted on going forward with it  as you did not want to spend on implants. Yet when the infection happened you blamed us despite knowing that we had warned you about this earlier.",

We give a warranty for crowns for breakage or damage for 10 years and replace it free of cost in such cases. However if patients have eaten something sticky and the crown comes out that is not within our control. To fix the crown back we use various adhesive cements and depending on that there is a charge for fixing the crown back . If it has come out immediately after fixing then we do not charge, however your crown was fixed almost  in 2022! Hope you understand.",

Which clinic does not charge consultation charge please let us know! \nYou said you were in pain , and we examined you promising we will not hit the tooth at all. We understand you were very fearful but we  told you to at least open your mouth so we can examine. Eventually you opened and  you had multiple issues and we recommended an OPG X-ray which was done. Your teeth were not touched as you were in pain.You had to wait till the X-ray report was ready and we informed you that as well. However without talking to the staff or even paying your X-ray charges, you walked out. Our staff had to run after you to call you for taking your prescription and then you paid the X-ray charges of 650 and spoke very rudely saying you have paid the money.  \nYet we called you multiple times, shared your X-ray and prescription. Yes, your issue was not explained properly because your consultation was not complete. You left before meeting the doctor , without seeing your Xray report we could not have given you aany advise or a proper treatment plan.",

That moment itself i decided that she will be the only dentinst i gonna visit for my future needs too.\n\nGenerally i have seen my friends hating to go to dentist. And for me this was my first experience of RTC and i was extremely nervous.  But she comforted me so much before and during the RTC procedure that i did not even realize when it started and got over. The next sitting was for my dental filling and even that was so easy. It was over all a magical experience.\n\nYou hardly feel any pain or realize that there has been something done with ur teeth. Feels so normal. Even the filling is done so neatly that my mom was actually searching for which tooth its done. Such a neat work. \n\nAlso if you take appointment then there is hardly any wait time. \n\nThank You Doc. You are amazing. I recommend her 100%.",

She did a thorough examination and identified the root cause of the issue and explained to me exactly what was happening and how it got to this point.\nShe is extremely patient and gave the answers of all my concerns about the situation and how to proceed further. \nI was suggested to go for a tooth extraction which had decayed and was prescribed the right amount of medicines to help with the pain until the extraction date. \nThe tooth extraction was done on a set date and it was an unexpectedly awesome experience. She was constantly updating me on what they were performing and before I knew it, the procedure was done. \nI went home happy to be finally rid of the pain and waiting to get my hands on a cold bowl of ice cream.\nThanks Dr. Verma for making the whole process so smooth and comfortable.

One tooth that had been badly infected had to be extracted. \nOver a period of 1.5 months over several sittings he was able to get all of this done successfully. He is now able to chew all types of food normally after several years of suffering from recurring dental problems. \nThe best part of the treatment:\n- he had to face minimal pain during the process. Even the surgery (tooth extraction) was relatively smooth and the pain was minimal. \n- at every stage of the treatment Dr. Priya gave a detailed explanation of the process, the alternatives and the pros and cons of each alternative. This enabled us to make an informed choice about the line of treatment to choose. \nI would like to thank Dr. Priya and her team for treating my father with minimal discomfort to him. ",

However, when we work on children the first and foremost thing on our mind is the safety of the child. We had already done a few of the child\u2019s fillings in the first sitting. The child attempted to close his mouth while the drill was working and that could have led to serious injuries in the mouth and cheek. For the CHILD\u2019S SAFETY it is in their best interest that we open their mouth at that time to prevent injuries which could result in cutting of the cheek or damage to the teeth inside. As we know that sometimes children can be uncooperative, that is why we were focusing on the most important fillings which if not done could cause pain in the near future. If the child is so uncooperative then the parents have to think of doing dental work under sedation in a hospital set up. However that carries its own risks and we were trying to make sure the important fillings of the child were completed without the parents having to go through with that.",

And patient has the option whether to take the treatment or not.  Our prices are in line  with our skill,  experience level of the doctors , the quality of our equipment and the high level of sterlization that we maintain. You were informed of the consultation charge as well as RCT charges prior to treatment . Consultation charges are a one time charge for all new patients and are not charged at every visit.\nOur policy regarding wait time is very clear .We see only with appointments. Patients in an emergency or severe pain are accomodated but that also not during pre fixed appointment times. However dental procedures can take time as we are dealing with the human body. If a patient inside the surgery is taking slightly more time,then a slightly longer waiting can happen. It is rarely more than 20-30 minutes. most patients understand that.\n\n The disposables are being used due to COVID precautions. We have to use a new PPE for each patient while doing aerosol work. Moreover the Root Canal needles used , even though sterlisable are not reused anymore, for safety of the patient as well as our staff. These cannot be compromised on for the safety of our patients as well as our staff.\n Root canal treatment can be painless or slightly painful depending on the condition of the tooth. Infected teeth can be slightly painful during treatment despite our best efforts. Pain can persist for a few days but is controlled if you follow instructions and take your medication properly. Moreover pain perception varies from patient to patient.\n  We are working under conditions where all of us are wearing PPE , face shields and since doctors are wearing Full face Respirators our staff is unable to hear us when we talk. We have to speak louder for them to follow instructions. Since we are right next to the patient it is of course a little louder! In case we need materials during treatment we cannot remove the respirators and PPE kits. We have no option but to talk louder so as to give instructions.",

No patient is checked without a fresh PPE kit and we carry out all the sanitisation procedures recommended after every single patient.  That in fact can lead to some delay. A patient already in the dental chair cannot be told to go out if there is a pain case waiting outside . Most importantly, I would like to point out that we are not an IT or service industry where SOP applies. In healthcare we deal with Human Beings. That is the  critical  difference. For example, a root canal treatment may take 30-45 mins . However in  certain cases it may take 1-2 hours also. These are unforseen one offs but they happen as we deal with people and not machines. Every patient is unique and requires treatment accordingly. Though we plan our time slots carefully, sometimes delays are possible. Rest assured when it is your turn,we will give you our full attention with complete dedication.We could prescribe an oral painkiller if the patient in the waiting area  is in too much pain. However a surgical procedure that is continuing cannot be stopped in the middle and most patients understand that. We cannot run out in our PPE kits to inform or take care of a patient in pain. As we are wearing respirators during working, we take a little time between patients. Although we have multiple dental chairs ,Only one patient is taken in the surgery at a time for safety precautions and we have to sanitise before taking you in. If that leads to delay it cannot be helped as it is the safety protocol.We do not see walk in patients so there is no question of seeing a non appointment patient before you. However there are times when a patient may come early or late leading to more patients. Our waiting and consultation areas are large enough to allow safe distancing.\nHope you can understand that we are working under these  constraints  and strive to take care of our patients to the best of our ability.",

PPE is used for the doctor and assistants for your protection , it is used and discarded appropriately as per safety protocol after every patient and cannot be \u201c given\u201d to the patient. How can used and contaminated kits given back? They are disposed as hazardous biological waste.Receipt is provided to the patient for the entire charges paid by the patient including PPE kit. Usually it is sent on email and hard copy is provided if the patient asks for it. All doctors and assistants are wearing full PPE kit with N95 masks, face shield, head cap and gloves, changed after each patient and  the surgery is sanitised. Our staff is never in the clinic without wearing appropriate protection. We have to sanitize the clinic after each patient for the safety of our patients and our staff. Moreover though we have multiple chairs , we are now taking in only one patient at a time keeping in mind the safety of our patients. Everything used for each patient is new and disposed off after use. Instruments to be sterlised now undergo 3 levels of sterlization. That does involve extra expenditure which is borne partly by us and a small cost is passed on to the patient. Besides the consultation is a one time charge for new patients. All patients are informed of all charges PRIOR to the appointment .",
