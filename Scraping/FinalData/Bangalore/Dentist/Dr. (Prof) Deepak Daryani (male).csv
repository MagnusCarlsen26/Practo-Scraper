The aspect that I found disappointing was the discussion about the cost of the extraction procedure. Initially, Doctor Roy informed me that if I opted for a specialized dentist, the charge would be 6000/-. However, if I chose to have the extraction performed by the in-house doctors, the cost would be 3500/-. This seemed like a reasonable difference in price.

To my surprise, when Doctor Deepak joined the conversation, he contradicted Doctor Roy's statement.
