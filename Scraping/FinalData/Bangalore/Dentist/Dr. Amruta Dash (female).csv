Initially I was very skeptical but after meeting her and after completion of my treatment I have full confidence on her and Ivorysmiles. I got 3 root canals and 4 crowns done. They plan the treatment very well which I think is lacking in most dentists. They give a complete picture of dental issues and what are the steps required. They are so clear in what they explain and treatment is also done according. I had really bad experiences with other dentists but after meeting her I have decided not to change my dentist for ever. She is very sweet humble and the people in her clinic are also very nice. Not behind money at all. ,2021-09-19 07:02:08,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
