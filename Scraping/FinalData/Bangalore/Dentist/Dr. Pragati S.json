I was initially hesitant to have the procedure done, but Dr. Pragati put me at ease with her reassuring demeanor and thorough explanations. She also took the time to answer all of my questions, which helped me to feel confident in my decision.The surgery went smoothly, and  I experienced some soreness and swelling in the days following the procedure, but Dr. had prescribed medication to help me manage the discomfort. I was also given detailed instructions on how to care for my implants, and I followed them carefully. Doctor also helped me with replacing dentures that was broken. After 2.5 months, the final  crown was placed They fit perfectly, and I am so happy with the results. I would highly recommend Dr. Pragati to anyone who is considering having dental implants. I am so grateful for her expertise and compassion, and I would not hesitate to see her again in the future.",

She also took the time to answer all of my questions, which helped me to feel confident in my decision.The surgery went smoothly, and  I experienced some soreness and swelling in the days following the procedure, but Dr. had prescribed medication to help me manage the discomfort. I was also given detailed instructions on how to care for my implants, and I followed them carefully. Doctor also helped me with replacing dentures that was broken. After 2.5 months, the final  crown was placed They fit perfectly, and I am so happy with the results. I would highly recommend Dr. Pragati to anyone who is considering having dental implants. I am so grateful for her expertise and compassion, and I would not hesitate to see her again in the future.",
