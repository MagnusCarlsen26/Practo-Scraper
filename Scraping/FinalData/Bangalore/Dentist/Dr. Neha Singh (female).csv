"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Misaligned Teeth,Metal Braces Fixing,",0,0,YES,"A Smile to Cherish: Dr. Neha's Expertise in Orthodontics

From the moment we stepped into Small Bites, Domlur clinic,  we knew we were in capable hands. The ambiance was calming and kid friendly, and the staff greeted me with warm smiles that set a positive tone for my daughter's treatment journey. Trust me you get everything under one roof. 

We first met Dr Premila Naidu for my daughter teeth issues and she was perfect in explaining what we need to do, what can be done, how the process works  etc. She put us through Dr Neha Singh for further treatment since this needed orthodontist magic.

Dr. Neha is not just a dental doctor; she is an artist and a perfectionist. Her approach to fixing braces is meticulous, throughout the process, she explained each step with clarity, making sure we understood the importance of each phase of my daughter's treatment.

The outcome? Nothing short of miraculous. After her braces were removed, we were greeted by a reflection that beamed back a perfectly aligned set of teeth. The transformation was not just physical; its much beyond. She can now smile without hesitation, and it's all thanks to Dr. Neha's exceptional skill and dedication. Her expertise in orthodontics has given us a great outcome that we will treasure for a lifetime. For anyone considering braces, I cannot recommend Dr. Neha & Small bites enough.
