I wasn't much aware then so after 11 years the filling started breaking and causing pain. So I went to Dr Shilpa after seeing good reviews. She explained the problem well and told me I have 2 options, either to put a temporary cap followed by a permanent cap or to do a reroot canal to make sure no infection is there. I opted for the reroot canal followed by cap placement (zirconia) which took 4 sittings and the last sitting she explained that 3 teeth need tooth filling and did a dental cleaning for free. All over I am happy about the procedure done. It has been more than a week since I put the cap and it's not caused any problems. Dr Shilpa has also told me to be free to come to her anytime I have problems with the cap.",

She was precise with her instructions about care and clearly outlined the steps she would take and the risk that might be involved with the treatment. She also didn't make any unnecessary comments about me having to do root-canals and scaling treatment on this and that tooth which also was a first. The caps she replaced actually fit better than one put in previously. She was also really helpful even though i was a walk patient.\r\n",
