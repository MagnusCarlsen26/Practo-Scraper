Whereas before SLV Dental - I had gone to a couple of places (the most popular ones in Bangalore - you can guess). And those other places told it's a cavity and needs RCT and capping treatment. Hence, a big factor - trust - is something you will find with Dr. Abhisheak.\n\nApart from this - I had been a having a tooth cavity and decayed wisdom tooth in the other areas. I had been delaying my treatment for quite sometime. I decided to get both things done by Dr. Abhisheak. It was a seamless and professional process. And after the treatment, Dr. Abhisheak used to regularly follow up to do a quick check-in on my status. Sometimes when I felt over-bearing pain - he was available for quick checkin on WhatsApp. I really liked this - because the treatment does not end with the procedure - there is a lot of post-procedure care needed. This is mostly not available in other places.\n\nThus, I had an overall outstanding experience with Dr. Abhisheak and SLV Dental. Biggest factors for me - trust, right diagnosis, seamless and professional, friendliness and post-procedure quick checkins.",

Whereas before SLV Dental - I had gone to a couple of places (the most popular ones in Bangalore - you can guess). And those other places told it's a cavity and needs RCT and capping treatment. Hence, a big factor - trust - is something you will find with Dr. Abhisheak.\n\nApart from this - I had been a having a tooth cavity and decayed wisdom tooth in the other areas. I had been delaying my treatment for quite sometime. I decided to get both things done by Dr. Abhisheak. It was a seamless and professional process. And after the treatment, Dr. Abhisheak used to regularly follow up to do a quick check-in on my status. Sometimes when I felt over-bearing pain - he was available for quick checkin on WhatsApp. I really liked this - because the treatment does not end with the procedure - there is a lot of post-procedure care needed. This is mostly not available in other places.\n\nThus, I had an overall outstanding experience with Dr. Abhisheak and SLV Dental. Biggest factors for me - trust, right diagnosis, seamless and professional, friendliness and post-procedure quick checkins.",

Doctor first explained the cause and diagnosis in detail and further guided me on the measures that would follow. This really helped me understand the procedures which were to be undertaken and I must admit that it was very reassuring. I never had to wait for long to seek consultation and my week long treatment couldn\u2019t have been any more hassle free. What I appreciated the most was the friendly and cordial atmosphere which the doctor creates for all his patients, which I gathered during my multiple visits. Duly following up on my progress and well-being was also very reassuring. It would not be an exaggeration if I say that this was my best experience so far! \n\nA big thank you to Dr. Abhisheak and his team who helped me greatly!! Highly recommended. ",

Xray was taken of the affected area. Surprisingly it was the lower wisdom tooth decay causing the pain.I was advised to remove the tooth and given a choice of date and time. To relieve the pain antibiotics and pain killers were prescribed.On the appointment date, surgeon turned up and performed the extraction. It was 15 minutes process to be exact including anesthesia.Post care procedures were clearly mentioned and written instructions given.Dr is very friendly and followed up with me daily on the phone. Constantly giving relevant advice and procedures to be followed.10/10 I would recommend the Dr. Naik. ",

                "review_text": "My partner had a bad toothache and we chose to check up with Dr.Abhishek at SLB Dental, Harlur. Dr Abhishek did a detailed checkup and scan of the aching jaw. He made a hypothesis regarding the condition of gum inflamation above the wisdom tooth and confirmed the same using physical checks and scans. He showed us on the scan, the exact area affected.\nPost doing a clean up of the affected area, he gave different possible options for treating the same. Besides, he advised us to get a night guard to address the condition of night grinding. He shared with us detailed explanation regarding the nature and implications of night grinding. It was great consulting him.\n\nAnother friend of mine got infection in her tooth which already had a filling and was facing tooth pain. I advised her to check it up at SLV Dental. Based on inhouse mini xray, doctor Abhishek described to her the position and extent of inflamation and how it is important to get it cleared. He proactively guided her through the process and implications. She had her root canal and filling completed and is doing fine now.\n\nBoth me and my partner also had a dental clean up done by him which was thorough.\n\nI found Dr.Abhishek to be a emphathetic, ************* *** friendly doctor. I will visit him again for any doubts and dental conditions. Thanks doctor!",

The doctor explained that it's possible to protect and repair the tooth, and the implications of extraction - and gave us the option to decide what we want to do. Based on the unless, we decide to go with Root Canal as suggested by the doctor.It was a completely painless exercise. The doctor was very careful and did the procedure in multiple settings. My mom used to have pain in the teeth frequently and used to struggle to eat anything which isn't soft. Though after the root canal, she never complained about any pain and can now eat anything easily. Very thankful to the doctor and would highly recommend him.",

Dr. Abhishek Naik\u00a0 delivers a level of care and expertise to his clients. He is a perfectionist who makes you feel more like a relative seating in his chair than simply another patient. Thats why I trusted him to do dental procedures for me. He talks to you and explains exactly what you need and what happens if you do not do anything about it. Going to a dentist may be frustrating but he make you comfortable. He has great support staff and reasonable prices. I highly recommend to everyone. Keep up good work..!!",

Got total 7 tooth built out from this clinic didn't have any trouble so far. Though u need to maintain by following simple steps. He is also cost effective and available over what'sapp to coordinate.

His way of talking gets you in confidence and his proactive approach of scheduling sessions basis your feasibility gives you an advantage of flexibility. His price is also best and competitive. We are from Delhi but there was no language bar amongst us and he felt family from day first it self. I highly recommend Dr Abhishek for a visit after that you your self will find it worth.",

We can easily discuss the problem with him and he would provide the right explanation, treatment and after care. In my case, I had 2 root canals done barely 10 days before my wedding, and doctor ensured the root canals were done clearly, and Zirconia caps fitted and ready. Please note couple of the crowns were on the front side, and doctor took utmost care with the lab technicians to ensure the color matches with the other teeth, especially because they were front teeth. Thanks to Dr. Abhisheak I was able to smile sparkling for all my wedding pictures :). More importantly, the nagging teeth issue (and headaches) I had are completely gone now. I will definitely recommend Dr. Abhisheak to all my friends and family!",

Overall without any major issues and challenges with basic medication he avoided root canal or tooth removal for my mother. She is relieved of the pain now.

It was a long pending procedure for past few years as I was bit apprehensive about the outcome.  However, Dr. Abhishek did a nice job to get me a nice bridge which allowed my left side of the teeth to function normally. He did multiple follow ups over the call and texts during the month long procedure. Thank you Dr. Abhi.",

Dr vivek too for some help with the treatment and especially towards the end after the braces were removed. \nGreat place, staff and and reasonable price to the patient above everything. Even got my younger sister to start her orthodontic treatment here. :)",
