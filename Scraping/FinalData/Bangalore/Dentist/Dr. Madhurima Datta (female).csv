,,0,0,YES,"I strongly recommend Dr.Madhurima Datta for the dental treatments..
I have experienced the best of best practices from her, she is so polite and gentle to the patients and explains about the problem and solution to it in detail...

Consoling words is what all the patients required when in pain...that i got from her.

Thank you doctorðŸ˜Š
