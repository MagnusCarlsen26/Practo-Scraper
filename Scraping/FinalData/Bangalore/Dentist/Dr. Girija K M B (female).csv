"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Fillings,Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,YES,"I had been to the clinic for an tooth issue. Dr. Girija ( Senior well experienced doctor) explained me that the tooth needs immediate attention and RCT has to be performed on it. Later, she also suggested that lot of other tooths are having gaps, decay and cavities. Advised me to do cleaning and fillings. I was so convinced that i underwent all the treatment and fillings. Now I feel totally a different experience. I realised that, I was living with dental issues from quite long time. 
The clinic ambience is good, not too crowded so that we have to wait long time. The hospitality of other doctors and staffs are very good and they treat, greet patients well. 
Overall I like it. I would definitely recommend this clinic for any kind of dental issues.
