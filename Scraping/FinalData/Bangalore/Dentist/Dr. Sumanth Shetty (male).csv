We had already done a full mouth x-ray for my son. After checking my son and the full mouth x-ray, doctor Sumanth Shetty told that my son need to undergoe root canal operation(RCT) at that teeth. Except that he need to undergoe deep cleaning in one of lower teeth at the left side and cleaning and filling for the 4 teeths(2 upper and 2 lower) at the right side of the mouth where he didn't have any pain. We asked doctor Sumanth Shetty that we want to go for treatment only for the teeth where my son is having pain. But ******** *** doctor Sumnath shetty convinced us that he would do all the operations(RCT in 1 teeth, deep cleaning in 1 teeth, cleaning and filling in 4 teeths) in single sitting within 20 minutes. We were worried about it. But he convinced that we need not worry about it . So the very next day(22nd january, 2021) my son went through all the operations. The doctor Sumanath shetty finished it within 20 minutes. We asked Sumanath Shetty whether everything was done properly. The doctor Sumanath Shetty told us that everything is fine. Then Sumanath Shetty told us that there will be pain for 5-7 days more. Sumanath Shetty suggested antibiotic for next 3 days and pain killer SOS. *** **** ***** * ***** ** *** ****** ******* **** ***** **** ** *** ****** ** *** *** **** ** we booked another appointment on 27th january 2021 with doctor Sumanath Shetty. On that day Sumanath Shetty told that probably the crown that was not placed properly during RCT as my son was not co-operating(my son is just 3 years of old. he doesn't understand what is going with him. So he cried a lot). So Sumanath Shetty told that the teeth where he had undergone RCT need to be extracted. Since there were no other way so we accepted it. The teeth was extracted by doctor Sumanth Shetty and Sumanth Shetty told that my son would be fine in next few days. *** **** ******* ** *** ***** ***** ** *** ***** **** ***** ******** *** ******* **** ***** **** *********** ***** **** ** **** ** ***** ****** **** ** ******* ** *** ****** ******* ****** *** *** ***** ***** *** ***** *** ******** *** ******* *** **** ******** Today we called to the clinic and cancelled the follow up check up that was scheduled this week. After that I found that in all the previous appointments(21st jan, 22nd jan and 27th jan), the name of doctor Sumanth Shetty was replaced by Dr Mayori Doley in the practo. We don't know how it is possible. *** ** ** * ***** **** ** ********* ********* They want to defend doctor Dr Sumanth Shetty from negative review. I strictly not recommend doctor Sumanth Shetty to anyone.",2021-02-02 11:12:57,False,False,Verified Patient,"Hi Mr ; I generally don’t reply for the reviews; positive or negative at this stage of my profession. However; this blatant misrepresentations of the facts in this case from your side has pushed me to reply to the same. Please note the following points and hope you also self-evaluate:
a)	Both of Us are very well aware that this was a case to be done under General anesthesia due to multiple deep cavities and you already did have 2 similar opinions about the same. The first time Antibiotics and pain killer were given and treatment was not done on your first visit.
b)	Unlike you are putting across; you also know there is no full mouth x-ray for the child and in the clinic we had tried for more than half hour to get the OPG  xray done in the first visit which was not possible as the child was un-cooperative and only around 3 yrs old. So being dependant only on your subjective symptoms and insistence that the child has pain only in the lower teeth; your treatment plan was given on first day.
c)	Since you hadn’t opted for Gen anesthesia till then and wanted to avoid it; seeing the plight of the mother and the child with unbearable pain i could not refuse to do the case the next appt morning. It is only because of the experience in years and our MDS degree training in paediatric dentistry that we could complete the case in 30 mins with the help of 3-4 assistants and requesting all the other patients to wait as we gave priority to the child. It is definitely not for the 2500rs we charge for a kids root canal...
d)	After 3 days; you came again and were very specific that the pain is in that RCT treated tooth only. On checking for symptoms and any tenderness on tapping on the tooth i had clearly told that; that tooth is fine and the problem could be because of the other deep cavities. As he was not co-operating for the xray scan on that day also; on your insistence and consent we had to remove that tooth and we had a recall appt. After 2 days on Wednesday.
e)	You did call up on Tuesday; which is our weekly off; and spoke to the staff that child is still having pain and so you want to cancel all appointments. At the time you accepted that as the pain is in upper tooth now and that you did not anticipate while removing the lower tooth that the pain could have been in the other tooth also. If you would have been a little patient to accept our diagnosis that day and been under observation instead of removing that tooth; better treatment would have been possible for that child. It is clear now that only after removing did you acknowledge that it didn’t occur to you that pain could be in another tooth which was the actual case. As instead of working together to help the child you were focussed on blaming the procedure done and on removing that tooth as the solution to your issue.
  Where is the justification for this entire episode created;and an experience i haven’t come across in the 20years of my profession;and pls understand we also without proper xrays for these small kids we are purely dependant on signs and subjective symptoms from parents and good parent attitude is definitely a boon.Anyways;wish you all the best for your future treatments.

As your complaint was pertaining to wisdom tooth; X ray is mandatory to give an informed consult. Only in elective treatments like a regular scaling or an old patient whose earlier Digital  x ray record is with us do we not recommend X ray. Secondly; at a consult we do a complete evaluation and not just what the patient sees as then there would be no justification to the consult and our records also show the entire treatment required.However; if we have not met your expectations we will definitely look at how to improve ourselves which is a constant endeavor even if its 20yrs in this field. You do have cavities on both sides and wisdom tooth on both sides.
Finally;each of Us have a set point of view and are entitled to the same-while we respect your view that the Senior Dr should see you 1st;our experience over the years and patients feedback has been that a resident dentist making a note of the history and clinical findings and taking an xray helps the Senior Dr to co relate all of the same and when he sees the patient he can give a definitive diagnosis and solution than guess work or Provisional Diagnosis and he gets the time to collate all of these BEFORE seeing the patient and then co relate.
  Due to the Pandemic;we do not wish to put the patient on chair unless really required a second time and definitely not for a wisdom tooth issue where we know the treatment is removal! Hope this clarifies the issue for you as your chief complaint shows pain in lower last tooth region and your file says removal of wisdom teeth and 2 small fillings ...
