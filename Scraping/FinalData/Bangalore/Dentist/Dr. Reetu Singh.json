The problem of my tooth pain was intricate and not detectable externally.  How ever I was referred to this doctor by some of my colleagues. It was really great thing that the doctors professionalism was extraordinary and she narrowed down on the perfect treatment. She advised me of the present position and as well appraised of the post treatment. She did take more than 04 sitting\u2019s but the treatment was absolutely superb.  The charges made too were very nominal. The doctor was also very prompt on the time schedule. It was very wonderful. Great professionalism. Recommend for others too. May be it will be of help for some one.  With best wishes to all. \n\nAlso I should make one more mention.  My front teeth had a gap which was preventing me from going for a grand smile. The doctor has done very wonderful gap filling and the teeth is looking natural and glittering. This aspect was superb. I am sure ladies will feel elated about this. \nI strongly recommend this doctor for beatifying pearls also.\nDr. Sudhamani \nScientist \n",

The problem of my tooth pain was intricate and not detectable externally.  How ever I was referred to this doctor by some of my colleagues. It was really great thing that the doctors professionalism was extraordinary and she narrowed down on the perfect treatment. She advised me of the present position and as well appraised of the post treatment. She did take more than 04 sitting\u2019s but the treatment was absolutely superb.  The charges made too were very nominal. The doctor was also very prompt on the time schedule. It was very wonderful. Great professionalism. Recommend for others too. May be it will be of help for some one.  With best wishes to all. \n\nAlso I should make one more mention.  My front teeth had a gap which was preventing me from going for a grand smile. The doctor has done very wonderful gap filling and the teeth is looking natural and glittering. This aspect was superb. I am sure ladies will feel elated about this. \nI strongly recommend this doctor for beatifying pearls also.\nDr. Sudhamani \nScientist \n",
