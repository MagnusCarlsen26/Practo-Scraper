Dr Poorvi was so helpful listened patiently and explained every step during the treatment, she responded to all my queries even on WhatsApp, all thanks to her all my fears of reaching to a dentist and sitting on that chair have flown away.

My Fiance is a Doctor in UK, he is well known about my cavity . Seeing Dr. Poorvi's profile, my Fiance suggested to consult her. During my visit,  i found she is very polite and friendly. She advised me to go for good filling as the cavity was very small and no major issue in teeth.  I found the treatment very satisfactory as well.

My Fiance is a Doctor in UK, he is well known about my cavity . Seeing Dr. Poorvi's profile, my Fiance suggested to consult her. During my visit,  i found she is very polite and friendly. She advised me to go for good filling as the cavity was very small and no major issue in teeth.  I found the treatment very satisfactory as well. So leaving here a good feedback  for her :) I will recommend .",
