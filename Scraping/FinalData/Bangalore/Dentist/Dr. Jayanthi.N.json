Through out the course they make the patient comfortable. Best part is the way they are prepared and taking care of the safety measures towards covid.  Hygiene is commendable. Even the front office staffs are polite and will guide u very well. One of the best clinic I have seen.  Cost wise no comments... When we get the best and it is fruitful cost becomes secondary..

She takes utmost care to ensure that we have a painless procedure. I had a tooth fracture in upper left canine tooth. I am feeling fine, post Root Canal and permanent filing. A ceramic crown would be placed on the canine tooth to give it the look as it was before.\nI would like to tell all that our teeth are a vital part of our body, please don't try to become a doctor yourself, if you have any problem, do visit doctor, and don't hesitate or doubt to follow their instructions or procedures they recommend. It's for our long term benefits.\nThank you Jayanthi mam.\nBest wishes and Regards\nAbhijeet Singh Arora",

Explained everything clearly with proper x-ray and what has to be done. Got one premolar removed and placed with ZIRCONIA bridge along with RCT as the tooth adjacent to it were decayed. Some teeth needed fillings and de-scaling has been done. I personally want to thank Dr.Jayanti,Dr.Cavya,Dr.Harikeerthy,Dr.Altaf. All of them attended me with great care and the process was smooth and painless. Regarding the pricing it was minimal and reasonable. No hidden or exhorbiant prices charged. I'm very much satisfied with the treatment. All the doctors were impeccable and friendly. Highly recommend this clinic. Moreover you won't feel you were at a clinic. Clinic was well maintained and hygienic. Thank you for treating me with great care. Hope this review might help others seeking for a good oral care. ",

Through out the course they make the patient comfortable. Best part is the way they are prepared and taking care of the safety measures towards covid.  Hygiene is commendable. Even the front office staffs are polite and will guide u very well. One of the best clinic I have seen.  Cost wise no comments... When we get the best and it is fruitful cost becomes secondary..

Explained everything clearly with proper x-ray and what has to be done. Got one premolar removed and placed with ZIRCONIA bridge along with RCT as the tooth adjacent to it were decayed. Some teeth needed fillings and de-scaling has been done. I personally want to thank Dr.Jayanti,Dr.Cavya,Dr.Harikeerthy,Dr.Altaf. All of them attended me with great care and the process was smooth and painless. Regarding the pricing it was minimal and reasonable. No hidden or exhorbiant prices charged. I'm very much satisfied with the treatment. All the doctors were impeccable and friendly. Highly recommend this clinic. Moreover you won't feel you were at a clinic. Clinic was well maintained and hygienic. Thank you for treating me with great care. Hope this review might help others seeking for a good oral care. ",

I think you also agreed upon this on the telephonic conversation we had.\n\n3. We have no customers in our clinic .
