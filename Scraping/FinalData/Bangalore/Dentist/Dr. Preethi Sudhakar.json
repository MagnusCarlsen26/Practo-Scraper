I was happy to note that the clinic had all in house facilities and after scanning I got to know that one tooth was decayed. Dr Preethi explained to me that the tooth would require filling after removal of the decayed area of the tooth after which a customised crown would be placed to blend with the other teeth. I was really scared since this was my first visit, however the team handled the situation with utmost patience, especially Dr. Preethi  did the procedure with so much dedication that I felt that I have to convey this to other people like me. I take this as an opportunity to tell you that you also can get a similar experience on visiting her clinic. ",
