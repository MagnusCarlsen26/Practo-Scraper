"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Periodontal Flap Surgery,",0,0,YES,Dr.Prafulla provided an excellent explanation of the procedure- thus expelling any fears/doubts related to the complex surgery. She was accommodative of my schedule & conducted the surgery keeping my personal time constraints in mind. The surgery was completely painless and she conducted the same seamlessly. I was very comfortable on the chair & was in-fact enjoying the background music being played in the clinic. On a jocular note- I also requested a change in the background music which was also complied with. She thoroughly explained the important after surgery care to be taken by me at home. She was also available to me on WhatsApp and asked me to contact her anytime- in case of questions or an emergency. I contacted her regarding a question and got an immediate response from her. All in all- a very satisfying experience & I would recommend her excellent treatment/care to anybody requiring the same.,2022-05-21 03:08:50,False,True,Visesh Challa,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Periodontal Flap Surgery,",0,0,YES,"Dr Prafulla is one of the most competent and understanding individuals that I‚Äôve met till date. Not only does she understand the patients worry and apprehensions but she takes time in explaining and addressing every minute detail of the concern that one may have. I went to her with periodontitis and she administered a lazer flap gum surgery to relieve me of my problem. Her surgical capabilities surpass the ordinary. So smooth was the entire process ( though it‚Äôs a long procedure) that I didn‚Äôt even feel a thing and and am now on my way to healing and recovery.
I must also thank her entire team for being super efficient at fixing appointments as per my convenience and comfort. I would recommend this clinic hands down.",2022-04-07 05:01:17,False,True,POOJA DHAWAN,,,

"Treatment satisfaction,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,",0,0,YES,Madam thanks for the treatment except for some pain which is still there no serious problem. One thing the surgeon after reviewing my file asked me whether left side or right side. Whether upper portion or lower. If it was for confirmation ok but the way he asked was difficult to understand. No problem. 2nd thing the fees charged is really on very much higher side. I had expected it to be between Rs 2000_3000. Think of it.
