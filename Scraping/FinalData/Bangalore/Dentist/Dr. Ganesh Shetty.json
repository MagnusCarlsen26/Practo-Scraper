He is  very knowledgeable, skillful thoughtful and caring, Importantly he is very Patient and explains the issues very clearly.  His workmanship is superb and he is very focused He happens to be the doctor of choice of everyone I know, my friends, my colleagues and my family, WE ALL SIMPLY VOUCH FOR HIM>\n\nI have had various dental treatments under him for the last 10 years  and  my experiences has been extremely pleasant satisfying and reassuring, \nand coming from a health industry background and I do respect for his depth of knowledge and approach.  \n\nMy daughter just had her 4 pre molar extractions and Dr Shetty did lso wonderfully; it was super quick and painless. She is already in awe with his style. Importantly there is lot of patient empathy  and he kind of understands the nature of pain discomfort and prepares patient before during and after any procedure. He certainly has  a knack to connect to all kind of people.  My  husband, daughters, Mother in law sought treatment with Dr Ganesh for varied issues and each of us and each time have been happy and reassured.\n\nDr Shetty never charges to make a person feel happier; :-) We love the humour always. The clinic ambience the doctors share a very positive and patient centric attitude. The recent visit , we saw that all COVID measures have taken care of.\n\nThank you Doctor to make us confident each day\nThank you doctor for keeping our anxieties at bay\n\nRegards\nLakshmi Satish\np.s: I just happened to read about a patient's non healing wound. It is unfortunate that the patient had to go through long healing process; our bodies respond differently to interventions. I am sure the doctor has taken the  correct steps and measure  to ensure the optimal treatment for the patient.",

Next When i asked him the Technical specifications of the Dental implant, he initially gave a very negative reply that the clinic does not provide such specs. Further, when I requested, he did oblige and gave me 4 options of the implant to check out from Google. I did so sincerely and also checked out the rates/implant. So, in my 3rd consultation, I was just briefing his doctor - Dr Rakshita shetty on the option I chose and mentioned that it costed 25,000. For which she refuted by saying that it costed 29,000. Anyway,  I requested to look into the cost effectiveness of the overall implant as the overall cost of my 3 planned teeth was some where between 1- 1.2 Lakhs. I am conversing with Dr Rakshita shetty, in the meantime, this Dr Ganesh Shetty came rushing from another room and just came straight to me and started questioning me in the following manner:\nAre you bargaining with us Sir?\nI replied \"No\" very politely. I said i did what he asked me to do which was to  explore the options given and chose 1 option in my point of view *** **** *** ** ****** ****** * ******* ** ******** ** ******* \nHe asked me as to whether  the price of implant was given in google, for which i replied \"Yes\".\nCompletely overruling my Health concern, he rudely replied \"We don't work with Bargaining customers\"\nFurther i responded saying that I am not bargaining and just reflected what was put in google in terms of the type of implant and was only requesting the cost effectiveness and efficacy of it.\n\nImmediately his next reply was \" We don't want work with bargaining customers\"\nJudging his curt and rude responses I  politely asked him whether he doesn't like to work with me? for which he replied \"YES\" ( Pl NOTE THIS IMPORTANT POINT)*** **** * ********* ****** **** * *** **** ** ******** ************ ***** ** ****** ** *** ******  *** **** * *** ***** ******* **** ******** **** *** ******** **  * ****** ****** ** *** **** ********* ** **** ************ ******* ********* ** ***** **** *** ***** ************ **** *** **** ** *** ********* ******** ************ *** ** *** **** **** ** **** *** ***** ******** I was extremely shocked at this Doctors behaviour, Mind set, *** ********* This was my first bad experience with a person from this profession.

Dr. said that my wife has really co-operated well. As stitching was done, Dr. asked to make a visit after 10 days to remove the stitching and also said that bleeding will happen, keep swallowing as it\u2019s normal. My spouse was on medication and was not comfortable even after 2 days and spoke to Jr. Dr. and I stated that bleeding is still happening and she is having continuous pain. Jr. Dr. said, it\u2019s normal so nothing to worry and if there is more problem please make a visit to clinic on Monday (after 2 days). The bleeding was continuously happening even after 4 days and she continued with swallowing as Dr. said it\u2019s normal. We visited on 9th day, after informing the clinic for removing the stitches. Dr. Ganesh Shetty informed that healing has not happened and hence dressing would be required on a daily basis for next 4-5 days. It was bit surprising to know that healing has not happened as my spouse does not have any medical problem. She was not feeling good inside her mouth and was complaining about the pain in the same side of jaw as well as head, since 4 days post-surgery.  Next day, we visited again, and my wife complained about the pain in tongue, jaw and head. Dr. realized that there was mouth ulcer and he filed the teeth. She came and sat in the car and I saw she was profusely crying. On checking \u2013 she complained about the severe pain. I could not control and called his number and spoke to him in tougher tone and asked why so much pain now and have you removed any piece of the teeth. He said I am a Dr. or you are a Dr. and said come and meet me in clinic, we will talk. I met him but he was not very convincing on why the healing has not happened\u2026* * ********* ********* ***** ***** *** thought to see another Dr.\n \nI visited another Dr. in my locality the same evening. *** *** * ******** ***** *** ******** **** ** *** ******* *** *** ******** ******** ** *** ****** ********** ***** *** ******* ** **** ** ******** *** **** ***** **** ******** **** ****** ** **** **** ******* ** *** **** **** ***** *********** My wife was complaining about unpleasant taste in mouth since 3-4 days of surgery. *** ****** ** ***** ** *** *** ** *** ***** **** ******* ***** *** ** ***** ** **** **** ***** *** ******* *** **** ********* *** *** **** ******** *** ** ** * ********* ***** ** ***** **** ******** **** ****** ****** *** **** *** *** * *** *** * ** *** * **** ***** *** *** ******** *** **** *** ******** ** * ** **** ***** *** ****** ****** *** *** *** *** ************** **** ********* *** *** **** ********* *** **** * *** ** ****** ****** *** * ***** ** *** ****** ****** *** ****** * ****** ** *** *** * *** *** ***** ** *** ** ****** ****** *** **** ******** ************* *** **** ** **** *** ****** **** **** ****** *** ************ You definitely have LOST US and would never recommend to anyone.",

Recently a friend recommended Dr. Ganesh and I decided to give him a try, and am I glad I did! Dr. Ganesh is friendly and makes you feel comfortable right from the start. He's very practical in his approach and doesn't force any treatment. The wisdom tooth surgery was over in 15min and he prescribed medication that kept the swelling to a minimum and pain mostly at bay. I was able to get back to work the next day itself. I also went through a root canal treatment. The doctor (Dr.Ravi?) who did the root canal seemed very experienced and the procedure was over before I knew it.\n\nDr. Ganesh constantly checks on you to make sure you're doing ok, and tries his best to reduce any discomfort or pain you might have. The support staff, Dr. Ashwini and Dr. Nithin are very courteous and always have a smile on their face - which makes a world of a difference when you're visiting a doctor! :) The clinic has a nice vibe to it - the staff seem to enjoy their work and it rubs off positively on patients as well.\n\nThe only negative is the long wait times...but I guess it's part of the pitfalls of going to a really good doctor. Dr. Ganesh is congnizant of it and apologies when it's a busy day! \n\nOverall I've had a nice experience at the clinic...Amazing doc, pleasant staff, clean clinic and good music to add :)",

In all three of instances I got to see doctor just once which gave me some relief. All the work was done by compounders/other not so proficient so called doctors. But I was relaxed thinking I am in good hand. Root canal was also consulted with the doctor and the day was decided.

He is  very knowledgeable, skillful thoughtful and caring, Importantly he is very Patient and explains the issues very clearly.  His workmanship is superb and he is very focused He happens to be the doctor of choice of everyone I know, my friends, my colleagues and my family, WE ALL SIMPLY VOUCH FOR HIM>\n\nI have had various dental treatments under him for the last 10 years  and  my experiences has been extremely pleasant satisfying and reassuring, \nand coming from a health industry background and I do respect for his depth of knowledge and approach.  \n\nMy daughter just had her 4 pre molar extractions and Dr Shetty did lso wonderfully; it was super quick and painless. She is already in awe with his style. Importantly there is lot of patient empathy  and he kind of understands the nature of pain discomfort and prepares patient before during and after any procedure. He certainly has  a knack to connect to all kind of people.  My  husband, daughters, Mother in law sought treatment with Dr Ganesh for varied issues and each of us and each time have been happy and reassured.\n\nDr Shetty never charges to make a person feel happier; :-) We love the humour always. The clinic ambience the doctors share a very positive and patient centric attitude. The recent visit , we saw that all COVID measures have taken care of.\n\nThank you Doctor to make us confident each day\nThank you doctor for keeping our anxieties at bay\n\nRegards\nLakshmi Satish\np.s: I just happened to read about a patient's non healing wound. It is unfortunate that the patient had to go through long healing process; our bodies respond differently to interventions. I am sure the doctor has taken the  correct steps and measure  to ensure the optimal treatment for the patient.",

Next When i asked him the Technical specifications of the Dental implant, he initially gave a very negative reply that the clinic does not provide such specs. Further, when I requested, he did oblige and gave me 4 options of the implant to check out from Google. I did so sincerely and also checked out the rates/implant. So, in my 3rd consultation, I was just briefing his doctor - Dr Rakshita shetty on the option I chose and mentioned that it costed 25,000. For which she refuted by saying that it costed 29,000. Anyway,  I requested to look into the cost effectiveness of the overall implant as the overall cost of my 3 planned teeth was some where between 1- 1.2 Lakhs. I am conversing with Dr Rakshita shetty, in the meantime, this Dr Ganesh Shetty came rushing from another room and just came straight to me and started questioning me in the following manner:\nAre you bargaining with us Sir?\nI replied \"No\" very politely. I said i did what he asked me to do which was to  explore the options given and chose 1 option in my point of view *** **** *** ** ****** ****** * ******* ** ******** ** ******* \nHe asked me as to whether  the price of implant was given in google, for which i replied \"Yes\".\nCompletely overruling my Health concern, he rudely replied \"We don't work with Bargaining customers\"\nFurther i responded saying that I am not bargaining and just reflected what was put in google in terms of the type of implant and was only requesting the cost effectiveness and efficacy of it.\n\nImmediately his next reply was \" We don't want work with bargaining customers\"\nJudging his curt and rude responses I  politely asked him whether he doesn't like to work with me? for which he replied \"YES\" ( Pl NOTE THIS IMPORTANT POINT)*** **** * ********* ****** **** * *** **** ** ******** ************ ***** ** ****** ** *** ******  *** **** * *** ***** ******* **** ******** **** *** ******** **  * ****** ****** ** *** **** ********* ** **** ************ ******* ********* ** ***** **** *** ***** ************ **** *** **** ** *** ********* ******** ************ *** ** *** **** **** ** **** *** ***** ******** I was extremely shocked at this Doctors behaviour, Mind set, *** ********* This was my first bad experience with a person from this profession.

Dr. said that my wife has really co-operated well. As stitching was done, Dr. asked to make a visit after 10 days to remove the stitching and also said that bleeding will happen, keep swallowing as it\u2019s normal. My spouse was on medication and was not comfortable even after 2 days and spoke to Jr. Dr. and I stated that bleeding is still happening and she is having continuous pain. Jr. Dr. said, it\u2019s normal so nothing to worry and if there is more problem please make a visit to clinic on Monday (after 2 days). The bleeding was continuously happening even after 4 days and she continued with swallowing as Dr. said it\u2019s normal. We visited on 9th day, after informing the clinic for removing the stitches. Dr. Ganesh Shetty informed that healing has not happened and hence dressing would be required on a daily basis for next 4-5 days. It was bit surprising to know that healing has not happened as my spouse does not have any medical problem. She was not feeling good inside her mouth and was complaining about the pain in the same side of jaw as well as head, since 4 days post-surgery.  Next day, we visited again, and my wife complained about the pain in tongue, jaw and head. Dr. realized that there was mouth ulcer and he filed the teeth. She came and sat in the car and I saw she was profusely crying. On checking \u2013 she complained about the severe pain. I could not control and called his number and spoke to him in tougher tone and asked why so much pain now and have you removed any piece of the teeth. He said I am a Dr. or you are a Dr. and said come and meet me in clinic, we will talk. I met him but he was not very convincing on why the healing has not happened\u2026* * ********* ********* ***** ***** *** thought to see another Dr.\n \nI visited another Dr. in my locality the same evening. *** *** * ******** ***** *** ******** **** ** *** ******* *** *** ******** ******** ** *** ****** ********** ***** *** ******* ** **** ** ******** *** **** ***** **** ******** **** ****** ** **** **** ******* ** *** **** **** ***** *********** My wife was complaining about unpleasant taste in mouth since 3-4 days of surgery. *** ****** ** ***** ** *** *** ** *** ***** **** ******* ***** *** ** ***** ** **** **** ***** *** ******* *** **** ********* *** *** **** ******** *** ** ** * ********* ***** ** ***** **** ******** **** ****** ****** *** **** *** *** * *** *** * ** *** * **** ***** *** *** ******** *** **** *** ******** ** * ** **** ***** *** ****** ****** *** *** *** *** ************** **** ********* *** *** **** ********* *** **** * *** ** ****** ****** *** * ***** ** *** ****** ****** *** ****** * ****** ** *** *** * *** *** ***** ** *** ** ****** ****** *** **** ******** ************* *** **** ** **** *** ****** **** **** ****** *** ************ You definitely have LOST US and would never recommend to anyone.",

Recently a friend recommended Dr. Ganesh and I decided to give him a try, and am I glad I did! Dr. Ganesh is friendly and makes you feel comfortable right from the start. He's very practical in his approach and doesn't force any treatment. The wisdom tooth surgery was over in 15min and he prescribed medication that kept the swelling to a minimum and pain mostly at bay. I was able to get back to work the next day itself. I also went through a root canal treatment. The doctor (Dr.Ravi?) who did the root canal seemed very experienced and the procedure was over before I knew it.\n\nDr. Ganesh constantly checks on you to make sure you're doing ok, and tries his best to reduce any discomfort or pain you might have. The support staff, Dr. Ashwini and Dr. Nithin are very courteous and always have a smile on their face - which makes a world of a difference when you're visiting a doctor! :) The clinic has a nice vibe to it - the staff seem to enjoy their work and it rubs off positively on patients as well.\n\nThe only negative is the long wait times...but I guess it's part of the pitfalls of going to a really good doctor. Dr. Ganesh is congnizant of it and apologies when it's a busy day! \n\nOverall I've had a nice experience at the clinic...Amazing doc, pleasant staff, clean clinic and good music to add :)",

In all three of instances I got to see doctor just once which gave me some relief. All the work was done by compounders/other not so proficient so called doctors. But I was relaxed thinking I am in good hand. Root canal was also consulted with the doctor and the day was decided.

I was diagnosed with a heavily \"impacted\" lower wisdom tooth that needed to be extracted. The initial diagnosis suggested that the procedure would be take 45 minutes (usually 15 minutes), but we were all surprised when the tooth was more impacted and submerged within the bone cavity than initially expected therefore extending the entire procedure to almost 2 hours! Usually one would expect both the doctor and the patient to freak out in such circumstances. However, Dr Shetty was cool as a cucumber and kept taking me through the process in a way that made me feel comfortable too. This I believe is the greatest quality that a surgeon needs to have and Dr Shetty definitely does. All thats well ends well, and so did the surgery. I am still in the process of recovering but the healing (I had sutures placed for 10 days) is fast and I am confident that its only a matter of days that I am completely back to normal.\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend Dr Ganesh Shetty as a trusted and experienced surgeon to anyone in need for a top notch dental/oral procedure.\r\n\r\nPS: I criss-cross 30 Kms and 90 minutes of traffic to meet Dr Shetty and its definitely worth it.",

Will seriously suggest not to fall for it. I would not go to his clinic if I am going to be attended by a junior doctor. I shouldn't be commenting on their capability but just didn't feel comfortable with the way they dealt with me.\n\nHere are a few pointers before you visit them:\n- Ratings: Don't fall for the ratings unless you are attended by Dr.Ganesh himself (which didn't happen in both my visits) \n\n- Appointments: don't bother booking an appointment on practo they don't care about the time - you might be made to wait for atleast 1 hour or even more(that's what happened in my case)\n\n- Pricing: On the higher side, but you wouldn't mind if you will have a senior doctor attend to or do your procedure.\n\nAll in all just not a very nice experience for me. Hope they internalise this feedback and ensure they fix this for patients that will visit them in the future.",

Then Dr. Ganesh tried to pull my tooth out and it was extremely painful. He gave me another injection and I could feel the prick. That is when I realized and told him that the anesthetic effect had completely faded. I think a good doctor would have known for how long the anesthetic is effective. He later tried to extract my tooth and gave up half way through and said that he can't go ahead since I was not cooperating. I would really like to meet the person whose tooth was pulled out without being administered the anesthetic injection and still cooperated with Dr. Ganesh. I asked him to take an x-ray to see why it was so painful. He refused to do that which I think is a protocol for all dentists to follow before pulling out the wisdom tooth. I pleaded with him 4 to 5 times to try again but he was very adamant and would just not listen. I felt I was ditched and left to suffer. I finally had to rush to another dentist, with heavily bleeding gums, who was kind enough to understand my plight and successfully treated me immediately. ",

But this time I had no alternative than visiting a dentist . I had a severe tooth infection due to an improperly done root canal before by some other dentist and the pain was excruciating. But it was Doctor Shetty who treated me well and I knew I was in safe hands. As the teeth was severly infected, I was given a choice to either get a re root canal or extract it. I chose the latter. After that it was a cakewalk...Dr removed the teeth  and I was like..is it done!!!  The entire process was extremely comforting and  I did not even feel even the slightest pain.

I always wait for my holidays in Spain to meet my family dentist and do the annual review.  \n\nA month ago I started to feel pain in one of my left molars. I was so scared to meet another dentist so I just took some medication in hope to solve the problem. The pain continued and finaly a friend told me about Dr Ganesh.\n\nIn the beggining I was very skeptical but now I am glad to have met him. After the checking, he calmly explained what was the problem and the steps to solve it. He is a great professional and I highly recommend him to anyone (specialy if you are looking for high standards). It gave me the confidence that all will go well. And it went perfectly well. I am so happy to have a dentist in Bangalore whom I can trust. \n\nThe clinic and all the team follow all the precautions to avoid Covid infections.\n\nI can only thank Dr. Ganesh and team",

When I met Dr Ganesh Shetty( was recommended by a friend) he first explained the root cause for this , saying my enamel has eroded and this can be fixed by using a specific tooth paste and regular cleaning. The way this doctor approaches the issue and explains to his patient is amazing and this gives me confidence to recommend his services to friends and family. That explains why there is always a queue of patients waiting to be treated by a bunch of good dentists lead by Dr. Ganesh Shetty. I highly recommend his services and would be more than happy to recommend him for all dental issues . Last but not the least the clinic is spic and span and also they follow all protocols post COVID which is another important aspect to note during these testing times . Kudos to the team and their good work. All the best!",

He simply smiled and calmed me saying \"nah... It happens. We are well protected like you\" So humbled... Absolutely humbled. Its a reminder for me to calm down, take care, be thankful for the services rendered by front line team like the medical profession. It certainly made me see different perspective of life, be a more responsible and compassionate person.\n\nThank you, team Dr. Ganesh Shetty\n\nSincerely & Respectfully yours\n\nJose Abraham",

So it was great that I could meet the doctor on time. The preliminary oral check-up was good, followed by the x-ray to confirm the problem. The issue was explained clearly and I was able to start the treatment for the root canal on the same day.\nOverall a well planned treatment, the clinic has high standards of cleanliness and latest in tech equipment. The doctor was excellent and kept checking during the process if patient was fine and comfortable.",

I felt this is absolutely unprofessional as we expected Dr.shetty to handle the task which might have not led to complication .",

Anyways will give a benefit of doubt here,\r\nThe cap came out with in 15 days and mom couldnt fix it as she was in the US. When we came back he refused to fix another cap even though it was service deficiency on his part.\r\nI seriously doubt his ethics and capability as he doesnt do any RCT and gets another \"specialist\" and not sure how can he give advise on any issues related to RCT. In general he pushes for needless RCT.\r\n\r\n1. Go to the clinic if u want to listen to good music.\r\n2. Do not visit his clinic if you want to get any serious dental work done.\r\n3. Overpriced services\r\n4. Improper service: he needs to remember we pay him not for the \"cap\" but for the issue resolution.\r\nAll in all 12k down the drain. ",

This relaxes you to a great extent. I was advised by the doctor for a root canal after taking an x-ray and understanding the necessity for the procedure. The procedure was spread over multiple sittings and I have one more visit, to complete the treatment. The procedure so far has been painless and the interaction with the doctor and staff has been very professional and friendly. \n\nI especially appreciate the level of hygiene and sanitation undertaken by the entire team and I would recommend this clinic without a doubt to anyone around the area and definitely to all my friends.

He is also patient, cheerful and in all my visits has never once criticised the 'state of my dentition' - but has always provided solutions. His clinic is well maintained and hygienic. And finally, he never overcharges, but is very reasonable. For all these reasons, he has been not only mine, but my entire family's dentist. Would I recommend him ? Definitely yes!",
