We were planning to travel next day but cancelled the plan and started looking for dentist. I showed it to different dentist but they suggested immediate RCT or tooth removal and the cost estimated was also very high. As she was diabetic, I was bit skeptical about this and had no confidence in doctor around. Even with high dosage of pain killer the pain was not subsiding. My mother was saying lets do something for pain, I will goto village and get it done there. Finally I took her to Dr Suresh with reference from Dr Nagaraj. He asked all the details, checked the teeth and said today I will just do the clean up for the infection and put medicine. She will not be in pain after that. You can travel without any worry. After you are back if she is comfortable we will do RCT else she can get it done from her village doctor.This suggestion itself gave us lot of confidence and we gave go ahead to this. He showed lot of patience, did the procedure as per her comfort and talked very calmly throughout this. My mother was very happy with him. Later we got the RCT and cap fitting also done from him :-)  With corporate culture in hospitals, it is really difficult to find doctors who gives genuine suggestion and I am happy we found Dr Suresh when we needed the most.",

They diagnose, with a blink of an eye you will find yourself out of dentists clinic with your tooth issue resolved... Basically everything is so mechanical. It was different with Dr Suresh, who with a Buddha like calmness not only explained what was wrong with my tooth, the way he carried out the procedure was commendable. I haven't been using my right side if the jaw for years even after a 'successful' treatment was carried out here in Mumbai. It was only after Dr. Suresh's treatment that I came to know what was wrong and after he 're-fixing' my tooth, iam happily chewing away from the right side of my jaw. I only pray that God forbid, if at all I have to visit dentist again may it be in Bangalore :D",

We were planning to travel next day but cancelled the plan and started looking for dentist. I showed it to different dentist but they suggested immediate RCT or tooth removal and the cost estimated was also very high. As she was diabetic, I was bit skeptical about this and had no confidence in doctor around. Even with high dosage of pain killer the pain was not subsiding. My mother was saying lets do something for pain, I will goto village and get it done there. Finally I took her to Dr Suresh with reference from Dr Nagaraj. He asked all the details, checked the teeth and said today I will just do the clean up for the infection and put medicine. She will not be in pain after that. You can travel without any worry. After you are back if she is comfortable we will do RCT else she can get it done from her village doctor.This suggestion itself gave us lot of confidence and we gave go ahead to this. He showed lot of patience, did the procedure as per her comfort and talked very calmly throughout this. My mother was very happy with him. Later we got the RCT and cap fitting also done from him :-)  With corporate culture in hospitals, it is really difficult to find doctors who gives genuine suggestion and I am happy we found Dr Suresh when we needed the most.",

They diagnose, with a blink of an eye you will find yourself out of dentists clinic with your tooth issue resolved... Basically everything is so mechanical. It was different with Dr Suresh, who with a Buddha like calmness not only explained what was wrong with my tooth, the way he carried out the procedure was commendable. I haven't been using my right side if the jaw for years even after a 'successful' treatment was carried out here in Mumbai. It was only after Dr. Suresh's treatment that I came to know what was wrong and after he 're-fixing' my tooth, iam happily chewing away from the right side of my jaw. I only pray that God forbid, if at all I have to visit dentist again may it be in Bangalore :D",
