I was so convinced that in two days only, I completed consultation + diagnosis + operation and third day i am perfectly all right. Thanks for such smooth experience. Couple of feedbacks for clinic, tough, I would like to give:\n1) bp and sugar report requirement was told me later point of time, it would be always great that patient should know during initial consultation, so that he can feel more comfortable collecting all diagnostic reports at one shot.\n\n2) do's and don't explained me after extraction, here, it would be really nice that patients should be informed twice about it - once before extraction and later just quick recap. It will set their mind very well and if any preparation like ice cube etc can be taken care comfortable way. Also, aftrr extraction patient wont be able to talk for sometime, sl creates communication gap for such details. \n\n3) power management could be slightly better, lots of trip can scare patients and their relatives.\n\nI hope these feedback will help Impression team to do more greater thing as I found their mindset assertive.

She was accommodative of my schedule & conducted the surgery keeping my personal time constraints in mind. The surgery was completely painless and she conducted the same seamlessly. I was very comfortable on the chair & was in-fact enjoying the background music being played in the clinic. On a jocular note- I also requested a change in the background music which was also complied with. She thoroughly explained the important after surgery care to be taken by me at home. She was also available to me on WhatsApp and asked me to contact her anytime- in case of questions or an emergency. I contacted her regarding a question and got an immediate response from her. All in all- a very satisfying experience & I would recommend her excellent treatment/care to anybody requiring the same.",

I was so convinced that in two days only, I completed consultation + diagnosis + operation and third day i am perfectly all right. Thanks for such smooth experience. Couple of feedbacks for clinic, tough, I would like to give:\n1) bp and sugar report requirement was told me later point of time, it would be always great that patient should know during initial consultation, so that he can feel more comfortable collecting all diagnostic reports at one shot.\n\n2) do's and don't explained me after extraction, here, it would be really nice that patients should be informed twice about it - once before extraction and later just quick recap. It will set their mind very well and if any preparation like ice cube etc can be taken care comfortable way. Also, aftrr extraction patient wont be able to talk for sometime, sl creates communication gap for such details. \n\n3) power management could be slightly better, lots of trip can scare patients and their relatives.\n\nI hope these feedback will help Impression team to do more greater thing as I found their mindset assertive.

On a jocular note- I also requested a change in the background music which was also complied with. She thoroughly explained the important after surgery care to be taken by me at home. She was also available to me on WhatsApp and asked me to contact her anytime- in case of questions or an emergency. I contacted her regarding a question and got an immediate response from her. All in all- a very satisfying experience & I would recommend her excellent treatment/care to anybody requiring the same.",
