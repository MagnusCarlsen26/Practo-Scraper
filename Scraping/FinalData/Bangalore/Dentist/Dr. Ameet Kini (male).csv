Before visiting Dr. Ameet Kini’s Power Smiles Dental Speciality clinic, we had consulted two other dentists and both the dentists explained that for my son, one permanent tooth extraction will be required to make space for teeth alignment.

I had avoided visiting a dentist for years despite the  increasing gaps in my teeth. I was afraid of going through a lot of unnecessary and expensive treatments. Dr. Ameet was recommended to me by a freind.

On the first visit he clearly laid out treatment options and helped me to choose one that best suited my budget and time. He also didnt add any extra unnecessary treatments.
This is very important to mention because 
A dentist I had visited prior to him told me I needed to remove a ""dead tooth and gave me only two options the prohibitively expensive invisaligners and braces which I didnt want to go through again. I was very relieved to know that I didn't have to get any teeth pulled out before starting the treatment. 
Dr. Ameet is very patient and honest about answering all questions and doubts and gives a balanced reply so that the patient can take an informed decision. 
He is very flexible about working around the given time frame to meet the patients needs and priorities.
