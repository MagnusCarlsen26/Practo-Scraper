She is very transparent on the treatment plans and gives a heads-up for the next appointment and the procedures to be done before patient leaves the clinicThe cost of treatment is really reasonable within Bangalore and transparent and no hidden charges.She is also careful and not in a hurry to finish the scheduled appointment. if a scheduled procedure takes longer time she divides the treatment into multiple settings.Overall i recommend Dr. Nita Kashyap for a must visit for the patients for all your Oral problems",

When I enquired on the different types of treatment, she took time off in her busy schedules and cleared all my doubts. She recommended treatment for my genuine dental issues and advised against high cost non-required treatment. She is friendly, a go-to-doctor and affords cost effective treatment. I had recommended her to all my friends, spouse and relatives for dental treatment. I appreciate and thank her for her service. Thank you madam.",

The procedure was very smooth, and I didn't face any pain during the treatment. RCT was completed in 3 sessions (including cap fixing) and filings were done smoothly in one sitting. I would definitely recommend the Dental Hub to anyone who is facing dental issues as well as for regular check ups. Dr. Nita is exceptionally adept in her work. Additionally, the rates are very reasonable compared to market standards in Bangalore, and you'll be more than happy to pay quoted amount for the level of treatment received. ",

The doctor was kind and explained me all the details about the procedure. It just took around 5 minutes for the extraction and it was painless (obviously because of the anesthesia) and quick. He then explained me what I needed to do next and he even repeated 2 to 3 times if in case I forget. Highly recommend Dr. Imran if you have any problems regarding your tooth.

She is very transparent on the treatment plans and gives a heads-up for the next appointment and the procedures to be done before patient leaves the clinicThe cost of treatment is really reasonable within Bangalore and transparent and no hidden charges.She is also careful and not in a hurry to finish the scheduled appointment. if a scheduled procedure takes longer time she divides the treatment into multiple settings.Overall i recommend Dr. Nita Kashyap for a must visit for the patients for all your Oral problems",

When I enquired on the different types of treatment, she took time off in her busy schedules and cleared all my doubts. She recommended treatment for my genuine dental issues and advised against high cost non-required treatment. She is friendly, a go-to-doctor and affords cost effective treatment. I had recommended her to all my friends, spouse and relatives for dental treatment. I appreciate and thank her for her service. Thank you madam.",

The procedure was very smooth, and I didn't face any pain during the treatment. RCT was completed in 3 sessions (including cap fixing) and filings were done smoothly in one sitting. I would definitely recommend the Dental Hub to anyone who is facing dental issues as well as for regular check ups. Dr. Nita is exceptionally adept in her work. Additionally, the rates are very reasonable compared to market standards in Bangalore, and you'll be more than happy to pay quoted amount for the level of treatment received. ",

He visits The Dental Hub in bysandra area CV Raman Nagar. I was really nervous about the extraction as this was my first time but I was literally blown away by the experience. The doctor was kind and explained me all the details about the procedure. It just took around 5 minutes for the extraction and it was painless (obviously because of the anesthesia) and quick. He then explained me what I needed to do next and he even repeated 2 to 3 times if in case I forget. Highly recommend Dr. Imran if you have any problems regarding your tooth.

I still remember the first thing was she started talking to her in a very friendly manner.  She always use to first  calm her down and then start with procedure.  Final thing were those smileys which she used to give my daughter post treatment. \n\nShe can handle small kids very nicely  she understand their mood and then starts off with the procedure.\n\nShe is really a very friendly caring and  at  the same time  proficient in her treatment procedures.\n\nShe did RCT for me too. She did the procedure very slowly so that I don't feel any pain. \n\nPost treatment for any issue I had called or messaged her she had always replied to my issues. \n\n",

As per the current situation, you are having pain due to food lodgement between the treated tooth and the adjacent tooth for which we planned a consultation with the prosthodontist and decide further treatment plan, we never suggested ReRCT at the first place. Our focus is always to provide quality and best possible treatment.\n\nYou had also visited us on April 2021 for full mouth cleaning and did not have any complaint or discomfort.\n\nOur priority is and will always be patient satisfaction and we will be more than happy to provide you the best treatment possible.\n\nThe Dental Hub",

However, we strongly oppose such allegations of not being transparent. 100+ positive feedbacks from satisfied customers are proof of that. We have been in this business for over 6 years now and have always maintained a transparent and justified charging system of the treatment provided.\n\nYou were clearly explained everything during consultation with 2 x-rays of 2 different parts of your mouth to get seriousness of the cavity. You were told that you can opt for cleaning before going for filling (which will be done next day). You even called your husband and then only confirmed that you want to get the cleaning done. A simple NO would have avoided your dissatisfaction. All the charges for consultation, x-rays, cleaning and filling were told before proceeding and we went ahead only after your confirmation (and your husband's). As we value the customer we just charged for one x-ray. \n\nThe filling was done next day as promised. We take pride in our services would like to inform others reading the feedback to visit the clinic and experience our services firsthand. You editing your feedback thrice speaks volume about the confusion you have regarding how you want to bring the whole thing in a bad light. We hope you are feeling much better after the treatment and we would always be available to help you in any way possible in future as well.\n\nThanks and regards,\nTeam Dental Hub",

There are certain things that are out of our control. Your kid started screaming and crying during the consultation itself on 30th Nov (when we didn't even start the treatment) and you were not able to stop him and let us talk. Still the doctor managed and explained you the whole process and cost but you still wanted the doctor to explain the procedure and cost on your next visit this month, which we did gladly again.\n\nYour son was not ready to sit in the chair, let alone start the treatment, and we spent around 45 minutes just to calm him. You were clearly told if your son is not able to cooperate we will have to ask a child specialist (pedodontist) for which charges will be extra but you were not ready for that too. \n\nEven after 2 visits for consultation you haven't paid the full amount (Rs 300) and for treatment which we started and spent 45 minutes of effort you did not pay anything.\n\nWe as The Dental Hub team try our best to ensure a smooth process and treatment where everything is explained in advance and the patient feels comfortable. If you are ready to get a pedodontist examine and treat your child you can visit the clinic again and I'm sure we will be able to change your view.\n- The Dental Hub",
