We had a pleasant experience with the doctors, they were friendly made us comfortable and explained clearly should we go for removal or wait for sometime. We have decided for extraction and the job was done smoothly. My wife never felt pain during the surgery and it was over in 5-10mins. Suggestions and followup were also good, they never charge for unnecessary procedures. Very impressive I must say and do recommend them all the times",
