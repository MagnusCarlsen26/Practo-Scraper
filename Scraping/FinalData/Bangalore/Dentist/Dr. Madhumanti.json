First of all, the very first day of your consultation, the entire treatment plan was explained to you with their respective charges. Informed consent was taken from you before performing any procedure. You seemed to be very confused and anxious and that is why we had even asked you to come with your parents on the following appointments which you did not . I understand you had to wait in the reception area for 20 mins approx. but since on weekends there are lots of patients seeking appointments, we also expect a little patience from you. We have not suggested extraction for your upper tooth but only a filling. Extraction of upper teeth was suggested by some other clinic that you had visited to recheck on our treatments. Confusion happens when you visit multiple clinics and  get multiple suggestions, the result being nothing but increased confusions. Good to see that you have nowhere mentioned regarding the unimpaired healing that you had after undergoing a bony impaction surgery. Nowhere you had mentioned regarding the calls and messages that I have personally done to make sure that you are not having any discomfort after  surgery. \nAnyways, wish you good luck and good health.",

She is not upfront with the charges.You book appointment to get consultation from her, but some other assistant of her examines and reports to her. Then doctor listens to her and tells what to do. I went to see the doctor for tooth decay in the molar tooth, and asked her for a thorough examination of all teeth. I  waited for 45 min even though I had booked appointment. She hastily checked the tooth and asked for X-Ray to examine the tooth thoroughly. It was all fine till then. I was somewhat okay with her approach, and she seemed nice. After seeing the x-ray, she told she might have to extract the tooth and told the cost to be Rs 1000-2000. But after I got the tooth removed, I was asked to pay Rs 3500. WHY WAS I NOT INFORMED OF THE PRICE CHANGE EARLIER?? I felt deceived. I again went to see the doctor for a checkup few days after. WHY DID SOMEONE ELSE EXAMINED MY TEETH WHEN I HAD BOOKED AN APPOINTMENT TO CONSULT HER? Again her assistant examines the teeth, and tells that some other tooth has deep cavity and needs to be removed. WHY WAS A THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF ALL TEETH NOT DONE EARLIER?? That's it. I lost faith in her. Next day I went to see another famous doctor in Indiranagar. She examined the teeth thoroughly and told that I had a cavity in the tooth just above the one which was removed earlier. She told me that I should have got both teeth removed at the same time before only and suffered the pain only once. \n\nWould conclude by saying that the experience was really bad with Tooth Story Clinic and with Dr Madhumanti, as she could have done both surgeries together and I would have suffered less.",

I had a jaw pain (because of some surgery done 5 years ago). Due to this, I consulted my surgeon and he recommended to continue the RCT under his supervision. I couldn't continue my RCT treatment with doctor because of these complications. As I was helpless, I asked doctor to refund some of the amount from 4000 rs(which was taken at the start of the RCT). But the doctor refused to refund anything saying it's against their policies. I recommend people to think clearly before investing money here as in any case of emergency doctor won't refund anything. Even in big corporate hospitals money is taken per sitting / per treatment basis after treatment is done. And I believe in case of such emergencies they would also give it a thought about refund. \n\nAlso, I had called in the morning and booked appointment at 6.30pm, which was pushed to 7.30 by the assistant at around 6pm because of busy schedule. Then for the 7.30 pm slot, I had to wait for half n hour again because of busy schedule. Then I had the above discussion with the doctor for which she said that we could have talked over phone (for such critical matter) and not wasted her 1 hour of slot. But I had also waited for half n hour which the doctor did not observe. \nAlso, now after I have visited a dentist under the supervision of my surgeon says that the post in the tooth while doing the RCT is broken and thus the tooth cannot be saved as the post had become small and stuck in the root canal. Therefore, I have to now go for tooth extraction itself. \n\nPlease be very sure of your case and then only visit the doctor.\n\nThank you. ",

She is very patient *** **** *** ** *** *** ** **** *** ***** **** ** ********** She is a perfectionist and does not leave you with a half-baked job. In my case, the metal crown came with some defects. She tested this herself and got a new crown made. She is friendly, explains the issues clearly and seems very professional *** ******** I feel confident going to her for my treatments. She knows what she does and creates a warm friendly environment where she diligently treats patients by taking time and devotedly attending to them. She does not rush things up haphazardly to just cut short things and also does not come across as someone who'd fleece you for her benefit. I am glad with my treatment regimen with Dr. Madhumanti so far, and will continue to go to her for all my teeth related issues. Thanks a ton, doctor. And wish you all the best with your career as a dentist.",

She even agreed to come on her off day for the treatment. The RCT procedure was very smooth without any pain or discomfort, very unlike the experiences I have heard from my parents who have done their treatments elsewhere. Overall, I am satisfied and would highly recommend residents of Bangalore to visit The Tooth Story to solve their dental problems.",

First of all, the very first day of your consultation, the entire treatment plan was explained to you with their respective charges. Informed consent was taken from you before performing any procedure. You seemed to be very confused and anxious and that is why we had even asked you to come with your parents on the following appointments which you did not . I understand you had to wait in the reception area for 20 mins approx. but since on weekends there are lots of patients seeking appointments, we also expect a little patience from you. We have not suggested extraction for your upper tooth but only a filling. Extraction of upper teeth was suggested by some other clinic that you had visited to recheck on our treatments. Confusion happens when you visit multiple clinics and  get multiple suggestions, the result being nothing but increased confusions. Good to see that you have nowhere mentioned regarding the unimpaired healing that you had after undergoing a bony impaction surgery. Nowhere you had mentioned regarding the calls and messages that I have personally done to make sure that you are not having any discomfort after  surgery. \nAnyways, wish you good luck and good health.",

She is not upfront with the charges.You book appointment to get consultation from her, but some other assistant of her examines and reports to her. Then doctor listens to her and tells what to do. I went to see the doctor for tooth decay in the molar tooth, and asked her for a thorough examination of all teeth. I  waited for 45 min even though I had booked appointment. She hastily checked the tooth and asked for X-Ray to examine the tooth thoroughly. It was all fine till then. I was somewhat okay with her approach, and she seemed nice. After seeing the x-ray, she told she might have to extract the tooth and told the cost to be Rs 1000-2000. But after I got the tooth removed, I was asked to pay Rs 3500. WHY WAS I NOT INFORMED OF THE PRICE CHANGE EARLIER?? I felt deceived. I again went to see the doctor for a checkup few days after. WHY DID SOMEONE ELSE EXAMINED MY TEETH WHEN I HAD BOOKED AN APPOINTMENT TO CONSULT HER? Again her assistant examines the teeth, and tells that some other tooth has deep cavity and needs to be removed. WHY WAS A THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF ALL TEETH NOT DONE EARLIER?? That's it. I lost faith in her. Next day I went to see another famous doctor in Indiranagar. She examined the teeth thoroughly and told that I had a cavity in the tooth just above the one which was removed earlier. She told me that I should have got both teeth removed at the same time before only and suffered the pain only once. \n\nWould conclude by saying that the experience was really bad with Tooth Story Clinic and with Dr Madhumanti, as she could have done both surgeries together and I would have suffered less.",

I had a jaw pain (because of some surgery done 5 years ago). Due to this, I consulted my surgeon and he recommended to continue the RCT under his supervision. I couldn't continue my RCT treatment with doctor because of these complications. As I was helpless, I asked doctor to refund some of the amount from 4000 rs(which was taken at the start of the RCT). But the doctor refused to refund anything saying it's against their policies. I recommend people to think clearly before investing money here as in any case of emergency doctor won't refund anything. Even in big corporate hospitals money is taken per sitting / per treatment basis after treatment is done. And I believe in case of such emergencies they would also give it a thought about refund. \n\nAlso, I had called in the morning and booked appointment at 6.30pm, which was pushed to 7.30 by the assistant at around 6pm because of busy schedule. Then for the 7.30 pm slot, I had to wait for half n hour again because of busy schedule. Then I had the above discussion with the doctor for which she said that we could have talked over phone (for such critical matter) and not wasted her 1 hour of slot. But I had also waited for half n hour which the doctor did not observe. \nAlso, now after I have visited a dentist under the supervision of my surgeon says that the post in the tooth while doing the RCT is broken and thus the tooth cannot be saved as the post had become small and stuck in the root canal. Therefore, I have to now go for tooth extraction itself. \n\nPlease be very sure of your case and then only visit the doctor.\n\nThank you. ",

Doctor Madhumanti pointed it out and saved me the money. Highly recommended.",

She even agreed to come on her off day for the treatment. The RCT procedure was very smooth without any pain or discomfort, very unlike the experiences I have heard from my parents who have done their treatments elsewhere. Overall, I am satisfied and would highly recommend residents of Bangalore to visit The Tooth Story to solve their dental problems.",

Although my kid still did not open up completely, but she managed to get enough for an initial diagnosis and also prescribed necessary medicines. I am thankful to Dr. Madhumanti for being patient with my kid and handing his tantrums with such ease. \nShe also did not charge any exorbitant fee and she explained everything in detail and in advance.

He removed the wisdom tooth that caused the problem and removed the implant. After couple of months I had sever pain on other side. Rather than going to Narayana Hridayalaya, I decided to go to The tooth story. There doctor Madhumanti treated the pain. Also she looked at my problem in a holistic way. Most other clinics I visited till now,would look at the problems I complained. But Dr Madhumanti checked the complete denture and gave solution for everything. Also same Dr Prithvi who checked in Narayana Hridayalaya is also treating me here for implant. I also got my children's teeth checked up by Dr Madhumanti. I recommend her strongly.",

I was suffering from Tooth ache for couple of days and found the tooth story clinic from Practo. Based on the excellent reviews I made a choice to visit the clinic and I am extremely happy with the decision I made. Got treated for two RCTs in the same time frame and it was a painless experience as promised by the doctor. She gives individual attention by explaining what could be the problem and the most feasible solution for the same. The best part about her is she followed up with me on her own to see how I was doing. I haven\u2019t seen any Doctor showing so much concern about their patients. \n\nI would highly recommend all to visit toothstory if they want hassle free Dental Treatment and a special thanks to Dr Pragnya and the rest of the Support staff for the timely updates and assistance. \n",

While cleaning the decay, I had suggested to take local anaesthesia, but again u didnt allow me to do so\u2026 it is very difficult for us as doctors to treat such patients who donot listen to advise at all, come with preconceived ideas and if they suffer d consequences, then also blame the doctors \u2026 its a strange world .",

I had given you the option of either a conservative or an invasive treatment method out of which you had chosen to go for the conservative method. Conservative method is only removal of infected  part while keeping the affected part of the carious dentin undisturbed and filling up the tooth as of now. It has been clearly mentioned to you that in future if the tooth gets symptomatic, you have to go for a root canal treatment. \nBefore that day, you had come 3 times for the consultation and asked me the same questions. I had been very patient to answer your queries each time again and again and even now I will be happy to explain you for the 4th time as well. The rest I will leave on your comprehensive capability.\nGood Luck.",

As far as I recollect, Dr. Sireesha( 5 yrs exp.) checked your mouth thoroughly, listened to ur symptoms and then only decided to take an xray. Xrays are mandatory for proper diagnosis. That too, we don't charge for xrays unlike other clinics. You were given medications and were asked to come for treatment. We had given follow up calls later in the week to check how you are doing but you haven't picked up. We have tried our best to serve you but still if your are not satisfied, we would apologise for the inconvenience. \nRegards\nDr Madhumanti. \nSenior Consultant \nThe Tooth Story",
