The prima facie apparently rude behaviour of the doctor created a negative impression on me. So, I came back without listening to his advice. Actually, I should have listened. After few days, feeling acute chest pain and tightness in chest, I was compelled to be admitted in a reputed Heart Institute and carried out my Coronary Angiography and other tests in the same manner that was prescribed earlier. During my stay at that hospital, I found Dr.Kahalai talking well to his patients after their angiography and recommending them necessary medicines with careness. So, on 2nd thought based on my first hand experience, I would recommend Dr.Kahali. I am sorry for my initial review on that old man. He is surely an experienced doctor. ",

The prima facie apparently rude behaviour of the doctor created a negative impression on me. So, I came back without listening to his advice. Actually, I should have listened. After few days, feeling acute chest pain and tightness in chest, I was compelled to be admitted in a reputed Heart Institute and carried out my Coronary Angiography and other tests in the same manner that was prescribed earlier. During my stay at that hospital, I found Dr.Kahalai talking well to his patients after their angiography and recommending them necessary medicines with careness. So, on 2nd thought based on my first hand experience, I would recommend Dr.Kahali. I am sorry for my initial review on that old man. He is surely an experienced doctor. ",
