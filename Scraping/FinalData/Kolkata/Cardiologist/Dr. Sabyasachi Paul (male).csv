,"Electrocardiography (ECG),",0,0,YES,I had consulted Docter Sabyasachi Paul at B. M. Birla Cardiac Research Centre for my Father's heart problem. He advised us to implant pacemaker due to some conduction issue and describe us very clearly why it's obvious for us. He is very energetic and positive minded docter . My father is now recovering day by day after operation done by him and he had also appreciated this docter for his post operative care. We are very much satisfied and benefited by the service provided by B. M. Birla Cardiac Research Centre and Dr. Sabyasachi Paul. We wish him good luck. üôè,2021-09-23 12:00:16,False,True,Sonali Dey,,,
,,0,0,YES,I visited him for my mother's heart failure treatment. He is an amazing doctor and a doctor whom I consider an angel sent by God for my mother.He listens to your problems very patiently & is very down to earth.I would definitely recommend him for any heart related problems specially heart failure.The only negative thing I would mention is the waiting time required is sometimes more as he attends the OPD patients & IPD patients at the same time which is often more time consuming for patients as they need to wait.*** ******** ** *** ** ** **** ************* * **** ****** *********** *********** ********* ** *** ******** * always encourages to do lifestyle modifications along with the medications which is of utmost importance for being healthy.May God bless you doctor.,2021-09-10 06:22:13,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
