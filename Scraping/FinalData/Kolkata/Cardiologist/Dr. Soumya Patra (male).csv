,"Coronary Angiogram,",0,0,YES,"My home is in Alipurduar town in North Bengal.  My cousin had heart blockage, heart specialist Dr. Soumya Patra is a doctor I know.  So I went to Dr. Soumya Patra for treatment.  On the 9th of this month the doctor had an apartment.  Doctor Patra responsibly performed angioplasty on my uncle's heart on the same day and the uncle's surgery was completed very successfully.  I am forever grateful to Dr. Patra.  I must tell everyone that Dr. Soumya Patra is a very good heart specialist surgeon, moreover, his speech is very beautiful.  The family of any patient can safely trust Dr. Patra.  Thank you very much Dr. Soumya Patra
