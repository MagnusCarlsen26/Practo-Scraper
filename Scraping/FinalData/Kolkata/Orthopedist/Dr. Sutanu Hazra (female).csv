,,0,0,YES,He is a good doctor and too much familiar. He has operated my mother leg femur broken place and my mother is good. My mother is still his observation. I am really satisfied for his all type of support. After operation within month my mother was stabled and standing in the floor.  So I wish him long life and support all patients as usual. Thank you Sir.,2024-06-16 15:01:57,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
