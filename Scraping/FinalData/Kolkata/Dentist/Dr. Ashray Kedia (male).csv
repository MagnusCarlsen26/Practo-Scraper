"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Gap Closing,Orthodontic Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Can't thank Dr Aashray enough for the treatment. I am undergoing the treatment under him, to fill the gap between my teeth. There were multiple gaps and a few of them were huge. I got my treatment started in Bangalore right before Covid and could not continue after 2 visits. Moved to Kolkata, visited multiple orthodontists here and none seemed confident taking up my case, in fact a few of them suggested my braces were wrongly put hence they need to be replaced with a new set, another suggested my gums were too weak to hold the pressure hence I should get them removed and undergo a treatment to strengthen my gums first. Finally, I met Dr Aashray in October 2021 and the results are evidently positive. It just took 8 months to fill such huge gaps, the alignment looks fantastic. I highly recommended Dr Aashray for any dental treatment, not only he explains the issue well, he is also very disciplined with the entire process.
