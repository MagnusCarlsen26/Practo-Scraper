I have a 10 yrs old son whose milk teeth are not falling naturally but new teeth are coming out over those milk teeth!
He examined very carefully,made a plan and started executing immediately!The way he handled my son was just amazing !My son couldn’t get a chance to cry but he managed to extract two of his dangling teeth!My son had around 5 visits and by then half of his problems are gone!
On the other hand my father has been suffering from severe toothache.He visited many doctors but of no use! They  said nothing can be done and finally I took him to dr.Chandra!He found out infected areas with the help the of x-ray plate and drilled the tooth cap and started treating my father.After few days I got a call from my father and he was saying  that his pain has gone completely!I can’t stop crying seeing the relief in my father’s voice !
