"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"We went for the treatment of our daughter who is 3 years and 8 months old. She had multiple cavities in her teeth which needed dental fillings. We tried before with some other doctors but they could not even open her mouth. Then we came to know about Dr Abhirup Goswami and the result was just amazing. In a single sitting that too on our first visit,  he did the needful treatment and we were extremely happy with his behaviour too.
