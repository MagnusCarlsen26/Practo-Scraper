"Value for money,Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,",,0,0,NO,Very Terrible and too expensive and not worth ! Without informing  the patient They will charge extra and add the money in ur bill ! ,2020-02-18 07:48:54,False,False,Verified Patient,"Dear patient you did not report at the scheduled time. At the time you have reported I was performing an emergency treatment and I have personally apologised to you for being late. It is important to understand that we are working on patients and It may take some extra time than scheduled. You have reported to the clinic with pain in the wisdom tooth. Whenever wisdom tooth is involved bilaterally it is important that a full mouth radiograph is taken to check the proper position. Incase you did not want to get it done then you should have  informed us. Also my staff made an extra effort to email you the image at the same time since you were travelling. Of course when a radiograph is taken you will have to pay for the same. Incase you do not want to pay then it is advised that you inform the doctor because as a dentist it is our duty to make complete diagnosis and then only prescribe medicines. Moreover we charge only 500 INR for the radiograph where as anywhere else it is charged no less than 700 INR. It is very shameful to see that you are accusing the dentist when the dentist is billing for genuine consultation charge which are clearly mentioned on Practo. Suppose you do not want to pay for radiograph please inform doctor we can waive it off but if you have taken the image by email you will have to pay for it. It is also shameful on part of Practo to accept such feedback without knowing that no treatment per se has been rendered to the patient and only consultation for performed for which the fee is clearly mentioned on Practo.
It is very sad to see that patient has so negative attitude if doctors request for genuine fee of 1000INR ( 500INR consultation plus 500INR radiograph)  which is with radiograph which is mandatory to prescribe medicines.",2020-02-18T13:41:02+0000,Dr. Disha Agarwal
