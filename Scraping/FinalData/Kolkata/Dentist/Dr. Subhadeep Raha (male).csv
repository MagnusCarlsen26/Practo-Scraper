,,0,0,NO,Today I called the doc before visiting the chamber. He asked me that he is available. When I have visited the Chamber another lady doctor was available with her. I thought she is some assistant and she diagnosed everything. She wrote the prescription in the Doc Raha's pad only with her sign. It was not even mentioned that two doctors are available inside. Suddenly the fees was also hiked to 500. Overall this one was really bad experience. I didn't experience this. ,2020-11-07 13:08:59,False,False,Ankan,"This is in response to youre complaint..
