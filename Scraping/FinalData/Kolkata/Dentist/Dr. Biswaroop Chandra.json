They  said nothing can be done and finally I took him to dr.Chandra!He found out infected areas with the help the of x-ray plate and drilled the tooth cap and started treating my father.After few days I got a call from my father and he was saying  that his pain has gone completely!I can\u2019t stop crying seeing the relief in my father\u2019s voice !\nDr.is intelligent,young ,dynamic and highly skilled !",

They  said nothing can be done and finally I took him to dr.Chandra!He found out infected areas with the help the of x-ray plate and drilled the tooth cap and started treating my father.After few days I got a call from my father and he was saying  that his pain has gone completely!I can\u2019t stop crying seeing the relief in my father\u2019s voice !\nDr.is intelligent,young ,dynamic and highly skilled !",
