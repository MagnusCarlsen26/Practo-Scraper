Back then RCT was done and the lower half of my tooth was reconstructed but soon it started to discolour. Moreover my original tooth was rabbit tooth ( slight overlap on the central incisor). And what was reconstructed back then was quite a  weird shape! My doctor back then said this was all that could be done for me.This year i had consulted another dentist and he suggested tooth extraction and prosthetics. I was not up for any of it. \n       It was then i got to know about dr.aditi and anish bharti frm a friend. When i consulted them , they suggested that they will reconstruct the prosthetic lower half. I was particular about the shape, the colour and also stated i needed the procedure done within a span of a month. Within two weeks the entire procedure was done! First a temporary tooth was provided so that all my friends and family could decide whether it suited my smile. I was at my ease to decide over days whether i was happy with the shape or not( my previous doctor never gave a temporary tooth trial and had given me minutes to decide upon the shape of my permanent tooth). After four days i revisited dr.bharti and said i am happy with my tooth and i want the premanent one to be an exact replica. They took measurements and got the permanent one ready within the week. \n          The entire procedure was absolutely painless. Moreover xrays were done in the chamber itself saving me the trouble to run around for xrays and come back with the reports at a later date. All the instruments were sterilized before my eyes before they were used on me so that i could rest assured that i would not contract any infection. Both dr aditi and dr anish were extremely friendly, they listened patiently to how i wanted my tooth to look. Now i can say that i got my natural smile back after a span of seven years. And my friends cant guess which of my tooth is prosthetic actually because it is looks so natural. I will definitely recommend my friends to visit dr.bharti.thank you for designing my smile!",

Back then RCT was done and the lower half of my tooth was reconstructed but soon it started to discolour. Moreover my original tooth was rabbit tooth ( slight overlap on the central incisor). And what was reconstructed back then was quite a  weird shape! My doctor back then said this was all that could be done for me.This year i had consulted another dentist and he suggested tooth extraction and prosthetics. I was not up for any of it. \n       It was then i got to know about dr.aditi and anish bharti frm a friend. When i consulted them , they suggested that they will reconstruct the prosthetic lower half. I was particular about the shape, the colour and also stated i needed the procedure done within a span of a month. Within two weeks the entire procedure was done! First a temporary tooth was provided so that all my friends and family could decide whether it suited my smile. I was at my ease to decide over days whether i was happy with the shape or not( my previous doctor never gave a temporary tooth trial and had given me minutes to decide upon the shape of my permanent tooth). After four days i revisited dr.bharti and said i am happy with my tooth and i want the premanent one to be an exact replica. They took measurements and got the permanent one ready within the week. \n          The entire procedure was absolutely painless. Moreover xrays were done in the chamber itself saving me the trouble to run around for xrays and come back with the reports at a later date. All the instruments were sterilized before my eyes before they were used on me so that i could rest assured that i would not contract any infection. Both dr aditi and dr anish were extremely friendly, they listened patiently to how i wanted my tooth to look. Now i can say that i got my natural smile back after a span of seven years. And my friends cant guess which of my tooth is prosthetic actually because it is looks so natural. I will definitely recommend my friends to visit dr.bharti.thank you for designing my smile!",
