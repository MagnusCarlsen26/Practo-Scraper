After a thorough check-up by the doctor himself, we were informed that the tooth needed to be extracted. Since my father had a compromised medical condition, some blood investigations were advised. Once we got it done and was cleared by Dr.sourabh, he visited again for the extraction of the tooth. Notwithstanding the limitations of performing the extraction at home, the procedure was carried out effortlessly and with extreme precision. The treatment was painless and therefore comfortable. I would also like to add that the instruments used completely sterilized and packed aseptically. It was opened right in front of us to ensure complete transparency.
