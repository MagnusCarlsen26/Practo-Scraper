My daughter who cried in all the previous clinics, was so happy to talk to Dr. Anuj. Even the other staff members are very loving towards the child. They have kept a lot of stuff to keep kid's happy and occupied. The treatment was also well planned and nicely executed.While many previous dentists suggested root canal for my daughter without even properly examining the teeth(daughter was petrified to open mouth because of pretended friendliness of previous dentists) , but Dr Anuj examined thoroughly with patience and recommended capping and filling for the affected tooth. We went for several sittings but Dr. Anuj and his staff was always very kind, friendly and patient with the child. It was a painless , friendly and thorough treatment and we would highly recommend Dr. Anuj for any dental treatment. ",

He was crying alot and Sir pacified him and handled everything so patiently that now whenever we go he happily gets his treatment done. He is having lot of problem in his teeth, Sir always suggests a treatment which last for longer time. I remember my son doesnt use to sleep whole night due to toothache, got his pulpectomy done and its been 3 years now he is not facing any problem.  Thank you sir for handling my son and treating him.
