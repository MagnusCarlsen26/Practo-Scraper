As one of the reviews written for him helped me.\n\nI got his reference from senior doctor Dr.Mitra who is my uncle's friend.\n\nI would definitely recommend Dr Gupta for oral and maxillofacial surgeries.*** ** *** ** *** ***** highly educated, brightest student in his academic records, very much experienced and genuine doctors.\nNever suggests unnecessary treatments and unwanted cost of operations.\nAfter my 3-4 consultations with different well-known doctors. I finalized Dr Gupta and got trust on him in our 1st meeting only with no confusions.\n\nPrior I was scared with the treatment options I received from other doctors.\nIn my 1st visit only he helped me to understand my dental problem and all treatment options available in detail. He followed all procedure smoothly.\nHe made us very comfortable and explained proper treatment plan. I and my family members got inpressed with his clear vision on treatment plan.\n\nSpecial thanks to Pravisha who treated me in absence of Dr. Saurabh During my treatment I found that she is very punctual and calm in nature. She took proper  ownership of assigned work. \n\nBoth of them were reachable on text/whatsapp also for any queries that thing I found very helpful. My even a smallest queries got answered on text itself.\n\nI am grateful to you both, Saurabh, Dr.Pravisha and your team involved in my treatment.\nYour clear point of views, operation strategies, humbleness towards patients and proper guidance is most appreciated.\nThank you so much.",

Recently he had a severe toothache so visited the dentist near by who suggested that he must get the wisdom tooth extraction done ASAP which cannot be performed in clinic as he had critical issue related to blood loss (due to positioning of my tooth). So I found Dr. Saurabh on Google , practo and spoke to him immediately. He advised the full course of treatment and his expertise on the same, As he is a seasoned Doctor to handle spl. Cases like ours. The way he handled the complete process is deeply appreciated. He made himself available 24/7 as my father's condition was little critical. We thank him for his kind gesture and treatment provided throughout!!",

Since I was short on time, and Dr. Gupta is an expert, we were advised to remove all 4 wisdom teeth in a single surgery. The wisdom teeth were deeply seated in my lower jaw, but Gupta team was meticulous in removing all of them with precision. I did not experience any nerve related complications, swelling and my recovery has been swift and satisfactory. The doctor shared a very helpful guide to inform me about the care to be taken, which was highly detailed and very well curated. I highly recommend Dr. Gupta since I had a nice experience with my surgical procedure.",

I finalized Dr Gupta and got trust on him in our 1st meeting only with no confusions.\n\nPrior I was scared with the treatment options I received from other doctors.\nIn my 1st visit only he helped me to understand my dental problem and all treatment options available in detail. He followed all procedure smoothly.\nHe made us very comfortable and explained proper treatment plan. I and my family members got inpressed with his clear vision on treatment plan.\n\nSpecial thanks to Pravisha who treated me in absence of Dr. Saurabh During my treatment I found that she is very punctual and calm in nature. She took proper  ownership of assigned work. \n\nBoth of them were reachable on text/whatsapp also for any queries that thing I found very helpful. My even a smallest queries got answered on text itself.\n\nI am grateful to you both, Saurabh, Dr.Pravisha and your team involved in my treatment.\nYour clear point of views, operation strategies, humbleness towards patients and proper guidance is most appreciated.\nThank you so much.",

Since I was short on time, and Dr. Gupta is an expert, we were advised to remove all 4 wisdom teeth in a single surgery. The wisdom teeth were deeply seated in my lower jaw, but Gupta team was meticulous in removing all of them with precision. I did not experience any nerve related complications, swelling and my recovery has been swift and satisfactory. The doctor shared a very helpful guide to inform me about the care to be taken, which was highly detailed and very well curated. I highly recommend Dr. Gupta since I had a nice experience with my surgical procedure.",

My father has been on dialysis for a few years now which has adversely affected his stamina. Recently, he had complained of toothache and the affected tooth was mobile. I initially contacted Dr.saurabh on phone and explained him about the concern. He is an extremely humble person and was generous enough to visit my father at home. After a thorough check-up by the doctor himself, we were informed that the tooth needed to be extracted. Since my father had a compromised medical condition, some blood investigations were advised. Once we got it done and was cleared by Dr.sourabh, he visited again for the extraction of the tooth. Notwithstanding the limitations of performing the extraction at home, the procedure was carried out effortlessly and with extreme precision. The treatment was painless and therefore comfortable. I would also like to add that the instruments used completely sterilized and packed aseptically. It was opened right in front of us to ensure complete transparency. I am very thankful to Dr. Saurabh and his team for a skillful approach to address my father\u2019s concern.",

I read about his work and positive patient reviews on Google and I couldn\u2019t be more right in choosing him for my ALL on 4 implants procedure.\nAfter my CT scan was done, I was informed that I am a good candidate for All on 4 implants. Dr. Gupta took the extra efforts to explain me the entire procedure which made me feel involved in the process. This also alleviated my anxiety. My teeth that had gone bad were extracted and implants were placed on the same day. The procedure was so quick and I was home in less than 2 hours. I did not feel any pain after that day and was able to resume my daily activities. I got my permanent set of teeth few weeks later and I am so happy with it. My smile has never been better.I am really happy with the service at Dr. guptas dental clinic and plan on getting my wife treated here as well. I would recommend this clinic to anyone who is in kolkata and have teeth problems.",

Doctors are very professional and explained the treatment course thoroughly. Most importantly doctors has an excellent chairside manner and is very polite & friendly. So, even though it takes me over an hour to reach the clinic, it doesn't feel like a hassle and I am always at ease visiting the clinic. Doctors are very approachable also in case of any issue regarding the treatment. The braces part of the treatment is complete now and I'm very happy with the result. A lot of my family members visit Being dentist for their teeth issues and I would recommend to anyone looking for any kind of dental treatment.",

Dr pravisha with whom the consultation for my tooth extraction was done was different from the one who operated dr saurabh.\n2.Receptionist is missing on that day. \n3. Even though there was a very helpful note provided to me for post tooth extraction home care, one major point was missing.They did not mention not to use straws to drink because  it might cause bleeding - which is what happened with me. Please include this in the list of points to me mindful about after extraction. \nHaving stated the above, the procedure performed by the doctor Saurabh was seamless and the dr Pravisha was courteous and very helpful.\nWill recommend.",
