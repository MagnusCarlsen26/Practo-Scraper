The impact was such large it not only broke one of the front tooth but also it came out of the set.I was bullied in my childhood because of this uneven broken front tooth. I went to a few local and government hospitals but none could fix my teeth after several attempts. Slowly all the negativity and hatred went away, and the broken tooth became a part of me. Every now and then someone would make fun of my teeth, obviously I would feel bad and stop smiling. I was not proud of my smile.One day I heard about Dr Rupesh, and booked an appointment with him. When I met him, it  was probably 2-3 months before my marriage. Looking at my teeth he said, he is confident that he can fix it. I never felt so relieved. I did everything he said, and suddenly after around 2 months, he actually fixed it. I can never be more thankful to a doctor. He gave me my smile back! Words can't describe my emotions. I laughed like anything in my marriage and all of it was possible because of Dr Rupesh.Thank You Doctor.",

As it happens in Kolkata during Puja's, all dental clinics were closed and our sons Pedodontist was out of town. We were apprehensive of not finding a Pedodontist, but Dr Rupesh despite being an Orthodontist, handled our son quite well and put our fears at ease. He listened, examined and explained the pros and cons of the treatment very nicely. Dr Rupesh did the Composite Restoration with finesse and skillfully handled all the complaints of our child. He answered all our queries related to our sons dental management very patiently. The clinic Implanting Smiles is a relatively new 2 chair group practice with most dental specialties and young dynamic dentists. We interacted with the 3 dentists present during our visit and all of them were a pleasure to talk to. We felt the dental team had a consultative team approach to supporting the patient experience which we rarely see in the private sector. Finding it open on a holiday when most clinics had closed speaks about the clinics work ethos. The decor and feel of the clinic is also modern and aesthetic adding to the patient experience. Surprisingly we found the pricing to be cost effective too. Thank you Dr Rupesh and team Implanting Smiles. Kudos and all the best!!",

In 2018 end I consulted Dr Rupesh Singh who took up the challenge reminding that at this age it becomes difficult to pull the teeth back in position. It took some two years plus but the procedure was successful and she got back her smile. It was totally different experience from the old one which was somewhat painful but the technology used by Dr Singh was painless and hygenic. \nDr Singh is very friendly and he deserves my congratulations. \n",

I went to a few local and government hospitals but none could fix my teeth after several attempts. Slowly all the negativity and hatred went away, and the broken tooth became a part of me. Every now and then someone would make fun of my teeth, obviously I would feel bad and stop smiling. I was not proud of my smile.One day I heard about Dr Rupesh, and booked an appointment with him. When I met him, it  was probably 2-3 months before my marriage. Looking at my teeth he said, he is confident that he can fix it. I never felt so relieved. I did everything he said, and suddenly after around 2 months, he actually fixed it. I can never be more thankful to a doctor. He gave me my smile back! Words can't describe my emotions. I laughed like anything in my marriage and all of it was possible because of Dr Rupesh.Thank You Doctor.",

As it happens in Kolkata during Puja's, all dental clinics were closed and our sons Pedodontist was out of town. We were apprehensive of not finding a Pedodontist, but Dr Rupesh despite being an Orthodontist, handled our son quite well and put our fears at ease. He listened, examined and explained the pros and cons of the treatment very nicely. Dr Rupesh did the Composite Restoration with finesse and skillfully handled all the complaints of our child. He answered all our queries related to our sons dental management very patiently. The clinic Implanting Smiles is a relatively new 2 chair group practice with most dental specialties and young dynamic dentists. We interacted with the 3 dentists present during our visit and all of them were a pleasure to talk to. We felt the dental team had a consultative team approach to supporting the patient experience which we rarely see in the private sector. Finding it open on a holiday when most clinics had closed speaks about the clinics work ethos. The decor and feel of the clinic is also modern and aesthetic adding to the patient experience. Surprisingly we found the pricing to be cost effective too. Thank you Dr Rupesh and team Implanting Smiles. Kudos and all the best!!",

I had one impacted wisdom tooth and another non impacted one which had given me a lot of pain and difficulty for the last 3 years.  The Dental surgeon is really good at his work , he had performed the surgery taking all covid precautions and I was super satisfied with his mode of treatment. Not only myself, my parents are his dedicated patients too. Even they are happy with his work. I wish him all the best and highly recommend him to all \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d ",

He gave only one ointment. He told if pain doesn't control visit I will change the Crown. For this small thing he charged800 Rs. This is really too much for a small tooth problem .
