I felt no discomfort during the 5-minute procedure and I haven't had any cheek bites since. What's more, she discovered that one of my teeth had a cavity, something another dentist, whom I'd visited a few weeks earlier, had missed! Dr. Radhika filled the cavity and though I was expecting pain, I felt none. Also the filling material she used matched my tooth so well that when I was asked to check in the mirror, I couldn't tell which tooth had been worked on! It looks and feels absolutely natural. I also liked how she patiently answered all my queries before and after and explained the issues, possible solutions, and future actions in layman's terms and with easy to understand analogies. I liked the Dentotsav clinic as well. Everything on the premises looks neat and clean. The location itself is easy to find, especially on Google Maps. Moreover, the clinic has a very capable and polite staff. I was nervous before I got there but was made to feel comfortable as soon as I reached (Also, realizing that the clinic is equipped with the latest technology tools calmed my nerves further). All in all, it was a very satisfactory and pleasant experience (never thought I'd be using the word 'pleasant' to describe a visit to the dentist! :P). So, based on my visit and treatment, I believe that anyone seeking dental assistance would be in good hands with Dr. Radhika at Dentotsav. ",

But not with Dr. Radhika! She is so good that she even fixed a severe problem tooth which had been painful for about 2 years and for which I had been to so many dentists already!\n\nAs a gynecologist myself I can say that she has a fantastic work ethic. As a nervous dental patient I like how she explains everything really calmly and talks me through the procedure with a smile.\n\nIn the past I have had 2 completely painless root canals done by her. This time I got treated a for gap between my tooth which was causing food to be constantly stuck there, which led to cavities and toothache at the spot. I also got my broken front tooth fixed.\n\nI guess what I like most about her is that she is able to destress the whole dental experience for me, while being very, very good at what she does.",

I was also in excruciating pain for about 3 weeks. When it became unbearable, I went to Dentotsav. The choice was made on the basis of search made for dentists near my home on Practo.  Ms Radhika V Goel is a doctor who would break all your apprehensions we normally carry about a dentist. She listened to my problems patiently, clarified the position and status of my ailment in a very lucid manner, gave me all available options and then started the treatment. While working on my teeth, she would take care that there is no pain. During the treatment, whenever I had slight pain or whenever I felt uncomforted, I would raise my hand and she would immediately stop. Such is her level of care and empathy. I am seeing her for last one month and have been treated on three tooth. I still have  atleast two sessions left. I have had dramatic relief and things now seems great. Dentotsav is equipped with all modern facilities, machinery and equipments. Almost all teeth related problems are treated here. The clinic is cozy and nicely maintained, with hygiene, cleanliness of top notch. The way one is welcomed with a bottle of packaged drinking water, is amazingly comforting. It may hardly cost anything, but it gives you a warm welcome feeling. I would strongly recommend Dentotsav and Dr Radhika V Goel, for all teeth related problems.\n",

I felt no discomfort during the 5-minute procedure and I haven't had any cheek bites since. What's more, she discovered that one of my teeth had a cavity, something another dentist, whom I'd visited a few weeks earlier, had missed! Dr. Radhika filled the cavity and though I was expecting pain, I felt none. Also the filling material she used matched my tooth so well that when I was asked to check in the mirror, I couldn't tell which tooth had been worked on! It looks and feels absolutely natural. I also liked how she patiently answered all my queries before and after and explained the issues, possible solutions, and future actions in layman's terms and with easy to understand analogies. I liked the Dentotsav clinic as well. Everything on the premises looks neat and clean. The location itself is easy to find, especially on Google Maps. Moreover, the clinic has a very capable and polite staff. I was nervous before I got there but was made to feel comfortable as soon as I reached (Also, realizing that the clinic is equipped with the latest technology tools calmed my nerves further). All in all, it was a very satisfactory and pleasant experience (never thought I'd be using the word 'pleasant' to describe a visit to the dentist! :P). So, based on my visit and treatment, I believe that anyone seeking dental assistance would be in good hands with Dr. Radhika at Dentotsav. ",

But not with Dr. Radhika! She is so good that she even fixed a severe problem tooth which had been painful for about 2 years and for which I had been to so many dentists already!\n\nAs a gynecologist myself I can say that she has a fantastic work ethic. As a nervous dental patient I like how she explains everything really calmly and talks me through the procedure with a smile.\n\nIn the past I have had 2 completely painless root canals done by her. This time I got treated a for gap between my tooth which was causing food to be constantly stuck there, which led to cavities and toothache at the spot. I also got my broken front tooth fixed.\n\nI guess what I like most about her is that she is able to destress the whole dental experience for me, while being very, very good at what she does.",

I was also in excruciating pain for about 3 weeks. When it became unbearable, I went to Dentotsav. The choice was made on the basis of search made for dentists near my home on Practo.  Ms Radhika V Goel is a doctor who would break all your apprehensions we normally carry about a dentist. She listened to my problems patiently, clarified the position and status of my ailment in a very lucid manner, gave me all available options and then started the treatment. While working on my teeth, she would take care that there is no pain. During the treatment, whenever I had slight pain or whenever I felt uncomforted, I would raise my hand and she would immediately stop. Such is her level of care and empathy. I am seeing her for last one month and have been treated on three tooth. I still have  atleast two sessions left. I have had dramatic relief and things now seems great. Dentotsav is equipped with all modern facilities, machinery and equipments. Almost all teeth related problems are treated here. The clinic is cozy and nicely maintained, with hygiene, cleanliness of top notch. The way one is welcomed with a bottle of packaged drinking water, is amazingly comforting. It may hardly cost anything, but it gives you a warm welcome feeling. I would strongly recommend Dentotsav and Dr Radhika V Goel, for all teeth related problems.\n",

She is very welcoming and friendly, and has surely made me realize dental procedures can be accessible and hassle-free. She is really calm and completes her diagnosis and procedures by taking the time it needs and keeping patience with her patients! During procedures, she also explained to me each step, and that is wonderful because it kept me informed on my procedure! Her assistant is also really helpful, and they have been really helpful in scheduling and rescheduling my appointments whenever I couldn't be present due to work. Dr Goel's guidance regarding other procedures has also been helpful. And I'm definitely gonna come back for other procedures as well!\nThanks a lot Dr. Goel and Dentotsav team!",

In these difficult times while maintaining all protocol, Dr Goel completed my tooth extraction so well, that, not for a minute was I worried or tense. I would recommend Dr Goel without any hesitation and wish her and Dentosav all the best for the future. Well done and god bless.",
