Being the epitome of professionalism, Dr. Tiwari always took the time to thoroughly explain each procedure, making sure I understood it and felt comfortable.

You visited us with a severe infection in the wisdom tooth region, accompanied by noticeable facial swelling. We prescribed antibiotics and advised tooth removal. The antibiotics given were standard and necessary for your condition. It's important to understand that these medications need time to work, Patience is key for the medicines to take effect. We are doctors not magicians

Regarding your comment on my attitude and rude behaviour, I want to clarify that I do not enjoy being rude or stern with any patient. However, your behavior towards our staff was completely unacceptable. At Tooth and Braces, the respect and dignity of our staff are of utmost importance. We rely on our dedicated team to provide the best care possible. The way you spoke to our staff in the clinic and during subsequent phone call was highly inappropriate.

We wish we could share the call recordings of the conversations to provide context and clarity on the matter and to prove how the way you spoke was unacceptable. we wish there was a way to review verified patients just like they review us. Despite the challenges, we sincerely wish you good health and hope you find a dentist whose attitude meets your expectations.
