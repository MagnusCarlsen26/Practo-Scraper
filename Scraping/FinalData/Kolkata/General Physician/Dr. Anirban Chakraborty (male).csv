"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Diabetes Management,Type 2 Diabetes Treatment,",0,0,YES,"He is totally a different doctor. He prescribes the medicines, exactly what is required. He rather focuses more on Life style change. He makes patients understand the side effect of taking excess medicines. A Feel Good factor works after visiting him. His treatment is similar to treatment of developed countries. 
It is very sad that doctors in India do prescribe a lot of medicines. The patients fear to visit the doctor again. The doctors make patients feel worry for their diseases.

Dr Anirban Chakraborty can be visited for any disease except surgery cases.
Proud to have a doctor like him in India.
