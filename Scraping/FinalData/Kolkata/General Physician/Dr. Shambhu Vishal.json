                "review_text": "Dear Dr. Vishal\n\nAMRI Hospital\n\nSaltlake, Kolkata\n\nI would like to thank everyone at AMRI hospital, Saltlake, Kolkata; especially Dr. Shambhu Vishal(General medicine) and Dr. Ritam Chakraborty(pulmonologist) and the entire nursing staff. 15th of February 2020 I got admitted in the hospital with high grade of fever and cough. I was very weak and the irritating cough made me more agitated. I was suffering from cold, cough and low grade fever from past 15-20 days and its became neglected due to my work pressure. On the day when I have landed on Dr. Vishal\u2019s OPD, I never have heard his name before. Even I didn\u2019t get time to research the well known doctors in AMRI hospital. Once I entered dr. vishal\u2019s office with my wife, we saw a very young gentleman is welcoming us. By observing his age we were bit confused by thinking are we on safe hand, or does he has enough experience etc etc. Due to the lack of sleep and the irritating cough with high fever I was very restless. But his calm attitude, bedside attitude and knowledge gave me so much of confidence to go ahead with him. During my hospitalization he has visited me many times apart from his general rounds even at mid night. Also he has shared with me his personal mobile and whatsaApp number for an emergency. Moreover, during the hospitalization if any question arries in my mind after his general rounds I was asking him through whatsApp and surprisingly he was trying to explain one by one in very approachable manner. I feel a doctor apart from his clinical skill and knowledge; he should be friendly, approachable and should understand a patient\u2019s psychology. Then being a patient half of the illness will be solved.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s non-technical staffs were excellent and everything went like clockwork. This hospital is a class by itself and I would not now want to go anywhere else. Everything was so regularized and all my questions answered in a kind and friendly manner.\n\nThank you once again, it is wonderful to have hands that create miracles in other peoples live.\n\nkind regards\n\nKinshuk Bhunia(AM30066101)\n\nKolkata, West Bengal",

I actually had anxiety issues. After talking to him, he was really good. I can recommend doctor to my family or friends. I am satisfied with the explanation and treatment given. Patient usually expects how doctor speaks and treats him because medicines anyone can give but he listened well about my issue. It was my first consultation with him. I was quite happy and no discrepancy. I went to him as I had done blood tests and couple of routine health checkup from my office. I wanted to get second opinion, as I had consulted before dermatologist for skin allergy. I have shown the prescription given by dermatologist to Dr. Shambhu. Late he prescribed another medicines. ** ****** ***** It gave instant relief. I am having anxiety issues still as its lock down period. There was no waiting time in the hospital, it was only 15 minutes I waited. Hospitality was fine. I had low deficiency in vitamin, so he suggested tablets. ",

I was very weak and the irritating cough made me more agitated. I was suffering from cold, cough and low grade fever from past 15-20 days and its became neglected due to my work pressure. On the day when I have landed on Dr. Vishal\u2019s OPD, I never have heard his name before. Even I didn\u2019t get time to research the well known doctors in AMRI hospital. Once I entered dr. vishal\u2019s office with my wife, we saw a very young gentleman is welcoming us. By observing his age we were bit confused by thinking are we on safe hand, or does he has enough experience etc etc. Due to the lack of sleep and the irritating cough with high fever I was very restless. But his calm attitude, bedside attitude and knowledge gave me so much of confidence to go ahead with him. During my hospitalization he has visited me many times apart from his general rounds even at mid night. Also he has shared with me his personal mobile and whatsaApp number for an emergency. Moreover, during the hospitalization if any question arries in my mind after his general rounds I was asking him through whatsApp and surprisingly he was trying to explain one by one in very approachable manner. I feel a doctor apart from his clinical skill and knowledge; he should be friendly, approachable and should understand a patient\u2019s psychology. Then being a patient half of the illness will be solved.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s non-technical staffs were excellent and everything went like clockwork. This hospital is a class by itself and I would not now want to go anywhere else. Everything was so regularized and all my questions answered in a kind and friendly manner.\n\nThank you once again, it is wonderful to have hands that create miracles in other peoples live.\n\nkind regards\n\nKinshuk Bhunia(AM30066101)\n\nKolkata, West Bengal",

Patient usually expects how doctor speaks and treats him because medicines anyone can give but he listened well about my issue. It was my first consultation with him. I was quite happy and no discrepancy. I went to him as I had done blood tests and couple of routine health checkup from my office. I wanted to get second opinion, as I had consulted before dermatologist for skin allergy. I have shown the prescription given by dermatologist to Dr. Shambhu. Late he prescribed another medicines. ** ****** ***** It gave instant relief. I am having anxiety issues still as its lock down period. There was no waiting time in the hospital, it was only 15 minutes I waited. Hospitality was fine. I had low deficiency in vitamin, so he suggested tablets. ",
