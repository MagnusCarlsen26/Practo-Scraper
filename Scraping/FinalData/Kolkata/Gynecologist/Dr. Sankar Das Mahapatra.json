The pregnancy was complicated and my wife experienced early bleeding, and leakage in amniotic fluid. We were blessed to meet Doctor Sankar Das Mahapatra, who suggested us the timely medications and also the necessary tests required. He took care of the patient's health and of the baby's health too in the womb. Moreover he is very punctual and reachable. Whenever we felt certain problem related to the pregnancy symptoms, we called him, and he gladly received the calls and suggested the needful, and redressed our panic. This is also worth mentioning that when we paid him the last visit, and my wife complained that the baby's movement in the womb is not traceable, he immediately decided to do the operation in that night itself. Thanks to his timely decision, later the pediatrician said the amniotic chord was moving around the throat of the baby, and the timely operation has saved her from further complications. \r\nBesides being a great Doctor, his support crew is also very helpful. We found all the necessary information from his secretary Kali Da. He provided us information related to medicine suppliers, testing centers, and moreover as a friend he provided us the necessary ideas and thoughts and most importantly the courage to cope-up with difficult situations. The other assistants in the Millennium Clinic was also very helpful. \r\nIt is worth saying that we were fortunate to have such a doctor, and we suggest other would be parents to visit him, listen to his advice, and be fortunate to become a parent of lovely angels.",

On the other hand, in the year 2021 for my elder daughter delivery   I was under other doctor at Parkstreet neotia He took from me almost 1 lakh separate then sudden  2 days before admission for delivery, they checked and I was covid  positive. As He delivered under covid situation he charged again 1lakh and 20k for covid prevention like  gloves during operation.  These money I didn't paid in the hospital. These all I gave separate to him. Thankfully, in my second issue I changed my doctor to Mahapatra sir and I was really saved. He is so nice doctor and he had saved me! I recommend everyone. He is the best doctor. Surely you will be cured and he never charged any extra money. Even within 15days if you go for checkup after last checkup, he don't charge any fees.",

My wife's first pregnancy ended in unforeseen tragedy under the care of a highly reputed female gynecologist in Kolkata and our first child was still-born due to her poor judgement and indecisiveness in delivering the baby in time.  When my wife was pregnant again we were all very nervous but decided against going for fancy doctors in Kolkata. We chose Dr, Das Mahapatra instead and he calmed us down and took real good care of my wife. My wife has diabetes and hence her pregnancy is considered high risk. Dr. Das Mahapatra was decisive and operated on her during the 36th week itself and we had our little girl who filled our lives with unlimited love. Born a little premature, she had to stay in NICU for few days but everything else was fine. Currently she is a healthy 9 month old bundle of love and joy. I would highly recommend Dr. Das Mahapatra. He may not be the most fancy doctor in Kolkata but he is highly effective.",

The pregnancy was complicated and my wife experienced early bleeding, and leakage in amniotic fluid. We were blessed to meet Doctor Sankar Das Mahapatra, who suggested us the timely medications and also the necessary tests required. He took care of the patient's health and of the baby's health too in the womb. Moreover he is very punctual and reachable. Whenever we felt certain problem related to the pregnancy symptoms, we called him, and he gladly received the calls and suggested the needful, and redressed our panic. This is also worth mentioning that when we paid him the last visit, and my wife complained that the baby's movement in the womb is not traceable, he immediately decided to do the operation in that night itself. Thanks to his timely decision, later the pediatrician said the amniotic chord was moving around the throat of the baby, and the timely operation has saved her from further complications. \r\nBesides being a great Doctor, his support crew is also very helpful. We found all the necessary information from his secretary Kali Da. He provided us information related to medicine suppliers, testing centers, and moreover as a friend he provided us the necessary ideas and thoughts and most importantly the courage to cope-up with difficult situations. The other assistants in the Millennium Clinic was also very helpful. \r\nIt is worth saying that we were fortunate to have such a doctor, and we suggest other would be parents to visit him, listen to his advice, and be fortunate to become a parent of lovely angels.",

As He delivered under covid situation he charged again 1lakh and 20k for covid prevention like  gloves during operation.  These money I didn't paid in the hospital. These all I gave separate to him. Thankfully, in my second issue I changed my doctor to Mahapatra sir and I was really saved. He is so nice doctor and he had saved me! I recommend everyone. He is the best doctor.

My wife's first pregnancy ended in unforeseen tragedy under the care of a highly reputed female gynecologist in Kolkata and our first child was still-born due to her poor judgement and indecisiveness in delivering the baby in time.  When my wife was pregnant again we were all very nervous but decided against going for fancy doctors in Kolkata. We chose Dr, Das Mahapatra instead and he calmed us down and took real good care of my wife. My wife has diabetes and hence her pregnancy is considered high risk. Dr. Das Mahapatra was decisive and operated on her during the 36th week itself and we had our little girl who filled our lives with unlimited love. Born a little premature, she had to stay in NICU for few days but everything else was fine. Currently she is a healthy 9 month old bundle of love and joy. I would highly recommend Dr. Das Mahapatra. He may not be the most fancy doctor in Kolkata but he is highly effective.",
