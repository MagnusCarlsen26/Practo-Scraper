I have gone through your feedback. Your previous baby delivered under me one year back in CGHS rate at Charnock Hospital. Still you have used some offensive words against me without knowing the actual fact. No issue. That might be your nature. 
I think i should clarify few things. 

Firstly: My Consultation fees in my private chamber is not 700 (Too much), you should better ask your wife. Even i didn't take any fees from your wife during last visit . Don't you know that?  

Second: Hospital authority has full right whether they will admit CGHS covid patient or not. Doctor has no right . They can only treat the patient. 

Third: Ask your wife, she know why i told her to get admitted. Opinion may vary from doctor to doctor. Nothing is universal. 

Lastly:  I don't know where you get the figure 6.5lacs. I do LSCS of Covid patient at Charnock Hospital regularly.  Cost is maximum one fifth of your quoted amount. 

(N.B: Check any hospital bill. You will get the information how much a doctor get out the bill amount)

If you really want to criticize me , it is welcomed.  But don't fabricate the truth.

Cons: He charged more for normal delivery than Caesarean section as he has to stay more time in hospital.
