"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,",,0,0,YES,"*** ****** *** ** *** ** *** **** **** ************* ** ********I visited with the doctor in Saltlake AMRI Hospital.It would be wrong to call him only a doctor, he is a magician. He has magic in his hands, he did my total Laparoscopic hysterectomy operation as if by touching a magic wand, I didn't feel any pain. Biplab sir speaks so well that the patient will be half cured just by talking to him. I am giving a review after 10 days of operation.I havn't had any problems since discharge from the hospital. Biplab sir's team Dr. Somnath sir and Dr. Sagnic sir are very careful, their behavior is also very good, they always come and see me before and after surgery. Overall great experience and satisfaction with the doctor Biplab Deb and his team.",2023-08-11 15:30:29,False,True,Sk Mahua Islam,,,
