She is a thorough professional, but has a personal touch while tending to patients. What I appreciated most about her was that she was straight us and provided clear answers to all questions.\n\n*** ******** ****** ** **** ** **** She takes more time to listen to her patients, than any other doctor I have ever seen. She is thorough, intelligent and welcomes patient questions with thorough answers.\n\nEven during the covid times, She ensured she attended to every patient and all necessary precautions were in place.\n\nThank you so much for taking care and giving me the best service possible.",
