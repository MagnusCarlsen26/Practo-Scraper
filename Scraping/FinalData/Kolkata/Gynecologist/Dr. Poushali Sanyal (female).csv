"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Social Obstetrics and Gynecologist,",0,0,YES,"Starting from pregnancy, during delivery and even after delivery, Dr. Sanyal has given tremendous support, continuous guidance, motivation and superb confidence in bringing our child in this world safe and healthy. Along with her in-depth expertise and knowledge, her kind and helping nature always made me and my wife feel that we are in safe hands. She listens to us patiently and never gets tired in answering to any of our questions (be a bland one or a serious one :))

I must recommend to visit her if you really need proper guidance and help in your maternity/paternity journey.
