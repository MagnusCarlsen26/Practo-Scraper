I remember I calling her in pain amidst her surgery which she informed, and I continued to tell her how painful and anxious I was , instead of hanging up on me, she took a minute to explain that things with me were normal and she would call back after her surgery. and She did call me back in the night to check how I was doing!! \nShe was not alone focusing on treating my physical pain with tablets but also studied my emotions  when considering the option on treatment plan. She helped me take things slow, take things right and kept herself with me even when she was too tired. SHE IS A DOCTOR, A TRUE ONE, that wants to treat people more than anything . ",

However the way doctor treats patients is really superb. I am very happy for the same.\n\nAs the problems of gynecology will be very private, patient would speak to doctor only after they get the confidence in doctor. In this case doctor speaks very polite and listens to patients. She keeps up good time to speak to her patients and understand the problems. She is a patient friendly doctor as well.\n\nWhen it comes to my problem doctor has diagnosed and given me few medicines. After completion of the medicines course, i got cured by my problem. The cure was very quick and effective. I am very happy for the way she treated me.\n\nThe clinic is very well maintained with the best facilities. The consultation fee of rupees two hundred fifty is also not much compared to other doctor. I would happily recommend this doctor to other patients.\n\nThanks a lot to doctor Anuradha for the best treatment.\n",

She showed me a ton of empathy and sensitivity for some of the tough issues I was facing and made me feel reassured that I was in good hands with a dr who was going to carefully monitor my health condition.\n\nClinic  is also good and nicely managed  staff behave nicely with the patients. Overall i am fully satisfied with the dr.",

I got fed up in waiting.i have also noticed. patients who are coming after me are allowed to meet doctor before me. I checked with staffs in what order they are sending patient.., but did not get proper response. finally I felt very bad in waiting and walked out. they stopped me and allowed me to meet doctor immediately. so I think. they have to improve the wait time of patients. we are not able to meet doctor on the appointed timing. this leads to complete dissatisfaction.",

I remember I calling her in pain amidst her surgery which she informed, and I continued to tell her how painful and anxious I was , instead of hanging up on me, she took a minute to explain that things with me were normal and she would call back after her surgery. and She did call me back in the night to check how I was doing!! \nShe was not alone focusing on treating my physical pain with tablets but also studied my emotions  when considering the option on treatment plan. She helped me take things slow, take things right and kept herself with me even when she was too tired. SHE IS A DOCTOR, A TRUE ONE, that wants to treat people more than anything . ",

However the way doctor treats patients is really superb. I am very happy for the same.\n\nAs the problems of gynecology will be very private, patient would speak to doctor only after they get the confidence in doctor. In this case doctor speaks very polite and listens to patients. She keeps up good time to speak to her patients and understand the problems. She is a patient friendly doctor as well.\n\nWhen it comes to my problem doctor has diagnosed and given me few medicines. After completion of the medicines course, i got cured by my problem. The cure was very quick and effective. I am very happy for the way she treated me.\n\nThe clinic is very well maintained with the best facilities. The consultation fee of rupees two hundred fifty is also not much compared to other doctor. I would happily recommend this doctor to other patients.\n\nThanks a lot to doctor Anuradha for the best treatment.\n",

She showed me a ton of empathy and sensitivity for some of the tough issues I was facing and made me feel reassured that I was in good hands with a dr who was going to carefully monitor my health condition.\n\nClinic  is also good and nicely managed  staff behave nicely with the patients. Overall i am fully satisfied with the dr.",

I got fed up in waiting.i have also noticed. patients who are coming after me are allowed to meet doctor before me. I checked with staffs in what order they are sending patient.., but did not get proper response. finally I felt very bad in waiting and walked out. they stopped me and allowed me to meet doctor immediately. so I think. they have to improve the wait time of patients. we are not able to meet doctor on the appointed timing. this leads to complete dissatisfaction.",

I came here to check my general reproductive health to Dr. Anuradha mam and she was absolutely amazing that she explained me each and every thing which gave so much confidence about my health and wellness. She hears the problem so patiently and suggest the apt medication which can suit my body. I will highly recommend to visit Dr. Anuradha. Thanks a lot Mam for checking me thoroughly. I will give 5/5 for her treatment and service she provided. Everyone in her clinic was so polite and humble. Thanks a lot.  ",
