,"Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"** **** ** *** **** ************ ***** I found out that I was pregnant after completing 3 months of pregnancy and have consulted Dr Sura mam at Rainbow Hospital Shollinganallur since then! 
Tensed? Worried? Panicked? 
The moment you see her smiling face it will vanish. She will give you complete positivity that your baby is fine.  
I had bit high sugar levels from my 7th month due to which my water levels had increased. She suggested me to cut down sugar and asked me to check sugar every week. She then suggested a diet and inspite of diet my sugar didn't come down only then she started tablet for me. 
I had no pains till 39th week. Since my sugar was high and she wanted me to have normal delivery she suggested to induce labour in 39th week and 3 days. 

Special mention about her before and after my labour. Since it was my first pregnancy, I was super scared and due to which heart rates of me and my baby were high. All she told me was not to worry, it's a natural process and asked me to relax and go with the flow. 

I was 4cm dilated at 10:30 pm and doctor rushed to the hospital after that. 
She patiently waited for me to be 10 cm dilated, gave me strength and kept motivating me. During the pushing stage she encouraged me to breathe in breathe out and asked me to push when the pain started. She gave me complete support.  Since my baby wasn't coming out she tried to pull her with vacuum  pump . After trying twice my baby didn't come out. She didn't give up and tried again after which my baby came out safely at 3:05 am.
I had a safe and normal delivery all credits to Dr Sura mam.

After my stitches process was done , doctor made sure to come and check on me by holding my hand and Since I was emotional, I poured my heart out to her and she patiently listened to me and consoled me and started to her home at 5 am. 

Really the best gynecologist ever! 
Pregnant? Trying to get pregnant? Go to her with complete faith. She will take care of the rest! Highly recommend all ladies to go to her!
