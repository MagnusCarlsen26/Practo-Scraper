 I have a very pleasant and life changing experience with my doctor.Here is my story.I had my first baby miscarriage in 60 days so I was depressed and stressed and mentally weak. Physically I had a lot to undergo like irregular periods and mental stress. So I decided to go for a doctor's consultation and at the first meeting the doctor gave me confidence and medicines and gave some morale boosting advice which helped me recover from my first trauma.
        Her medication and treatment made me better and I was able to get back normal.
        No other doctor could be as friendly as she was. Jayashree madam easily understood my health and mental status as well.
        Her fees are according to market and there is no overcharging. I can call or message her at anytime and she is there for me. When she's free at clinic she laughs and enjoys with her patients. she attends phone call of patients,in case mam is busy,she will call back asap. Nowadays no doctors talk on the phone with patients.but she is kind and friendly. 
         Every time I meet mam, she keeps telling ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry ,just stay positive and keep your mind free, everything will be fine‚Äù.Her postive thoughts and encouraging words made me feel strong.i am so blessed to find Dr. Jeyashree mam in this corner of earth. Whenever I get an appointment with doctor, I never waited too long for consultation. Also, Dr. Jeyashree mam takes time to talk to me, clear all our doubts no matter the no of patients waiting for consultation.
         My husband and I decided to go for a baby and the doctor gave good planning and advice and also some medication.By god's grace I got pregnant again and  From then our journey started with the doctor more frequently.
      I believe more than the medicines, it‚Äôs the positive energy and the encouragement helped me keep away the fear about the miscarriage again.
      Treatment wise Dr. Jeyashree mam has prescribed me what I actually need. The scan facility in the clinic is the added advantage. The Consultation fee and the Scan charges are very very reasonable compared to what other hospitals charge. She gave complete confidence and positivity to forget the initial trauma and I gained confidence and we visited the doctor every month. Everything went well with doctors advice . I followed everything well. Every checkp doctor gave diet charts personal advice and medication.Doctor fees is normal and affordable. She prescribed only limited medicine. 
       On 22feb I got labour pain and visited doctor she advised to get admitted in hospital. She gave me the confidence and
She treated me as her own child.With half an hour she came to Rainbow hospital and did a complete normal delivery for me.
    All thanks to the jayashree mam kept on motivating me.i am really thankful to her for my successful and beautiful pregnancy journey.I m so much thankful and grateful for rest of my life. I recommend this doctor to everyone .

Being diabetic I was being treated gingerly by most hospitals that asked me to find an expert gynecologist to remove my uterus since I was diagnosed with adenomyosis and had already had C-sections.
Dr. Jayashree was a god-sent savior who had a no-nonsense clear-headed approach to the medical issues at hand - giving me a week of insulin shots recommendation to bring down the sugar levels so that the surgery could be carried out.
What speeded up my recovery from the expertly conducted laparoscopic surgery - hysterectomy, ovary (with cyst) removed that wasn't spotted earlier, and hernia (again not found previously in diagnostic checkup) patched up - was THE LOVE AND PERSONAL ATTENTION provided.
Last but not the least I was required to be hospitalized for just two days (one day prior and on surgery day) at Sunrays Laparascopic Centre, Ashok Nagar.
I vouch whole-heartedly for the professionalism of Dr. Jayashree Sharma and loved the whole experience of getting back to hale and hearty!
