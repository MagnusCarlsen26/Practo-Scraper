Dr.Karthiga Devi ensured that I had a smooth pre-op,surgery and follow up. She ensured that I had good physical and mental health post surgery.She gave her utmost care.Her attitude and approach towards me was very soothing. Post surgery, I keep a good health.

Dr. Karthiga had helped me a lot during my toughest situations and provided a great assistance and full support when I became pregnant again! As mine was marked as a high risk pregnancy, she took extra care of me, never failed to answer my calls during emergency situations, offered 24/7 support, and above all, she helped me deliver a healthy baby through normal delivery! Such a sweet and caring person one could ever see in the medical field! I feel thankful to her everyday I see my child! Thank you for everything you have done ma\u2019am!

From our initial visit till our post delivery visits she took good care of my wife and guided us throughout her pregnancy. She was so friendly and caring. She would clarify all our doubts(even silly ones) and spend ample time with us. We had our pregenancy post covid -19, in these troublesome times she gave us advice for a safe pregnancy.  She guided us very well at every trimester by explaining in detail all the  dos and  don'ts , diet and exercise. My wife's normal delivery  was possible because of her guidance. She is one of the most dedicated doctor answering all your queries and visiting patients at the hospital whenever needed. I would suggest her for anyone looking for a good caring gynaecologist at chennai.",

Dr.Karthiga Devi ensured that I had a smooth pre-op,surgery and follow up. She ensured that I had good physical and mental health post surgery.She gave her utmost care.Her attitude and approach towards me was very soothing. Post surgery, I keep a good health.

From our initial visit till our post delivery visits she took good care of my wife and guided us throughout her pregnancy. She was so friendly and caring. She would clarify all our doubts(even silly ones) and spend ample time with us. We had our pregenancy post covid -19, in these troublesome times she gave us advice for a safe pregnancy.  She guided us very well at every trimester by explaining in detail all the  dos and  don'ts , diet and exercise. My wife's normal delivery  was possible because of her guidance. She is one of the most dedicated doctor answering all your queries and visiting patients at the hospital whenever needed. I would suggest her for anyone looking for a good caring gynaecologist at chennai.",
