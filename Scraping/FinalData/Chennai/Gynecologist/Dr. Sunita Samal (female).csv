,,0,0,YES," We met Dr. Sunita Samal at apollo women's hospital 1st week of August 2023 and she has been referred by my family Doctor Muthulakshmi for my wife uterus fibroid removal, before that I was consulted more than 10 doctors. Since uterus fibroid size is 12 cm, she was suffering a lot of pain and bleeding, many days was nightmare for us and lost sleep.
 All doctors had insisted us to do open surgery because of bigger size and not having confident with laparoscope but Dr. Sunita Samal is the first doctor given confident that can be removed by laparoscopy.  So we fix the date on 21st August after the complete medical test.  Dr. Sunita Samal did surgery without any issue, am giving this review after 3 months now. my wife is completely fine and no other complication regarding her health.
