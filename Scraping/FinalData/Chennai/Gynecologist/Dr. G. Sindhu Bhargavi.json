She was so positive providing proper guidance and suggesting recommended treatments wherever required. Especially during my 3rd trimester had complications with AFI, HB level and this was treated properly by continuous monitoring. She clarifies all my queries in specific my husband's queries without any negligence and made us confident for delivery. During the last trimester advised for continuous checkup so that we are held up with critical situation. Due to the constant review, support and care I delivered girl baby normally. We are really thankful to her. ",
