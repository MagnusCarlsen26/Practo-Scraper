From initial pregnancy confirmation till delivery she was very supportive and guided us very well. my pregnancy journey was very smooth and happy only because of her. She won't recommend unnecessary clinical visits or scans.  We are very thankful to Sharadha mam and special thanks to Sneha mam. She is very friendly and cool person. She gave a lot of labour advice and suggested pregnancy exercises.The clinic atmosphere is also very good and clean.

She took the time to understand and go through the history and suggested a few tests with which she determined the underlying cause was anovulation. She let the cycles go naturally for the first 2-3 months and then prescribed what can help in ovulation. With that, we were pregnant by the end of 2021 naturally but due to certain reasons, there was a miscarriage. After a relaxation period both physically and mentally, she helped us try again and I'm writing this when I'm 2 months pregnant, and hoping I'll thrive by the remaining pregnancy phase. She has been sweet, very supportive, available on WhatsApp to answer our queries. There's absolutely nothing negative that neither my husband nor I have for we went back to her post a mishap too. Someone you can trust and follow. ",

She heard  all my doubts & queries and gave a clear advice throughout all my pregnancy checkups and visits. Mostly she will try for a normal delivery and she will not unnecessarily put in to Cesarean section. Her treatment & advice took me to a delivery of my healthy baby. Her guidance on post maternity care, breast feeding & advice on contraceptives was good & satisfied. We are happy & satisfied with her consultation & treatment through out my pregnancy & delivery. I thanked god for showing such a great & kind hearted gynaecologist. Thank you.",
