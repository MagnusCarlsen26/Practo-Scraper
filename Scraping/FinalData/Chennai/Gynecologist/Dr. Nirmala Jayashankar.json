The treatment and consultation was going fine for almost an year and my wife's situation reached a stage where her condition deteriorated and we met the Dr. and she was of the opinion that surgery could no longer avoided and she will fix a date after a consultation after a month and asked us to come on a specific date from her monthly cycle. in the mean time, the cycle time approached and with that my wife had some severe symptoms and we tried to approach the Dr over a call. we could not connect with her or any person from her team. After about 5 calls and lot of persuasion, we could reach out to someone in labor ward of the hospital and she advised if the situation is worse, we could come and get admitted in the emergency room.\n\nAs advised, we reached the emergency room and informed the nurse that she needs to inform the Dr and her team about our emergency. However, to our surprise the nurse in the ER was very lethargic and wanted to avoid us and after a lot of follow up, she asked us to go to labor ward itself which was on a higher floor. we did reach the labor ward on our own and tried to explain our situation to the nurse in labor ward. To our surprise, the nurse there was angry on us as to why we came there and not to the Emergency Room. we still requested here to put us in touch with anyone from Dr NJ's team or at the least inform her as she was aware of our medical condition. But to our surprise we were shown the way for ER and no one in the hospital was ready to help.\nI then decided to seek a consultation from our family physician for the emergency and immediately we had to consult a new gynecologist *** *** * **** *** ******* ** ******* ********.\n\nIt was sad that Dr's become so unreachable for patients that even in times of emergency they cannot be reached absolutely. whatever the emergency may be. Is this the way we should be handled and treated ? On the part of the hospital, why was there no one attending in the ER room and the moment a patient with an emergency walks in, is it a standard procedure to let the run from one ward to another ??",

The treatment and consultation was going fine for almost an year and my wife's situation reached a stage where her condition deteriorated and we met the Dr. and she was of the opinion that surgery could no longer avoided and she will fix a date after a consultation after a month and asked us to come on a specific date from her monthly cycle. in the mean time, the cycle time approached and with that my wife had some severe symptoms and we tried to approach the Dr over a call. we could not connect with her or any person from her team. After about 5 calls and lot of persuasion, we could reach out to someone in labor ward of the hospital and she advised if the situation is worse, we could come and get admitted in the emergency room.\n\nAs advised, we reached the emergency room and informed the nurse that she needs to inform the Dr and her team about our emergency. However, to our surprise the nurse in the ER was very lethargic and wanted to avoid us and after a lot of follow up, she asked us to go to labor ward itself which was on a higher floor. we did reach the labor ward on our own and tried to explain our situation to the nurse in labor ward. To our surprise, the nurse there was angry on us as to why we came there and not to the Emergency Room. we still requested here to put us in touch with anyone from Dr NJ's team or at the least inform her as she was aware of our medical condition. But to our surprise we were shown the way for ER and no one in the hospital was ready to help.\nI then decided to seek a consultation from our family physician for the emergency and immediately we had to consult a new gynecologist *** *** * **** *** ******* ** ******* ********.\n\nIt was sad that Dr's become so unreachable for patients that even in times of emergency they cannot be reached absolutely. whatever the emergency may be. Is this the way we should be handled and treated ? On the part of the hospital, why was there no one attending in the ER room and the moment a patient with an emergency walks in, is it a standard procedure to let the run from one ward to another ??",
