"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Wait time,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Before we start to mention success story and high accolades for Dr. Kanimozhi - AK Fertility + Apollo Cradles (and her well-established, well-wishing team like para-medic staff, scan experts, Pharma-distributors etc.,) in our Gynaec treatment journey,

I like to talk of our experience of overcoming a crisis in our 1st pregnancy - where my wife went thru' a miscarriage in her 6th month during the testing times in Covid 2.0 lock-down. While the most-painful moment of our life 'baby-expelling' happened, later my wife had to fight for her own life with a heavy/non-stop bleed - during when Dr. Kanimozhi stayed (strong) with her and accompanied her throughout that 1 hour at night,  pro-actively prepared us for all that was required to stabilise her (like blood collection in stock, para-medics). As we were sleepless on that dreadful night, Dr too seems to have continuously been checking with the clinic for continued nursing care through out that night. That's the moment we felt like an extended family with Dr and team - when someone cared us so deep in that distressed hour - taking us through our 'recovering moments' after a storm. 

When people around us, at that moment, cursed the Dr and hospitals/procedures as lapses - we knew in our hearts about what struggles that the Dr and team had to go thru along with us in such situations, - we did keep everyone in our prayers for their good deed and saving us thru' the crisis and unprecedented miscarriage event for all. 

NOW the good part of transformation ! 

We pursued treatment after 1yr break and here now my wife is pregnant in her 20th week - this time we are blessed 'doubly'.

We thank God and God-sent Dr Kanimozhi and her team for recreating this beautiful moment. We have always admired at her sharp memories and caringly  remembering important dates and medical reports that reflected as personal care beyond any Dr normal duties and paved way to this turn-around !! 

It's more reassuring for us now and a reminder that ""life goes on, whatever happens - just to believe, and move on spreading love, care and affection all over. Count your blessings everyday"" ...  


Bowing with respect, love and loads of gratitude to you Dr Kanimozhi + AK Fertlity and Apollo Cradles team - Hearty wishes and prayers for your continued dedicated service, care and successfully 'treating' the needy ones and your noble journey to transform people's lives ....  and May your family and dear ones be blessed !!
