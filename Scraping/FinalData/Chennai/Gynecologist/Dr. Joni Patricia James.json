I started consulting with her from my 7th month and she was a pillar of strength and support right from the start. She encouraged me a lot for normal delivery and made sure even though I had a long labour to wait and motivate me instead of going for other interventions. She\u2019s available to answer queries and she goes above and beyond to provide quality patient care. Would 200% recommend visiting her!",
