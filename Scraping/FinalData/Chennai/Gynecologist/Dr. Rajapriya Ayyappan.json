I beleive HR role is to look after staff payroll not poke their nose into others privacy. She is not fit to be in Hospitality industry or else hospital name might get spoil because of her behaviour. 5 Star was reduced to 4 star because of her rude behaviour and conversation with my mother-in-law.",

She\u2019s clear, confident in her communication and easy to approach kind of doctor. She answers most of your questions with adequate amount of patience and has a good sense of humour to knock you down for super silly questions. My wife Narmadha had natural birth and we have a beautiful angel in our arms. I would always be thankful to such skilled doctors. \nCons - Admin staff has to improve a lot in terms of their work, ability, speed and accuracy.  Pricing is decent and affordable. \n",
