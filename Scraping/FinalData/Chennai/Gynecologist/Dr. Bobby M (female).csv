An excellent, and friendly doctor.  She explained all aspects of the surgery and related procedures in detail.  We consulted her in her clinic (Prime Ortho and Shoulder Clinic) and in Apollo Cradle, but for getting better OT facility, she scheduled the surgery to be conducted at Apollo Hospital, Perungudi.  She coordinated with Apollo Hospital to book the OT and other required facilities and did the surgery at Apollo Hospital.  She has been of immense support to me , all along the treatment.  She was always available for discussions and to give us all guidance.  Because of the kind of care she provided, we felt like we were dealing with a family member.

There are no words to thank the doctor, for whatever care & support, that she has been giving to me all along the treatment. I would 100% recommend Dr. Bobby M.
