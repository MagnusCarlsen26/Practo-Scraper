We chanced upon Dr.Havila and setup a video consulting session. She was available within the next few minutes and guided us on what had to be done next. We got my wife admitted in easymom clinic. Dr.Havila was in constant touch with the caregiving team even though the admission was done close to midnight. The diagnosis, treatment and care given was fantastic. I would highly recommend both Dr.Havila and the easymom clinic to anyone.",
