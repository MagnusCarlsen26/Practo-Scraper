Throughout my Pregnancy her goal is to ensure I enjoy the period without panicking abt anything that came our way. Gestational diabetes, short cervix & what not - we didn\u2019t spend any money for unnecessary scans, suture treatments bcoz mam knew what is to be done. I delivered normally in minimal time & she was right there giving tips to overcome the contractions & her family of docs helped me deliver baby without csec. We spent in lacs for first pregnancy in another reputed hospital & suffered in several ways. For second pregnancy, we have been blessed & forever grateful to indhu mam throughout & her sister & mom support in labor ward. Such a gem of  doctors with no other intention other than taking care of patients genuinely. Strongly & highly recommending Indhu mam & Maaya nursing\u2019s Home kolathur. ",

I got extremely happy with the doctor's friendly nature and followed up with her till my delivery. I had no problem throughout my pregnancy but at the time of labor baby's heartbeat was high and it didn't come to normal. The doctor still wanted to wait and check if the heartbeat comes back to normal. As it still didn't subside, the doctor made an effective action to rupture the amniotic sac and gave me gel to induce labor and the baby's heartbeat was normal. I delivered my baby girl normally. I appreciate Dr.Inthu's effective action and thought process! ",

She wasn't even ready to listen to all my queries and just asked me to take a blood test. After I took the test and shared the results with her, she simply gave me a prescription without addressing any of my concerns.I had already shared the prescription I am currently taking for low iron. Even though the results showed that my iron levels had increased, she didn't tell me whether I should stop taking it or continue. Additionally, she prescribed a high dose of vitamin D. Most pharmacies said it was a high dose and didn't have it in stock. I finally bought it from one pharmacy and took it in the morning.I experienced severe stomach burn, pain, and continuous dysentery in the evening after I took the vitamin D tablet in the morning, leading to a two-day hospital stay. I suspected the dose might have upset my stomach and asked the doctor to clarify. I was allowed to ask 30 follow-up questions, with a promised response time of 24 hours. I just asked two questions\u2014one on June 22nd and another on June 24th. It's been 8 days, but I still haven't received any response. It feels like the amount I paid was wasted. ",

I would say she is the best gynecologist I have ever seen because she knows very well that I need surgery for fibroid uterus because it was 3 kg in size and it was very much trouble for me but she gave me full encouragement and I had complete confidence in going ahead to a surgery and she successfully did the operation and I am Hale and healthy now I am very much thankful for the doctor throughout my life",

Throughout my Pregnancy her goal is to ensure I enjoy the period without panicking abt anything that came our way. Gestational diabetes, short cervix & what not - we didn\u2019t spend any money for unnecessary scans, suture treatments bcoz mam knew what is to be done. I delivered normally in minimal time & she was right there giving tips to overcome the contractions & her family of docs helped me deliver baby without csec. We spent in lacs for first pregnancy in another reputed hospital & suffered in several ways. For second pregnancy, we have been blessed & forever grateful to indhu mam throughout & her sister & mom support in labor ward. Such a gem of  doctors with no other intention other than taking care of patients genuinely. Strongly & highly recommending Indhu mam & Maaya nursing\u2019s Home kolathur. ",

She wasn't even ready to listen to all my queries and just asked me to take a blood test. After I took the test and shared the results with her, she simply gave me a prescription without addressing any of my concerns.I had already shared the prescription I am currently taking for low iron. Even though the results showed that my iron levels had increased, she didn't tell me whether I should stop taking it or continue. Additionally, she prescribed a high dose of vitamin D. Most pharmacies said it was a high dose and didn't have it in stock. I finally bought it from one pharmacy and took it in the morning.I experienced severe stomach burn, pain, and continuous dysentery in the evening after I took the vitamin D tablet in the morning, leading to a two-day hospital stay. I suspected the dose might have upset my stomach and asked the doctor to clarify. I was allowed to ask 30 follow-up questions, with a promised response time of 24 hours. I just asked two questions\u2014one on June 22nd and another on June 24th. It's been 8 days, but I still haven't received any response. It feels like the amount I paid was wasted. ",

I would say she is the best gynecologist I have ever seen because she knows very well that I need surgery for fibroid uterus because it was 3 kg in size and it was very much trouble for me but she gave me full encouragement and I had complete confidence in going ahead to a surgery and she successfully did the operation and I am Hale and healthy now I am very much thankful for the doctor throughout my life",

When we searching gynaecologist in madhavaram and gynecologist in redhills and hospitals near by this is the only hospital we found best for pregnancy care and the same.\n\nThe hospital and doctors are fullfilled our thoughts especially Dr. Inthu was taking at most care from very beginning and humble nature and knows how to interact with patients. Due to covid 19 we were unable to continue pregnancy care in between but continue in the last trimester and followed proper instruction of Dr. Inthu. Till final day of delivery they were very kindful and taking care of us during delivery time \nOver all fully satisfied with Maaya hospital",
