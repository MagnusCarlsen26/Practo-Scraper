When I was told I was going to see a different doctor, from the one I had seen in previous years to relay the test results, at first I was hesitant. I was used to an elderly, **** ************* ****** ******. A young male? It took some encouragement from the nurses . They were full of praises for him. And so I went in.\n\n Dr. Abdul is not only obviously very qualified, but also knows how to break down complex info into very simple bits which anyone can understand. \nHe explained my results. They had found an echogenic lesion in my endometrium. He explained very simply that I needed a hysterescopy and endometrial biopsy done and went ahead to explain what I needed to do, and where I needed to go. \n\nAfter the procedure was done, and results had come in, he gave my husband and I a very clear explanation of the results  and reassured us that it wasn't anything to worry about, but that all I needed was to do check ups. **** ******* ** ******* ** ** ******** ******** ** *** ******* ***** **** ****** ** ** ******* ** ** * ************* \n\nWe were blown away by the Standard of Ethics he maintains, his professionalism and absolute care for me. I can now see why he is so popular. \n\nDr. Abdul Basith, sir, God bless you. \nI have recommended you to all my friends and look forward to my next check up with you on 2022.",

When results came out, I discovered that I had fibroidal growths in my uterus, and because my symptoms and physical makeup were peculiar, he suggested that I get a hysterectomy done to be relieved of pain and excessive bleeding I was going through every month. A few other doctors had the same opinion and after much hesitation, I had my surgery 9 months back done by Dr. Basith and am extremely happy to say I have been pain free ever since. He has been an absolute godsend because his skillful diagnosis and treatment saved me a lifetime of pain and suffering, so I'll recommend him to anyone looking for expert care, analysis and treatment.

When I was told I was going to see a different doctor, from the one I had seen in previous years to relay the test results, at first I was hesitant. I was used to an elderly, **** ************* ****** ******. A young male? It took some encouragement from the nurses . They were full of praises for him. And so I went in.\n\n Dr. Abdul is not only obviously very qualified, but also knows how to break down complex info into very simple bits which anyone can understand. \nHe explained my results. They had found an echogenic lesion in my endometrium. He explained very simply that I needed a hysterescopy and endometrial biopsy done and went ahead to explain what I needed to do, and where I needed to go. \n\nAfter the procedure was done, and results had come in, he gave my husband and I a very clear explanation of the results  and reassured us that it wasn't anything to worry about, but that all I needed was to do check ups. **** ******* ** ******* ** ** ******** ******** ** *** ******* ***** **** ****** ** ** ******* ** ** * ************* \n\nWe were blown away by the Standard of Ethics he maintains, his professionalism and absolute care for me. I can now see why he is so popular. \n\nDr. Abdul Basith, sir, God bless you. \nI have recommended you to all my friends and look forward to my next check up with you on 2022.",

When results came out, I discovered that I had fibroidal growths in my uterus, and because my symptoms and physical makeup were peculiar, he suggested that I get a hysterectomy done to be relieved of pain and excessive bleeding I was going through every month. A few other doctors had the same opinion and after much hesitation, I had my surgery 9 months back done by Dr. Basith and am extremely happy to say I have been pain free ever since. He has been an absolute godsend because his skillful diagnosis and treatment saved me a lifetime of pain and suffering, so I'll recommend him to anyone looking for expert care, analysis and treatment.
