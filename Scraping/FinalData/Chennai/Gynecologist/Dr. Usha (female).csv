"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Cervical Cerclage,",0,0,YES,"Sorry for the long post. 
I'm writing this success story with heartful of joy and happiness as we are blessed with baby boy today after going through tough phase. Initially we had visited the clinic back in late 2020 for follicular study, my wife had few minor complications after following medications within 3-4 months pregnancy test turned out to be positive, due to pandameic we shifted to one of the leading hospitals in the city right  from 8 weeks of pregnancy. Things were all good till 15 weeks, suddenly my wife started bleeding and when we rushed to the hospital she was diagnosed with Cervical incompetence, this could easily diagnosed during NT scan(12 weeks) by measuring cervix length but for some reason they didn't and nextly my wife was treated with Cervical enclarage on 15th week and within next 10 days she had preterm labour pain and Group of best gynaecologists couldn't save 16 weeks baby boy as it was too early. 

We took a break for few months for recovery and visited Usha mam she was shattered hearing the loss,because mam had put tremendous effort for it. But she gave us good mental support and after follow her medication my wife turned to be Positive within 2 months of Follicular study, but this time we were more worried and feared thinking of previous experience but right from week 2 mam was very supportive and helped us in all the way to cross initial 3 months and she also did Cervix stitch procedure with proper co-ordination. Surgery went well and regular follow-ups made. Mam gives individual care and special attention not only to us for all the patients. Mainly mam is easily reachable through What's app to answer all your queries. ** *** ** ******** *********** **** *** ** *** ****** **** ****** **** ************** ** ****** ********* this comparison is only to let others know the standard of treatment provided her. As a happy father, I'm pleased to answer your queries if any write to me * **************************",2021-06-16 09:07:12,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
