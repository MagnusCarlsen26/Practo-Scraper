If u have any injury in knee you can visit him without any hesitation.. Fracture required immediate attention with right person.. So don't make delay it will make complicate things.. I would've visit him early (before 21 days of injury) but I didn't That's why I am sharing my experience here.. Even though he done best in my case..

I met with accident on 15th Feb 2020.. Got ACL injury and a fracture in right knee.. I had several consultatiins with other orthopaedic surgeons who are not specialised in this arthroscopic surgery.. one of them misdiagnosis my injury.. after 1 month I came to know this surgery should be done by arthroscopic specialist and met with Dr.Billy sir.. During covid 19 lock down time also he supported me very well.. He patiently explained the condition of knee after seeing CT and MRI scans.. He will patiently answering our questions and doubts..He is Professional.. Down to earth person.. Nice human being.. His care towards patient is excellent.. I never seen this kind of doctor.. Moreover he is specialised in Sports medicines and Arthroscopic surgery.. so if u have any injury in knee you can visit him without any hesitation.. Please don't make delay..Fracture can't wait it required immediate attention with right person..
