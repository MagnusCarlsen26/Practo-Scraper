She had AF, urinery infection  & her ESR was very high. Most of the surgeon I counselled has not recommend for surgery with such High Risk condition & Age . My mother had a frozen Knee one day where she could not walk, Dr Arun took the Risk by having Necessary Back up & conducted surgery on the Right Knee successful which was frozen. \nMy mother has recovered & with the confidence Dr Arun has given we replaced second retrofit kit in left knee as well , Now she is happy since the pain she had has completely gone off. Thanks DR Arun for giving me the confidence & a great outcome as per your recommendation.",
