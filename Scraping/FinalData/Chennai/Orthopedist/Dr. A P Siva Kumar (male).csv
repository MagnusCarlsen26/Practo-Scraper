"Wait time,Value for money,","Wrist problems,",0,0,NO,"Not even a Star for this place .. Highly not recommended uwill not be able to claim even 1 rupee if u have insurance.. 

No GSTN number. **** ** **** **** ******* *** ** **** ** ***** When ased for name on xray they are writing the name on xray sheet with white Pencile. 

When asked for system generated bill . Receptionist says even then GSTN number will not be provided .  

Patient had a broken ankle and the staff at the reception says to wait as there are OP patients in que for consultation.  A patient with emergency situation is asked to wait in que ?? The receptionist is very rude and unprofessional.. No proper planning .. Doctor takes care of patients and comes out in middle for taking xray himself..

Expensive place..
