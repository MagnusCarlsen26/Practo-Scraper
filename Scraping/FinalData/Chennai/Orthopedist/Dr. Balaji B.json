He was always accessible and answered to our doubts and questions that we had throughout her treatment.

Dr. Balaji was part of the senior doctor team who performed the surgery successfully. We are really happy about the honesty and transparency in communicating the complexity , guiding us through the entire medical process, probability of success and the care which was shown to my father pre, during and post surgery which I could not have got anywhere else. It is really difficult to find good hearted  doctors like Dr.Balaji. Post surgery care was really awesome and the confidence that they instilled with the patient and family was awesome. I am so happy that Dr.Balaji has moved from Vellore to Chennai as a consultant in Medway, Nungambakkam. ",

Dr. Balaji was part of the senior doctor team who performed the surgery successfully. We are really happy about the honesty and transparency in communicating the complexity , guiding us through the entire medical process, probability of success and the care which was shown to my father pre, during and post surgery which I could not have got anywhere else. It is really difficult to find good hearted  doctors like Dr.Balaji. Post surgery care was really awesome and the confidence that they instilled with the patient and family was awesome. I am so happy that Dr.Balaji has moved from Vellore to Chennai as a consultant in Medway, Nungambakkam. ",
