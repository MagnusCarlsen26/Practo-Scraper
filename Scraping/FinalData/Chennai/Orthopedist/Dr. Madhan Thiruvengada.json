Due to an accident, I had very complex tibial plateau fracture and Dr Madhan did the surgery.  Though it was a complex fracture, with his expertise Dr Madhan treated it very well. Within 2 months I almost became normal and able to walk without any assistance. \n\nHe has lots of patience and was always available to clarify my doubts (with a smile) in a friendly manner during the course of rehabilitation. Finally I would say that I am fortunate to undergo surgery by Dr Madhan and always grateful to him.",
