,"Ligament and Tendon Repair,",0,0,YES,Consulted Dr. Aghilavendan ortho for ankle ligament tear. He was very kind and understanding. He analysed the problem completely and advised what was required. I would definitely recommend him for any ortho problem. The hospital was also well maintained. Everyone performed their job good. Right from security to all the staff. Even pharmacy staff were good. Only thing could be improved is to add more staff at the billing desk. And the seating area was a bit congested. Everytime 5 new patients were standing near the desk.,2023-07-15 12:08:59,False,True,Askiya Fathima,,,
,,0,0,YES,"I fell from my motorcycle on Sunday 22nd Jan 24 and felt I could not bear pain, my wife daughter rushed me to Apollo.Specialitu Hospital Vanagaram, at emergency xrays were taken of thigh and pelvis, a fracture was noticed in thigh bone. Within about 20minutes an Ortho specialist was brought in. He was Dr Aghilvendan,he explained the xrays patiently and said a surgery was necessary immediately to fix with screws. I was convinced by his depth of expertise,humility and  temperament and agreed immediately. Surgery was done on23rd around 12 noon and post mobilisation discharged on 24th. Overall though an unfortunate access sent, the right choice of specialist Dr Aghilvendan and a very dedicated courteous and skilled team, I am able to narrate this.God Bless Dr Aghilvendan and his team and Apollo Vanagaram for their skilled services round the clock.
