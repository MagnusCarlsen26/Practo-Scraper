Dr Muralidharan said he would happy to meet or speak with the Oncologist to explain about the patient's condition and his assessment once we let him know who and when we would visit the Oncologist. When I called on his mobile, at a relatively short notice, to let him know about our Oncologist appointment, he immediately answered the call and since we were going to another Apollo hospital where Dr Muralidharan was going to perform a surgery, he said he would quickly drop by to meet with the Oncologist. As promised he arrived before our appointment and took time to explain to the Oncologist about the patient. Later in the afternoon he called to follow up with us. Dr Muralidharan was totally professional in his approach and was very clear in explaining the situation/diagnosis which was easy to understand. Despite being highly qualified, well experienced and a specialist, Dr Muralidharan was very kind and supportive. Thank you so much doctor for your kind support and great experience. ",

My first contact with  Dr.Muralidharan made me completely blown away by how helpful and kind he was and how fast he was at getting back to find solution for the problem.\nNow on the appointment, it ran on time,  Dr.Muralidharan *** ****** ************* ** ***** *** ***** ******* ****** *** made me feel comfortable throughout the appointment\nComing to the main picture, I had a severe leg pain and was unable to walk even a single step, consulted few medical college professors and leading orthos in the city but none could  help me to sort out the issue. Most of them advised pain killers for temporary relief. \nBut when I visited Dr.Muralidharan spine surgeon at Chennai Ortho and Spine Center, Adyar he took time and carefully analysed and found out the underlying issue, it was a compressed sciatic nerve that was causing severe pain on my thigh while walking. He explained the whole problem taking time and also advised the practical dos and donts that I need to follow to avoid the problem in future. \nHe advised me few physio exercise and vitamin tablets, I recovered 80% the very next day and within a week I was able to do my routines and other tasks regularly.\nOne of the best thing is, he is extremely knowledgeable and dedicated and is not money motive. He charges a very reasonable cost for the care and service he offers. He takes time for each patient until finding the underlying cause and solution for the same.\nIf you are looking for a doctor whose medical knowledge is encyclopedic, treats the whole person, and takes the time to be caring even while maintaining a very efficient office, then Dr.Muralidharan is the right person\nI would definitely recommend him to anyone that values their health and find the solution for the spine and ortho related issues.\n",

Dr Muralidharan said he would happy to meet or speak with the Oncologist to explain about the patient's condition and his assessment once we let him know who and when we would visit the Oncologist. When I called on his mobile, at a relatively short notice, to let him know about our Oncologist appointment, he immediately answered the call and since we were going to another Apollo hospital where Dr Muralidharan was going to perform a surgery, he said he would quickly drop by to meet with the Oncologist. As promised he arrived before our appointment and took time to explain to the Oncologist about the patient. Later in the afternoon he called to follow up with us. Dr Muralidharan was totally professional in his approach and was very clear in explaining the situation/diagnosis which was easy to understand. Despite being highly qualified, well experienced and a specialist, Dr Muralidharan was very kind and supportive. Thank you so much doctor for your kind support and great experience. ",

My first contact with  Dr.Muralidharan made me completely blown away by how helpful and kind he was and how fast he was at getting back to find solution for the problem.\nNow on the appointment, it ran on time,  Dr.Muralidharan *** ****** ************* ** ***** *** ***** ******* ****** *** made me feel comfortable throughout the appointment\nComing to the main picture, I had a severe leg pain and was unable to walk even a single step, consulted few medical college professors and leading orthos in the city but none could  help me to sort out the issue. Most of them advised pain killers for temporary relief. \nBut when I visited Dr.Muralidharan spine surgeon at Chennai Ortho and Spine Center, Adyar he took time and carefully analysed and found out the underlying issue, it was a compressed sciatic nerve that was causing severe pain on my thigh while walking. He explained the whole problem taking time and also advised the practical dos and donts that I need to follow to avoid the problem in future. \nHe advised me few physio exercise and vitamin tablets, I recovered 80% the very next day and within a week I was able to do my routines and other tasks regularly.\nOne of the best thing is, he is extremely knowledgeable and dedicated and is not money motive. He charges a very reasonable cost for the care and service he offers. He takes time for each patient until finding the underlying cause and solution for the same.\nIf you are looking for a doctor whose medical knowledge is encyclopedic, treats the whole person, and takes the time to be caring even while maintaining a very efficient office, then Dr.Muralidharan is the right person\nI would definitely recommend him to anyone that values their health and find the solution for the spine and ortho related issues.\n",

Then we came to know about Dr. Muralidharan Sir, we visited sir at COSC, he gives optimum time and explains everything in simplest way possible..his confidence gave us positive hopes, finally sir did surgery at apollo hospital 1 month back and my brother is recovering well. Best part is, unlike others sir takes care of patient even after surgery till full recovery and hence post-op follow up is very easy. Sir is always available to clear if we have any doubts. Our experience with sir was beyond expectations..Thank u so much Sir for ur immense help in our tough times",
