At that time my best friend suggested Dr.Refai .My wife explained the ailment overphone.She was very much impressed about the the doctor's guidance . We discharged from madurai and proceeded to chennai for treatment. I had breathing problem and fainted continously. His findings through Echo, CTand Doppler revealed thrombus in lung and left leg. Without any delay (around 10.45 pm) , Dr. rang us and informed that this could be cured with injection and medicine. I am undergoing treatment. From then i am getting improved day by day. I feel secured  in safe hands of the best Dr, i never (ever)met. Being a Doctor, He (Dr.Refai ) is a man of simplicity. His patience in explaining the path of treatment made us strong. Great, he is not only a Dr, he is a God to save our life. ",

When I was brought to the operation theatre, I was totally nervous. But, it is Dr.Refai who stood by me and withered away all my fear. His consoling and optimistic word made me feel that nothing bad will happen to me. Dr.Refai indeed is wedded to his profession as a Cardiologist, working round the clock, unmindful of money, prestige, power, etc., He gives ample guidelines to avail insurance coverage facilities. He is calm and relaxed while he is consulting or giving treatment. I have never seen him getting angry. He took all possible medical efforts (next to God) to give me a new life. I shall remain thankful forever for his dedicated service. May God bless him abundantly.",

I feel secured  in safe hands of the best Dr, i never (ever)met. Being a Doctor, He (Dr.Refai ) is a man of simplicity. His patience in explaining the path of treatment made us strong.

My first contact was with Dr. Refai Showkathli and I was completely blown away by how helpful and kind he was and how fast he was at getting back to me! A lot of doctors don\u2019t realize how important it is to have administration like Him. The first point of contact is crucial!\nNow on to the appointment\u2026 my appointment ran on time, Dr Refai was really knowledgeable and made me feel comfortable throughout the appointment! I would highly recommend this medical group. I was completely taken care under his knowledge on the whole treatment.",

When I was brought to the operation theatre, I was totally nervous. But, it is Dr.Refai who stood by me and withered away all my fear. His consoling and optimistic word made me feel that nothing bad will happen to me. Dr.Refai indeed is wedded to his profession as a Cardiologist, working round the clock, unmindful of money, prestige, power, etc., He gives ample guidelines to avail insurance coverage facilities. He is calm and relaxed while he is consulting or giving treatment. I have never seen him getting angry. He took all possible medical efforts (next to God) to give me a new life. I shall remain thankful forever for his dedicated service. May God bless him abundantly.",
