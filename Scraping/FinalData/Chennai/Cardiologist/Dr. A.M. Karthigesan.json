But thing which I don't like is doctor receiving phone calls often.  But it's unavoidable since all calls are about doubts. Up-to mY knowledge no personal calls. \nI also consulted Dr.  Sujatha.  She is also very good.  Satisfied. \nFor doctor and treatment I'll give five star. \n\nI'll give one star for hospital employees and maintenance. Everywhere big queue. Today only I'm going first time to Apollo.  I'm new to Apollo hospital.  So that I don't know any.  I asked guidance. They directed me wrongly.  Highly disappointed. Also they are not caring patients well. In main block inside lab I think diabetic counter is there.  I'm not sure about this name.  Employees in that place treated us badly. They didn't took BP test for my dad and said its not their duty. They said I have to go another place near bill counter.  That's OK.  But their way of speaking is not good.  Finally they took BP. Mean time One employee saying to another employee \"you first send them to somewhere\". That guy tone of voice is very very bad...  I hate that.  We are paying money for treatment.  **** *** ******** **** ******** They asked to go nurse assessment room to take BP.  After reaching there that nurse asked to go doctor place.  They will take BP...  This is one of my experience.  Like this I faced few more things. \n\nI will give 5star rating for one employee from lab counter 2 main block.  I respect his timing help.  I don't know his name.  He only directed me correctly. ",

Next day inside OT I saw him again and he came near me and holding my hand said,\"don't panic I am here with you\". It's a wonderful relaxation I experienced. He then operated upon me and all the time gave me solace and confidence. I left myself to those trusted hands and today I am fine. Dr.Karthigesan is the God in disguise. He is polite, humble and a wonderful doctor. May God give him long long life so that he could give others long life.",
