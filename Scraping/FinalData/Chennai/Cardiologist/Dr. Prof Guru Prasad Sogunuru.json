After hearing this he asked to take all the tests and also made sure that I am relaxed and not having any tension. He did not prescribe any medication for high cholesterol as all other results were normal, I was very happy and had a big relief. Treating patients is not a big deal making sure the patients is relaxed, comfortable is more important and we will get a good dose of both with Doctor Guru. \n\nThanks a lot Doctor, it would be good if you take Practo video consultation for quick reviews if any, just a thought!",

After hearing this he asked to take all the tests and also made sure that I am relaxed and not having any tension. He did not prescribe any medication for high cholesterol as all other results were normal, I was very happy and had a big relief. Treating patients is not a big deal making sure the patients is relaxed, comfortable is more important and we will get a good dose of both with Doctor Guru. \n\nThanks a lot Doctor, it would be good if you take Practo video consultation for quick reviews if any, just a thought!",
