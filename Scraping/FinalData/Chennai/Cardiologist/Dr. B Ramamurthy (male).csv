,,0,0,YES,"I underwent CABG - 4 Grafts, in MMM Hospitals Chennai. Dr.Cherriyan has done the Surgery on 06-04-20000.I used to go for cardio checkup,every year.  
I am running 81 years of age & No problems so far.
I consulted Dr,B.Ramamoorthy,after taking ECG & Echo on 12-01-21,for
the variations in my BP. He made small changes in my medicines & advised to
come for Review  after 10 days with some medical tests, suggested by him.
I am thoroughly,satisfied with the treatment given to me by the Dr. in the OP.
