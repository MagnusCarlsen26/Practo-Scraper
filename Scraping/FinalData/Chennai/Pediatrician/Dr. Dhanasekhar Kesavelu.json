                "review_text": "Well it would take sometime for me to put together my experience. My son has cow's milk protein allergy. This was diagnosed only by Dr. Dhanasekar and none of the other doctors did. He used to posset too much after feedings and the most experienced doctor whom I was consulting (Dr. N. Srinivasan) in mylapore advised me to give domstal between every feeds without having the idea of what my son was actually suffering from. When I approached that doctor to suggest an alternate formula milk for my son, since I had to resume office after maternity break, he suggested to give aavin milk in a diluted form. When I tried this without knowing the underlying cause of my son's excessive possetting, he had severe bouts of vomiting and became drowsy...we rushed him to the doctor and he diagnosed and said my son has to admitted and given IV and if the vomiting doesn't subside he said a scan needs to be taken for further diagnosis. I was in an utter shock but by God's grace my son recovered automatically after the milk was digested. He put my son on another formula and when we tried that again the same scary vomiting episode. This time the doctor was very cool, asked me to give him domstal and try another formula. He would have prescribed almost all the formula milks available in the market to try one after another. Also my son had itchy rashes around his eyes which is a very typical symptom of CMPA (which I wasn't aware that time) and when I asked that doctor, without even examining he gave a very quick answer that it is a birth mark. The possetting episodes never stopped and I was not at peace and hence started researching and found all about this allergy and was again researching on a good doctor who would treat this kind of infant problems. and that's When I found Dr. Dhanasekar and he has to be thanked a million times. When we first time walked into the clinic he doctor at the very look of my son said he is suffering from CMPA and he put me on an elimination diet ie a diet free from milk and milk products first and observed a few days and eliminated some more stuff which could be causing the allergies and thereafter my son's possetting and eczema (rashes around his eyes) started curing off. A big thanks to Dr. Dhanasekar for his services. He is a boon to the medical industry. He spends ample time for each patient and he is a passionate pediatrician. A doctor who matches international standards. A great doctor really.",

We all have that feeling/experience/impression when we meet and interact with someone for the first time, and I believe that it's more than enough to testimony for them and the impression which doctor left is remarkable.

I personally feel the doctor is in a hurry to complete the consultation or to see the next patient. He cooly said to watch his youtube videos for all diet related content, I didnt want to see videos as I am only interested in personal consultation for my kid. I paid fee of rs600 and travelled far to see him for personal Q and A and answer some anxious queries regarding food for my kid. This not the right way to approach any patient. **** ************** * ***** I wanted to see the doctor and not for watever so called his youtube videos. I wrote some 10 questions as a homework to ask him, but the way he responded and in a hurry to finish off the consultation, I couldnt ask my queries and got upset with this behaviour. It would be good if the doctor sees the patient in a rite way and give personalised and customised consultation to every kid. *** *** **** *** *** **** *** **** ******* **** *** ***** ** ***** **** * ***** **** ****** *** **** ***** *** ********** *** ** ********",

Usually, most of the experienced/popuar doctors spend hardly 5 minutes with the patient and don\u2019t spend quality time. But Mr. Dhanasekhar Kesavelu is an exception in this. Even if the patient is silent, he probes and makes the patient ask doubt and get it clarified. \nSure to continue consulting him for my daughters. Will definitely refer him to others. \n- Hussain. ",

The most difficult part for any doctor is to build a rapport and get the patient /parent to build confidence on himself/herself and understand their/their childs illness better and abide by the doctors treatment and recommendations. Any ethically practising doctor like me will not be want to called as \"commercialised or business oriented\" and in public forums one has to mind the language before placing any allegations like this. If you had read the board,I have clearly said that 'I practice paediatrics passionately and the child comes first and always\" and I have also said to speak in front rather than speaking on the back. Its sad that you are unaware that there are a lot of people who come to meet the doctor ( NOT ONLY PATIENTS!) hence there are uninvited people whom i have to attend to like bankers,sales people and etc etc who are also humans and I have to greet them to with a smile! long Waiting times is not unusual for any busy doctor and I have clearly said that emergencies will be attended to ASAP. I hope you find one of my colleagues who will be able to attend to your needs and see you ASAP and who sticks on to their values.\n\nI will be very happy to discuss this in my clinic with a prior appointment and we can sort things out in a more easier way.",

She continuosly suffers from nasal block and cold. And doctor keeps changing medicines which is in vain. Also he keeps a board with rules that says, how he gives inportance to child care and accepta walk in. But he never follows a single rule out of them. He would like to call his friends and bankers( yes, he called in bankers during patients time and that too with babies crying all over)....

                "review_text": "Well it would take sometime for me to put together my experience. My son has cow's milk protein allergy. This was diagnosed only by Dr. Dhanasekar and none of the other doctors did. He used to posset too much after feedings and the most experienced doctor whom I was consulting (Dr. N. Srinivasan) in mylapore advised me to give domstal between every feeds without having the idea of what my son was actually suffering from. When I approached that doctor to suggest an alternate formula milk for my son, since I had to resume office after maternity break, he suggested to give aavin milk in a diluted form. When I tried this without knowing the underlying cause of my son's excessive possetting, he had severe bouts of vomiting and became drowsy...we rushed him to the doctor and he diagnosed and said my son has to admitted and given IV and if the vomiting doesn't subside he said a scan needs to be taken for further diagnosis. I was in an utter shock but by God's grace my son recovered automatically after the milk was digested. He put my son on another formula and when we tried that again the same scary vomiting episode. This time the doctor was very cool, asked me to give him domstal and try another formula. He would have prescribed almost all the formula milks available in the market to try one after another. Also my son had itchy rashes around his eyes which is a very typical symptom of CMPA (which I wasn't aware that time) and when I asked that doctor, without even examining he gave a very quick answer that it is a birth mark. The possetting episodes never stopped and I was not at peace and hence started researching and found all about this allergy and was again researching on a good doctor who would treat this kind of infant problems. and that's When I found Dr. Dhanasekar and he has to be thanked a million times. When we first time walked into the clinic he doctor at the very look of my son said he is suffering from CMPA and he put me on an elimination diet ie a diet free from milk and milk products first and observed a few days and eliminated some more stuff which could be causing the allergies and thereafter my son's possetting and eczema (rashes around his eyes) started curing off. A big thanks to Dr. Dhanasekar for his services. He is a boon to the medical industry. He spends ample time for each patient and he is a passionate pediatrician. A doctor who matches international standards. A great doctor really.",

We all have that feeling/experience/impression when we meet and interact with someone for the first time, and I believe that it's more than enough to testimony for them and the impression which doctor left is remarkable.

Usually, most of the experienced/popuar doctors spend hardly 5 minutes with the patient and don\u2019t spend quality time. But Mr. Dhanasekhar Kesavelu is an exception in this. Even if the patient is silent, he probes and makes the patient ask doubt and get it clarified. \nSure to continue consulting him for my daughters. Will definitely refer him to others. \n- Hussain. ",

The most difficult part for any doctor is to build a rapport and get the patient /parent to build confidence on himself/herself and understand their/their childs illness better and abide by the doctors treatment and recommendations. Any ethically practising doctor like me will not be want to called as \"commercialised or business oriented\" and in public forums one has to mind the language before placing any allegations like this. If you had read the board,I have clearly said that 'I practice paediatrics passionately and the child comes first and always\" and I have also said to speak in front rather than speaking on the back. Its sad that you are unaware that there are a lot of people who come to meet the doctor ( NOT ONLY PATIENTS!) hence there are uninvited people whom i have to attend to like bankers,sales people and etc etc who are also humans and I have to greet them to with a smile! long Waiting times is not unusual for any busy doctor and I have clearly said that emergencies will be attended to ASAP. I hope you find one of my colleagues who will be able to attend to your needs and see you ASAP and who sticks on to their values.\n\nI will be very happy to discuss this in my clinic with a prior appointment and we can sort things out in a more easier way.",

She continuosly suffers from nasal block and cold. And doctor keeps changing medicines which is in vain. Also he keeps a board with rules that says, how he gives inportance to child care and accepta walk in. But he never follows a single rule out of them. He would like to call his friends and bankers( yes, he called in bankers during patients time and that too with babies crying all over)....

Readily their to reply to the queries over messages and also to direct me for every little thing. I can't thank him enough for this and his treatment has worked miraculously for both be it for any small infection to major ones. He has the patience I haven't seen in any Doctor, let that be to explain anything to us or make the kids super friendly to him. My kids would recover just by visiting him or hearing from him. That's his magic! Sir thank you so much for rendering such lovely service to people. Ever grateful to you \ud83d\ude4f",
