Findings was mild antral gastritis. As per his prescription all the medicine taken at right time. Still now no improvement. I have booked for digital consultation of doctor Viswanathan on 06/10/2023  around 5.30 to 5.45pm but before the day of scheduled appointment, appointment rescheduled on 10/10/2023 around 5.0 to 5.15pm. Today I am waiting since 4.45 pm to 8.05pm but no video/audio call received from doctor. Even no rescheduled date. Such kind of behavior from such a reputed hospital is Unexpected. Now I have cancelled the appointment. Don't visit him. ** ** *** * ********** ",
