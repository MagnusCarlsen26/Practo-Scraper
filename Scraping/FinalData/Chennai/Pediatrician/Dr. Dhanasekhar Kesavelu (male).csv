"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","stomach and intestinal infections,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Dr. Dhanasekhar Kesavelu is incredible. Not only has he taken great care of my daughter health, but also he is lovely to speak with at every appointment.

Well it would take sometime for me to put together my experience with Dr.Dhanasekhar kesavelu, My daughter now 3.5 yesr old, fom born to one year she was very good in allaspects, suddnly started tool passing isuue, not going to motion properly, she have hard, infrequent bowel movements that are often difficult or painful to pass. We visited local doctors they given some mdicines but the problem was same, I took my daughter nearest city to my town There Doctros done scanning, x-ray and they suggested some medicines and told if it is not clear may be need to go for surgery and they suspected  “Hirschsprung's disease”.
I was utter shockedgot about my daughter and sesrched in web for good and experienced doctors I found Dr.Dhanasekhar Sir. I took my daughter to Dhanasekahr Sir, in the first visit it self by seeing my baby he told baby suffering from functional constipation, nothng to worry, My mind relaxed once after hering doctor words, No need surgery.

My daughter was treated 2 days back(we waited for 1 hr), once I receive the test results I eagerly went to show the reports to the doctor to get further treatment and the watchman manhandled me not allowed me inside to show the reports, I don’t understand what this process in here, do they expect patients to wait even more time to show reports? .

I live in Arakkomam which is about 2 hours from Chennai and visiting and waiting very often with kids is a task, but he has made this so so so simple for me. Readily their to reply to the queries over messages and also to direct me for every little thing. I can't thank him enough for this and his treatment has worked miraculously for both be it for any small infection to major ones. He has the patience I haven't seen in any Doctor, let that be to explain anything to us or make the kids super friendly to him. My kids would recover just by visiting him or hearing from him.
