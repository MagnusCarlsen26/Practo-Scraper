He is very polite and spends time to completely understand the patient's medical background and administers medicine accordingly. His dosages are not very high but mild *** ********** In 2 days, my son became normal and i would definitely recommend him to others. Morevoer, he himself called and enquired upon the health of the child after 3 days. It's good to see this kind of doctors.",

Dr.Sreedhar is so patient, spends time to listen to the complaints first, asks complete history of the child and thinks about various remedies , discussed with us and the best thing is his follow ups daily about the health condition of my son. He is not hasty in giving medicines and takes one step at a time. Going to visit him again this week and I have full confidence that my son will be allright soon with his guidance :) He is very helpful and we can call him for doubts in medicines and follow ups and he will answer our queries which is great for mothers like me who are worrying about child health !! I would surely and completely recommend him !! ",

He gave some medicines and asked us to call him twice a day to update him the progress. Not sure how many doctors do this without charging for phone consultation.

He is not hasty in giving medicines and takes one step at a time. Going to visit him again this week and I have full confidence that my son will be allright soon with his guidance :) He is very helpful and we can call him for doubts in medicines and follow ups and he will answer our queries which is great for mothers like me who are worrying about child health !! I would surely and completely recommend him !! ",

Though the blood sample did not show any signs of dengue. So, he suggested he can either give homeopathic or allopathic medicine. His preference was homeopathic on this instance. He gave some medicines and asked us to call him twice a day to update him the progress. Not sure how many doctors do this without charging for phone consultation. He followed it up till my daughter got well. We have to wait for long as he spends a lot of time with each patient. Though, it is for our betterment.",

I did not face the mind numbing experience of having to wait for 2-3 hours at the clinic for the doctor. I took my child, met the doctor and came back - as simple as that - which is what you want when you have a child crying of pain. You don't want to worry about packing a whole meal and 3 diapers for your waiting time at the doctor's clinic. I am so glad this is so close by to where we live. Such a boon!",

Eg this time I had to see an emergency  case which needed more time as he came with severe breathing difficulty . So obviously all the subsequent appointments got delayed. For this reason while booking appointment it is very clearly mentioned that there may be a waiting time  upto 60 min.Also during the pandemic we cannot allow patients to crowd in the waiting room. So best is to wait in an open area outside clinic and come in when called  ...I totally understand that its uncomfortable especially with kids but it goes a long way to prevent  transmission of corona ...Thank you for your feedback...",
