She diagnosed and did visual as well as x-ray inspection of my teeth and recommended few Cavity Fillings and Extraction of my Wisdom Teeth as well along with Deep Scaling and Cavity Fillings. I was on vacation from USA to my native place, Chennai, India and visited the Doctor Gayathri, as my brother recommended her based on her service for my brother's kids.  She was meticulous in diagnosing the issues and explaining the treatment plan and pros and cons of the treatment.  She is very friendly, calm and does the treatment with lot of patience in meticulous fashion. She has a Great Team with her staffs ( to name a few, Sasikala ), have been very friendly, supporting Dr. Gayathri with Treatments( Deep Cleaning, Cavity Filling etc ), followups, setting up appointments and explaining the treatment followup plan very well. \n\nOne thing, that I would like to highlight is I had stringent timeline and complete set of treatments viz Deep Scaling, Cavity Fillings, Root Canal,Extraction ( 2 Wisdom Teeth ) were all done within couple of week of time with modern Laser treatment technology and whole experience was a breeze considering the timeline and the way Dr. Gayathri and her Team executed the treatment plan. \n\nWith respect to ambiance, its very neat, tidy with state of art equipments and provides an excellent experience.  \n\nMany Thanks to Dr. Gayathri  and her Team. Keep up the Good Work.\n\nWarm Regards,\nGanesh. G.",

She diagnosed and did visual as well as x-ray inspection of my teeth and recommended few Cavity Fillings and Extraction of my Wisdom Teeth as well along with Deep Scaling and Cavity Fillings. I was on vacation from USA to my native place, Chennai, India and visited the Doctor Gayathri, as my brother recommended her based on her service for my brother's kids.  She was meticulous in diagnosing the issues and explaining the treatment plan and pros and cons of the treatment.  She is very friendly, calm and does the treatment with lot of patience in meticulous fashion. She has a Great Team with her staffs ( to name a few, Sasikala ), have been very friendly, supporting Dr. Gayathri with Treatments( Deep Cleaning, Cavity Filling etc ), followups, setting up appointments and explaining the treatment followup plan very well. \n\nOne thing, that I would like to highlight is I had stringent timeline and complete set of treatments viz Deep Scaling, Cavity Fillings, Root Canal,Extraction ( 2 Wisdom Teeth ) were all done within couple of week of time with modern Laser treatment technology and whole experience was a breeze considering the timeline and the way Dr. Gayathri and her Team executed the treatment plan. \n\nWith respect to ambiance, its very neat, tidy with state of art equipments and provides an excellent experience.  \n\nMany Thanks to Dr. Gayathri  and her Team. Keep up the Good Work.\n\nWarm Regards,\nGanesh. G.",

She was friendly indeed, that's very important to get the confidence.  The other dentists, support nurses demonstrated the same behaviour.

I had been told by other dentists that my root canal could not be done, but Dr. Gayathri was able to fix the issue with ease. From start to finish, the team was professional, friendly, and made me feel at ease. The facilities were clean and modern, and the staff were knowledgeable and attentive to my needs. I was impressed with their level of expertise, and the care and attention they gave me throughout the entire process. I would highly recommend Glow Dental Hospital to anyone in need of dental care, and especially to those who have been told that their dental issue is impossible to fix. Thank you to Dr. Gayathri and her team for their exceptional care and service.",

RCT was neatly done for my front teeth, also they followed up with us after every sitting. Tooth filling was also professionally done. Special mention to Dr. Nithya who is a skilled dentist and she patiently did tooth filling for me. Another thing I admired here is transparency, they will explain the process step by step while doing it. Also they will check multiple times if we are comfortable or not. Nurses and Doctors here are very polite without any attitude problems. Their work is also very neat. I would strongly recommend this place to my friends and family for any tooth ailments.",

I had been put in proper care by the Doctor over the period of 5 months and taken care of all the issues. Treatment is nothing short of excellent I have been provided with proper information and treatment plans upfront. Great effort was put out by the doctor to perform the treatment with at most care, and the treatment was almost painless. Follow-up on the treatment and assistance was really good. Really had a good experience with treatment and recovery,  Nothing short of great compared to when I was scared to start the treatment itself.\n\nA Special thanks to Dr. Nithya and Dr. Anu for taking the extra effort in the tooth filling treatment. Also for the attendant, for those who stood by helping to go through very few painful moments",

Due to my misaligned teeth, I did not have the confidence to give a proper smile anywhere. I didn't want to go for braces due to the time factor and the pain associated with it. At my first visit with Dr.Gayathri and Dr.Anulekha , I was able to convey my requirements effectively. They came up with a customized amazing solution which matched my needs.I just had to go for only 8 visits.That's it..... I'm new me with my super smile!!!\nGreat Thanks and appreciate the Entire Glow dental Medavakkam Team(Doctors,Dental Surgeon and all staffs) who were patient enough to hear me,explain and guide me through each and every step of the treatment. Painless Tooth extraction and Root canals were done. Especially would like to highlight their customer friendly appointments and frequent follow ups. I would like to share my smile transformation pictures as well.\nGlow with your smile @ Glow Dental !!!",

They are polite friendly and soft. \nComing back to my problem, I had to undergo reroute canal treatment as my root canal issue was not properly done few years back. \nDr Gayathri who handled my case is simply superb. She is experienced friendly, explains the problem and solution in allay man terms and patiently answers to all the questions asked. \nI would 100% recommend anyone who has dental problems, specially with root canal issue to get treated with Dr Gayathri. \nWorth the treatment.",

One specialty which I observed here is that doctors explain us what is the impact & what treatment will best suit you with graphical/immediate xrays. \n\nThe way they handle patients is just friendly. I would suggest this clinic to everyone. Just simply superb. Kudos to complete team there.. wish you all great future in the field.. \n\nOnce again thanks.... ",

But Dr. Gayathri and her team (Dr. Anulekha, Dr. Kowsalya and others) are doing a great job and I'm feeling far better now than before.  My issues may take some more time and I'm gradually  getting rid of my phobia.  They are very patient, know their job very well and make us feel secure.  Many thanks to Dr. Gayathri & team and I would recommend the clinic to anyone who has any dental issue. ",

But if good treatment is your primary requirement, I would highly recommend.  I went for cavity treatment on 1 teeth and for general polishing & cleaning. But my issues in other tooth were also explained and choice was left to me.\nI went ahead and treatment was excellent.\nStaffs are super friendly; Clinic is maintained very well; Regular post visit follow ups are done with patients - a big plus with this dental clinic. \nOverall, a great clinic to get yourself treated with your dental problems. I wish them a great success in their services.",

Dr. Gayathri is a true professional in her field, with a wealth of knowledge and experience that sets her apart. Her dedication to her patients is unparalleled.\n\nThe dentistry is equipped with the latest technologies  and they are always up-to-date with the latest techniques. After the procedure, Dr. Gayathri provided me with clear instructions on how to take care of myself, and they also called me to check on me the next day.\n\nI couldn't be happier with the results. The fillings and the root canal look great and I have no pain or discomfort. I would highly recommend Dr. Gayathri to anyone in need of a dentist. **** ***** *** *** **** ** *** ****** ",

When I met with one  Doctor in Chennai,  I came to know that it got infected and it needs to be removed and one teeth needs a RCT.  Which  would cost a lot of money, despite that \"he can't sure that he could save my tooth\" .  I was standing in front of the clinic and suddenly  many questions flashed through my mind  what!why!  how this happened with me!  That's moment I was looking for some best Doctor who can explain the root cause behind this and assure that he/she  can save my another teeth. Then,  I came across Glow Dental clinics. Here Dr. took X-rey of my teeth and explained all the treatment process and fixed the appointment with Dr. Gayatri for Root canal treatment  . It was very smooth process and was very much happy with the Dr Gayathri'd  treatment, explanation about the root cause of the problem  and overall staff behaviour. It was very friendly and supportive.  Where Dr. and team do the utmost  care of their patients. ",

She then suggested to consult with orthodontist Dr. Younis. \n\nDr. Younis : He has great expertise in the orthondontic treatment at this young age. He explained the treatment procedure, time frame in accurate manner and given me confident to proceed for the treatment. Every time i visit, he was quick and assess the improvements and respond & address the problem that i faced. Initially, i was not sure about the treatment, but later after 6 months the improvements were started as he explained in the beginning. Then after 1 year was 80%, then later 1.5 year, the treatments given me good amount of satisfaction. \n\nOverall, the approach, cost and treatment was great and my heartfelt thanks to Dr. Younis, Dr. Gayathri and the entire operation team in Glow dental.\n",

It was obvious to me that all the staff right from the janitor lady have been trained well to be courteous and polite. All necessary protection procedures for Covid-19 were promptly followed including a dispensable foot cover which is quite a welcome move!\nWithin a few minutes, I was ushered into a consultation room and Dr. Uthra did a fine job of understanding  my requirement and fixed up for the procedure the very next day. \nThe treatment itself was expertly carried out by Dr.Gayathri who was highly skilled, very patient, and painstakingly perfect.

The clinic is clean and hygienic and the doctors there are very friendly and knowledgeable. I had first visited the clinic a few months ago when one of my teeth had broken. Dr Gayathri did an excellent job on the tooth and it looks good as new, exactly like a real tooth. At the same time I also did two re- root canals on teeth that were causing me issues. The old root canals had completely broken down and had to be redone. Both these re root canals where complicated, but Dr Gayathri was able to save both the teeth and prevent them from being extracted. I am extremely satisfied with my experience with Glow Dental, Navallur.",
