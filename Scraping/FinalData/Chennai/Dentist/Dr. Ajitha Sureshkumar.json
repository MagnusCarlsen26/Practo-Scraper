As a parent I was nervous and skeptical about how the evening appointment will turn into. Dr. Ajitha was calm and clearly explained what has happened and was talking baby steps in introducing the dentist chair to my son. She was talking to my son and explaining next steps and taking it slow so that he won't be scared in future visits. We had to do three visits and my son didn't complain of any pain after the filling and did not resist to visit the clinic, that is a huge relief to me as a parent. The clinic is tidy with waiting area and staff are taking your appointment prior through phone call. Highly recommended.",

As a parent I was nervous and skeptical about how the evening appointment will turn into. Dr. Ajitha was calm and clearly explained what has happened and was talking baby steps in introducing the dentist chair to my son. She was talking to my son and explaining next steps and taking it slow so that he won't be scared in future visits. We had to do three visits and my son didn't complain of any pain after the filling and did not resist to visit the clinic, that is a huge relief to me as a parent. The clinic is tidy with waiting area and staff are taking your appointment prior through phone call. Highly recommended.",
