"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Paedodontics,",0,0,YES,"Dr.Vijayaprabha is such a caring and amazing dentist. She is extremely friendly and patient. She takes utmost care of her patients. I had visited the clinic for the first time when my son was 1 year old for his tooth decay treatment. She knows how to talk and handle the children in a way that builds trust and make the child feel ease & comfortable. Even after shifting my home far from the clinic location, I have been visiting the doctor for all dental problems of my family members. Its been 7 years I have been visiting the doctor as we didn't feel comfortable and confident with other corporate dental clinics.

She clearly understands the root of the problem and starts the treatment swiftly.  The clinic is very well maintained and neat. I can't thank enough for her support, care, kindness & patience through my experience.  Visiting doctors are also very much patient friendly. In my experience, she never asked for unnecessary visits/treatments. She manages the appointments very well and never made us for more than 10-15 mins. Above all, she used to give multiple wellness tips to maintain oral hygiene & to avoid tooth decay. Its really difficult to find a doctor nowadays who gives tips to avoid/minimize the visits. She is genuine & the most incredible dentist I have ever seen.
