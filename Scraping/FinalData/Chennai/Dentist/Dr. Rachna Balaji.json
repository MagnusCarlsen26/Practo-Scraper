On the first day, she scanned the particular tooth I was facing issues with, took an X-ray and proceeded with cleaning the tooth. She asked me to come for RCT the next day. Before starting with the treatment, she told it usually takes 20 to 30 mins for RCT and it is not painful. Believe me, she took more than 2 hours and I had to ask her to stop with the procedure since I was not able to bear the sensitivity. I explained her my issue n number of times to which she angrily replied - if you do not cooperate, I will not be able to continue with the treatment and will call someone else... and continued drilling. After a while I desperately asked her to stop and her response to my request was -  had it been a public clinic nobody would have listened but since it is a private clinic I am accepting your request because for us your comfort is a priority. She called someone up and explained what I was going through. That someone advised her to use Articaine ****** *** *** *** ***** *** told her that I might be a case of hot tooth or hot pulp. She gave an open cotton dressing and asked me to come the next day. I obviously did not dare to go. Later in the evening I reached out to my regular dentist in Mumbai and explained him the situation. ** *** **** * ********** **** * ****** ** *** ** *********** *** ********* ******* ** *** ********* *** ** ********** *** **** ******* ****  ** ***** ******* * * ***** **** ***** ** ** ******* *** *** ******* ** **** ****** * ** *** **** ***** ***** **** *** * **** ** ****** ****** ****** ** ****** ***** * ********** *** ********** *** *** *** *** ********* ********* *** **** **** ******** ** *** *** ** ** ***** *** * ******** * *** *** ****** **** *** **** ** *** ********* *********** *** ******* ** ***** *** ** **** * ***** *** *** ** ****** *** *** ********* ** ** ***** **** *** ****** **** ******* ***** *** ********* ** **** ** **** * **** ** ***** ** ******* *** ******** * ** ** *****\n\nNow all is good and I am never going back to Dr.Rachna. I was simply charged 4k for  the X-ray, Scan( which were not given to me), cleaning, and a small filling. \n\nI would not recommend her at all. ** *** ****** ****** ** * ****",

I was comfortable speaking in Hindi, fortunately Rachana speaks lovely Hindi and she comforted me very well. She diagnosed me to have grinding of teeth habit, for which she gave me soft splints, no one in the past have assessed me for this. One week now I am greatly relieved of my pain. Doctor is so calm and educates about hygiene so well. I feel she has taken dentistry to the next level. Before visiting her I have to number of dentist, no one has the acumen as Dr. Rachana. God bless her for her services.",

On the first day, she scanned the particular tooth I was facing issues with, took an X-ray and proceeded with cleaning the tooth. She asked me to come for RCT the next day. Before starting with the treatment, she told it usually takes 20 to 30 mins for RCT and it is not painful. Believe me, she took more than 2 hours and I had to ask her to stop with the procedure since I was not able to bear the sensitivity. I explained her my issue n number of times to which she angrily replied - if you do not cooperate, I will not be able to continue with the treatment and will call someone else... and continued drilling. After a while I desperately asked her to stop and her response to my request was -  had it been a public clinic nobody would have listened but since it is a private clinic I am accepting your request because for us your comfort is a priority. She called someone up and explained what I was going through. That someone advised her to use Articaine ****** *** *** *** ***** *** told her that I might be a case of hot tooth or hot pulp. She gave an open cotton dressing and asked me to come the next day. I obviously did not dare to go.

I was comfortable speaking in Hindi, fortunately Rachana speaks lovely Hindi and she comforted me very well. She diagnosed me to have grinding of teeth habit, for which she gave me soft splints, no one in the past have assessed me for this. One week now I am greatly relieved of my pain. Doctor is so calm and educates about hygiene so well. I feel she has taken dentistry to the next level. Before visiting her I have to number of dentist, no one has the acumen as Dr. Rachana. God bless her for her services.",
