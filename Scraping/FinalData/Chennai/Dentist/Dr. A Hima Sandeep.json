I have great experience with this clinic as I had my wisdom tooth extraction where I didn't feel inch of pain.I was so normal after my extraction. It was a splendid job and they care like anything. Post my extraction they were very caring and helped me to provide ice packs, necessary pain killer, and juices etc... Their surgeon is also very talented who has done my extraction very quickly with care. I totally give them very good rating and I recommend this doctor to all my relatives and friends for sure. Much appreciated. ",
