2. The consultation charges is 250 which I feel very less in Chennai living

3. All the tooth fillings will look tiny only (for you) but the material is same for us. The filling material was the light cure Ivoclar composite. I never compromise on my work. The following work was done,
          A. First the cavity was prepared for which I have to use all my autoclaved instruments where we doctors won't get the electricity for free to autoclave
          B. The tooth was isolated using rubber dam to avoid any salivary contamination for the life of the filling. 
          C. The 3M acid etchant was used
          D. The ivoclare bonding agent used
          E. The ivoclare high strength posterior composite was filled n polished

Note, all the materials come with GST for doctors n we don't claim this from our patients. The materials used were gold standard.

4. Yes you were asked to come to other clinic because there was a power shut down, feel happy that you were severed without ignoring.

5. I agree that you were made to wait for an hour because I was looking into other patient, just because you are waiting I can't leave his treatment half done.

6. The X Ray was taken to diagnose the problem ie whether the dental caries is deep involving the pulp of the tooth. I don't think doctors have X-ray in their eyes.

Your tooth stains were hard to remove n it was covered all over the tooth surface especially front tooth, when we attend to do in front tooth the water flashes outside the oral cavity.
The sensitivity should settle in a couple of days.
The scaling usually takes 15 minutes but for you it took approximately 40 minutes.
