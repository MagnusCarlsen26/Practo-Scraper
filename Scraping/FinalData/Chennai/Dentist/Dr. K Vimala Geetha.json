The assurance and the explanations that she gives before the procedure is extra ordinary. It's in very simple terms for anyone to understand and she lists out the pros and cons and lets us take a call. She is very straight forward and an unconventional doctor who makes you feel at ease being it just a consultation or a procedure. I still remember the day i took my kids for their appointment and I landed up at the clinics doorsteps worrying about not giving the kids a traumatic dental experience. Doctor Vimala handled the kids with so much of patience and made it a fun memory for them indeed inspite of teeth extractions and the kids were so comfortable which in fact gave me the confidence and trust to  reach out to her when it was my turn. And my trust was not misplaced. She is just brilliant and a master of her trade and I highly recommend her.",

The assurance and the explanations that she gives before the procedure is extra ordinary. It's in very simple terms for anyone to understand and she lists out the pros and cons and lets us take a call. She is very straight forward and an unconventional doctor who makes you feel at ease being it just a consultation or a procedure. I still remember the day i took my kids for their appointment and I landed up at the clinics doorsteps worrying about not giving the kids a traumatic dental experience. Doctor Vimala handled the kids with so much of patience and made it a fun memory for them indeed inspite of teeth extractions and the kids were so comfortable which in fact gave me the confidence and trust to  reach out to her when it was my turn. And my trust was not misplaced. She is just brilliant and a master of her trade and I highly recommend her.",
