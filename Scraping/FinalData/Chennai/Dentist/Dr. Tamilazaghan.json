The war time is less, the rct was done is 20 mins flawlessly with ease n there was no pain or any post treatment or swelling. The wait time fr crown was also 1.5 days. Issues with my 3 teeth got treated within a week. The pricing is reasonable and clinic is well equipped with all necessary devices n all devices are also sterilised after every patient leaves. I highly recommend this clinic",

Together they rectified all the post rct issues I had as a result of getting treatment from various other dentists who were given 5 star ratings in this site. The war time is less, the rct was done is 20 mins flawlessly with ease n there was no pain or any post treatment or swelling. The wait time fr crown was also 1.5 days. Issues with my 3 teeth got treated within a week. The pricing is reasonable and clinic is well equipped with all necessary devices n all devices are also sterilised after every patient leaves. I highly recommend this clinic",
