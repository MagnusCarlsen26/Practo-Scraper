Dr. Rajesh and his team were extremely friendly and made me super comfortable during the procedure. I did not experience any discomfort during the procedure. He patiently cleared all my queries.\n\nThe ambience is very hygienic. Follow-ups post-procedure made me more confident on the path to recovery. Furthermore, my mother underwent a tooth extraction procedure, and she is doing well now. Thank you so much, Dr.Rajesh.\nOverall, great and exceptional service.\n\nI would highly recommend Thangam's dental clinic!",

Eager to get it set right, concerned at the same time  of what will this involve, cost and time involved. Having a 2+ month baby at home, these concerns were prominent. Went with my Spouse. We found the following as huge Plus Points:                               \n 1) wait time: was Zero. We were attended on the time of Appointment.\n2) Friendliness: Doctor has a way of engaging. Enquires about the  family,  small talk, listens with attention.  All these facilitate the Patient to relax and get ready for the process  that will be next.  \n3)  Explanation of the issues: Doctor explained the material used for capping will have to change. Made a fix with a resin that will hold on for few months to come. \n4) Value gained:  I do not know what the Doctor gained.... but grateful the way he understands the concerns unspoken and billed in a way that the temporary setting will pull through the period. The cost was very minimal. Also, shared the aspects, that need to be attended as soon as possible.  Our Best Wishes to Doctor and his Family... \nKudos to Thangam Clinic!",

Dr. Rajesh and his team were extremely friendly and made me super comfortable during the procedure. I did not experience any discomfort during the procedure. He patiently cleared all my queries.\n\nThe ambience is very hygienic. Follow-ups post-procedure made me more confident on the path to recovery. Furthermore, my mother underwent a tooth extraction procedure, and she is doing well now. Thank you so much, Dr.Rajesh.\nOverall, great and exceptional service.\n\nI would highly recommend Thangam's dental clinic!",

Eager to get it set right, concerned at the same time  of what will this involve, cost and time involved. Having a 2+ month baby at home, these concerns were prominent. Went with my Spouse. We found the following as huge Plus Points:                               \n 1) wait time: was Zero. We were attended on the time of Appointment.\n2) Friendliness: Doctor has a way of engaging. Enquires about the  family,  small talk, listens with attention.  All these facilitate the Patient to relax and get ready for the process  that will be next.  \n3)  Explanation of the issues: Doctor explained the material used for capping will have to change. Made a fix with a resin that will hold on for few months to come. \n4) Value gained:  I do not know what the Doctor gained.... but grateful the way he understands the concerns unspoken and billed in a way that the temporary setting will pull through the period. The cost was very minimal. Also, shared the aspects, that need to be attended as soon as possible.  Our Best Wishes to Doctor and his Family... \nKudos to Thangam Clinic!",

As per appointment I was attended.No waste of time.The doctor takes the complete medical history and medication meticulously,before going into the diagnosis. Doctor gives a patient hearing .His advises before and after the procedure very good.During the procedure he treats the patient with extra care to make the patient feel at home.  In my case I did not feel any pain during the procedure.The follow up by the doctor after treatment is commendable.He has a good set of assistants. Even though I  am far from the clinic ,despite being old I still like to visit Thangam clinic  for any tooth problem.you go with pain and return with no pain. I have no hesitation in recommending Dr. Rajesh Kumaar.      for any dental problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nGod's Blessings  to everyone.\r\n\r\nInline image 1",
