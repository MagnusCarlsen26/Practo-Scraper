After searching for a dentist, it appeared that Dr. Soundaram's office was a viable option.  Her positive reviews, plus the close proximity to our hotel made for a good fit . Also, after calling several other dentists in the area, she was the first to respond; so we made appointments.  Perhaps, because she has a home based clinic in a residential part of town, the auto-rickshaw driver had a bit of a problem finding her.   It turns out, her office is within walking distance to Green Park Hotel.   Dr. Soundaram's warmth and professionalism are gifts.  She clearly explains what needs to be done, the options available and the best outcomes. She was honest enough to say,  I didn't need anything done.  However, my husband needed two root canals.  In one day, Dr. Soundaram performed the entire work.  In two days the crowns came in and she put them in place.  My husband had NO PAIN at all!!!   In the USA, this procedure would have cost hundreds, perhaps thousands of dollars US.  Dr. Soundaram didn't gouge us.  She charged Indian ruppee cost.  There was no wait time at all.  I can't say enough about her expertise and and friendliness.  Any time we need work done, we will make appointments with her!   My only wish is that her beautiful window box where I sat for hours while she worked on my husband, had a cushion on the gorgeous, but very  hard granite!  LOL",

After searching for a dentist, it appeared that Dr. Soundaram's office was a viable option.  Her positive reviews, plus the close proximity to our hotel made for a good fit . Also, after calling several other dentists in the area, she was the first to respond; so we made appointments.  Perhaps, because she has a home based clinic in a residential part of town, the auto-rickshaw driver had a bit of a problem finding her.   It turns out, her office is within walking distance to Green Park Hotel.   Dr. Soundaram's warmth and professionalism are gifts.  She clearly explains what needs to be done, the options available and the best outcomes. She was honest enough to say,  I didn't need anything done.  However, my husband needed two root canals.  In one day, Dr. Soundaram performed the entire work.  In two days the crowns came in and she put them in place.  My husband had NO PAIN at all!!!   In the USA, this procedure would have cost hundreds, perhaps thousands of dollars US.  Dr. Soundaram didn't gouge us.  She charged Indian ruppee cost.  There was no wait time at all.  I can't say enough about her expertise and and friendliness.  Any time we need work done, we will make appointments with her!   My only wish is that her beautiful window box where I sat for hours while she worked on my husband, had a cushion on the gorgeous, but very  hard granite!  LOL",

I went to the doctor for my wisdom tooth extraction and was very scared doctor made me feel very comfortable and it was painless. She was also following up every day after the treatment to check on my condition, she also made sure that all safety precautions were taken care of during this pandemic season, and it is very affordable also. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a dentist appointment \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
