I also had my tooth extracted, it was complicated as the roots were joint in centre and involved bone cutting. This too was done by a maxillofacial surgeon, painless and in about 15 minutes. The clinic is the best I have visited, services are reasonably priced, all equipments were disinfected before use. I am very happy. ",

He helped me out in stopping my habit and he cleaned my teeth taking so much time. He suggested me some medicines and I use to have severe headach, ear pain and all. He gave me a soft splint to wear it during night and I can see magic in it. In few days even that pain is reduced and I am very much satisfied now. Painfree and able to eat well also. Treatment wise everything is very perfect. Highly recommended",

I thank Dr.Imran and also thank Dr. Pavithra ( Assistant Doctor ) for extending their full expertise in taking care of my dental issues. They have been very friendly and patient to guide me correctly and also clear all my doubts whenever I sought for explanations. Earlier I had lot of infections and had problem in proper eating. However after the treatment I am back to normal. I am very happy that my dental issues were taken care of very well.\n\nI will be very pleased to recommend the services of Dr.Imran and his team to anyone facing dental issues. \n",

I also had my tooth extracted, it was complicated as the roots were joint in centre and involved bone cutting. This too was done by a maxillofacial surgeon, painless and in about 15 minutes. The clinic is the best I have visited, services are reasonably priced, all equipments were disinfected before use. I am very happy. ",

He helped me out in stopping my habit and he cleaned my teeth taking so much time. He suggested me some medicines and I use to have severe headach, ear pain and all. He gave me a soft splint to wear it during night and I can see magic in it. In few days even that pain is reduced and I am very much satisfied now. Painfree and able to eat well also.

It looks very clean and well maintained starting from front desk to the treatment rooms.And I should appreciate the working staff and the doctors they hospitality is so good and they make u feel so comfortable. I usually use to be scared to go to a doctor or any clinic but here it's completely different Dr.Imran sir and Dr.Tanzila both are cool. They talk to you as a friend and they approach is very fabulous. They use all advance technology and quality treatment. I would like to give 5star  overall.I met with an accident  I was having few broken front teeth and one tooth was fully broken and doctor advised to be removed. After removing they waited for few days until then I was given a temporary crown which looked like original teeth. Later I was called for the final measure and after 3 days my permanent crowns were fixed. After fixing I was very happy seeing it. It looks same like how it use to be before and no one can identify it's artificial. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffbto the  team",

I was very afraid and I came to Tanzi Dental Dr. Imran he checked everything and said about my joint problem, first he started with basic cleaning procedure and gave me a clip type soft guard and right now I can feel much difference in my pain. And later he suggested wisdom tooth removal. I'm done with wisdom teeth removal also. They all are experienced doctors and I feel better after my removal also no pain during the procedure. After ten days they have called for a checkup also, hopefully I got a confidence through them definitely I will recover from this problem. Thank you Dr. Imran for giving me such a positive results .",
