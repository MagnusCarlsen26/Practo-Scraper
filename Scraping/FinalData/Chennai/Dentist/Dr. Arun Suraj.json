I was in Chennai only for a few days and he expedited his treatment upon my request and made it very flexible. The end result was fantabulous and I was 100% satisfied with Arun\u2019s smile design solutions. I had never in my life smiled with so much confidence, thanks to Arun I don\u2019t have to be self conscious while smiling any more ! It\u2019s been a month since I got my smile design procedure done and I haven\u2019t felt any discomfort or problems with my teeth caps. The clinic itself is well maintained with positive vibes. The staffs and support doctors are very friendly and flexible with patient\u2019s needs. The only thing that I felt could be improved is the timing.  My appointments were always delayed by 15-30 mins. It\u2019s understandable for a clinic and I didn\u2019t have an issue since I was on a holiday but might be frustrating for office goers. Oh and I never felt a teeny tiny bit of pain during the entire procedure ( I had to take 8 injections in my gums at one point Ha Ha !)",
