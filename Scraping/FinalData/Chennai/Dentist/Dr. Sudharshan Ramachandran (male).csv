"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"Sure! Here's a review for a doctor dentist:

---

I recently had the pleasure of visiting Dr. Sudershan Ramachandran for a routine check-up 

 and I couldn't be more impressed with the level of care and professionalism I received. From the moment I walked into the office, I was greeted by a friendly and attentive staff who made me feel welcome and comfortable.

Dr. Sudershan R is exceptionally skilled and *************, taking the time to explain each step of the process and answer all of my questions. Their gentle approach and attention to detail made the entire experience painless and stress-free. I particularly appreciated the modern equipment and techniques used, which ensured a thorough and efficient treatment.

The office itself is clean, well-organized, and equipped with the latest technology, which further enhanced my confidence in the quality of care provided. Dr. Sudershan genuine concern for their patients' well-being is evident, and I left feeling more informed about my dental health and confident in the care I received.

I highly recommend Dr. Sudershan to anyone in need of dental services. Their expertise, compassionate approach, and commitment to patient satisfaction make them an outstanding choice for dental care.",2024-07-03 17:24:08,False,True,T UDAYARAJ,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Implant,",0,0,YES,I went to Dr Sudarshan to get 4 dental implants on the upper and lower jaw on the right hand side. I already had 3 or 4 implants from another doctor who had done a good job. I decided to switch my doctor to Sudarshan because i had gone to him for other things and liked him. I have to say that Dr Sudarshan did an excellent job in many ways. 1. I communicated that pain management was very important to me. He was very good in handling this made sure that in a surgery like putting in implants he paid enough attention that the pain factor during surgery was minimal (remember they drill into the jawbone when this is done) 2. Great post op instructions and response on whatsapp for any doubts 3. Because of the instructions given i was able to manage post op pain and had very little swelling despite an intense procedure and had stiches removed within 4 working days 4. My previous dentist while being good was twice as expensive as Dr Sudarshan for a procedure like implants. Very happy overall.
