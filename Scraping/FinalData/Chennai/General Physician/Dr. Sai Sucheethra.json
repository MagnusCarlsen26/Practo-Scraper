Actually, she is the one who discovered my son has ADHD/ASD at the age of 2 during a casual visit. It was a complete shock to us. But she stayed a strong support and immediately suggested few home programs to start with and we did so. I believe she is the only person in Southern India (not sure about the rest of India) to come up with this integrated therapy classes (Occupational therapy + Sensory therapy + Speech therapy + Special Education). Because we are basically from Bangalore and we heard therapist there appreciating this kind of integrated classes, which is not there anywhere. The benefit of the integrated therapy classes is that each therapist can know how the kid is improving collectively across all areas. This helps them to set clear goals and work towards it. We took this integrated therapy classes for my son during the summer holidays for a month and we could see a drastic improvement in him. Since then based on her advice we are continuing with different therapist in Bangalore, but still we come to Chennai to check the progress of my son and guidance from her. Now my son is about 4 yrs old and he has shown tremendous improvement in terms of speech, behaviour, and studies. We can completely vouch for Dr Sai Sucheetra and for her treatment. Because we know how sincere she is to this job and her love/care for kids. ",
