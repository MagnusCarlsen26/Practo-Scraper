,,0,0,YES,"Hi, He is really a good & patient friendly doctor.  But I do have a small request to him, please stop using Mobile phones while discussing with patients. Recently more frequently I could see you having telephonic conversions and parralelly asking patients about their health. This makes patient uncomfortable. When we pay 500 to 1000 bucks for consultation,  we would expect the proper attention being  paid for that 15 to 20 minutes. ",2021-05-08 03:59:16,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
