And I like 2 things about her.1.She attends phone call of patients. in case if she is busy, she will call back as soon as possible. Now adays no doctos talk on the phone with patients. Their assistant only attend and book the appointment. But she is very different from other doctors in my opinion. one day I told Dr. Jayasree that, mam you are really awesome because when ever I call you or msg. you respond me immediately mam thank you so much I said. *** ******* ***** **** * ******* **** **** ******** ***** * ***** ***** ******** ****** **** ********** ***** ********* ** ********** **** **** ******* ****** *********** ******** ******* ** * ****** **** *********** ** *** *****2. Her Punctuality. she will not make patients wait longer in the clinic. when I call her, she will tell the time. when I can meet her in the clinic so time saving and tension free.  And one day I talked with other patients when I was waiting in the clinic .they shared their personal experience i.e ( after 8 years married life a woman got pregnant after taking treatment here) like wise 3 years, 6 years. they all gave positive feedback only.  according to their feedback I think she is a (kairasiyana) doctor for infertility and women health issues. I am also satisfied with the treatment. I would recommend her to other patients. Thank you so much mam. and sorry ( I am not very good at english  I have written in between the sentences in Tamil (tanglish) \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c",

Firstly, she has a warm personality and a pleasant demeanor. She is a really good listener and she has always been very receptive to every concern and worry any of us had and took her time to explain and ressure us. She is constantly thorough in her examination. She usually takes ample time to explain a condition, makes sure we've understood well before she moves onto treatment options. She never fails to lay out all of the options available, highlight the pros and cons for each one before she gives her opinion on the best suited option for our family member who is the patient, and she also encourages to think it over well before making a decision. She keeps up with the latest proven forms of treatment options. It's worth mentioning that she was the first and only Doctor to suggest a less invasive option and an alternative to surgery when my mother was diagnosed with Adenomyosis and was initially advised to have a hysterectomy. The suggested option involved Emily, an intrauterine device that periodically released hormones to help control excessive endometrial growth which resulted in heavy bleeding. It worked well for my mother. She has helped me put behind a case of persistent UTAs which kept coming back for no discernable reason. Every appointment with her ends with ample and practical advice from her for overall health and lifestyle.",

Physically I had a lot to undergo like irregular periods and mental stress. So I decided to go for a doctor's consultation and at the first meeting the doctor gave me confidence and medicines and gave some morale boosting advice which helped me recover from my first trauma.\n        Her medication and treatment made me better and I was able to get back normal.\n        No other doctor could be as friendly as she was. Jayashree madam easily understood my health and mental status as well.\n        Her fees are according to market and there is no overcharging. I can call or message her at anytime and she is there for me. When she's free at clinic she laughs and enjoys with her patients. she attends phone call of patients,in case mam is busy,she will call back asap. Nowadays no doctors talk on the phone with patients.but she is kind and friendly. \n         Every time I meet mam, she keeps telling \u201cDon\u2019t worry ,just stay positive and keep your mind free, everything will be fine\u201d.Her postive thoughts and encouraging words made me feel strong.i am so blessed to find Dr. Jeyashree mam in this corner of earth. Whenever I get an appointment with doctor, I never waited too long for consultation. Also, Dr. Jeyashree mam takes time to talk to me, clear all our doubts no matter the no of patients waiting for consultation.\n         My husband and I decided to go for a baby and the doctor gave good planning and advice and also some medication.By god's grace I got pregnant again and  From then our journey started with the doctor more frequently.\n      I believe more than the medicines, it\u2019s the positive energy and the encouragement helped me keep away the fear about the miscarriage again.\n      Treatment wise Dr. Jeyashree mam has prescribed me what I actually need. The scan facility in the clinic is the added advantage. The Consultation fee and the Scan charges are very very reasonable compared to what other hospitals charge. She gave complete confidence and positivity to forget the initial trauma and I gained confidence and we visited the doctor every month. Everything went well with doctors advice . I followed everything well. Every checkp doctor gave diet charts personal advice and medication.Doctor fees is normal and affordable. She prescribed only limited medicine. \n       On 22feb I got labour pain and visited doctor she advised to get admitted in hospital. She gave me the confidence and\nShe treated me as her own child.With half an hour she came to Rainbow hospital and did a complete normal delivery for me.\n    All thanks to the jayashree mam kept on motivating me.i am really thankful to her for my successful and beautiful pregnancy journey.I m so much thankful and grateful for rest of my life. I recommend this doctor to everyone .\n       Thank you mam..I have a beautiful journey with you .Thanks a lot mam\ud83d\ude18",

She does not prescribe any unnecessary medications/supplements or tests/scans. One of the few doctors who does not make us panic unnecessarily by quoting medical terms and their values. She makes us feel confident about our body\u2019s ability to go through pregnancy and delivery. Doctor explains physical examinations clearly before conducting them . By the time the baby is ready to be born, doctor almost becomes a family member. Even when I was in active labour, she helped me remain calm and composed by coaching me through the process. We don\u2019t have to read any pregnancy or childbirth tutorials. We just need to follow the doctor\u2019s advice to have a fulfilling experience in child birth and an easy postpartum recovery. Trustworthy and highly recommended!",

And I like 2 things about her.1.She attends phone call of patients. in case if she is busy, she will call back as soon as possible. Now adays no doctos talk on the phone with patients. Their assistant only attend and book the appointment. But she is very different from other doctors in my opinion. one day I told Dr. Jayasree that, mam you are really awesome because when ever I call you or msg. you respond me immediately mam thank you so much I said. *** ******* ***** **** * ******* **** **** ******** ***** * ***** ***** ******** ****** **** ********** ***** ********* ** ********** **** **** ******* ****** *********** ******** ******* ** * ****** **** *********** ** *** *****2. Her Punctuality. she will not make patients wait longer in the clinic. when I call her, she will tell the time. when I can meet her in the clinic so time saving and tension free.  And one day I talked with other patients when I was waiting in the clinic .they shared their personal experience i.e ( after 8 years married life a woman got pregnant after taking treatment here) like wise 3 years, 6 years. they all gave positive feedback only.  according to their feedback I think she is a (kairasiyana) doctor for infertility and women health issues. I am also satisfied with the treatment. I would recommend her to other patients. Thank you so much mam. and sorry ( I am not very good at english  I have written in between the sentences in Tamil (tanglish) \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c",

Firstly, she has a warm personality and a pleasant demeanor. She is a really good listener and she has always been very receptive to every concern and worry any of us had and took her time to explain and ressure us. She is constantly thorough in her examination. She usually takes ample time to explain a condition, makes sure we've understood well before she moves onto treatment options. She never fails to lay out all of the options available, highlight the pros and cons for each one before she gives her opinion on the best suited option for our family member who is the patient, and she also encourages to think it over well before making a decision. She keeps up with the latest proven forms of treatment options. It's worth mentioning that she was the first and only Doctor to suggest a less invasive option and an alternative to surgery when my mother was diagnosed with Adenomyosis and was initially advised to have a hysterectomy. The suggested option involved Emily, an intrauterine device that periodically released hormones to help control excessive endometrial growth which resulted in heavy bleeding. It worked well for my mother. She has helped me put behind a case of persistent UTAs which kept coming back for no discernable reason. Every appointment with her ends with ample and practical advice from her for overall health and lifestyle.",

Physically I had a lot to undergo like irregular periods and mental stress. So I decided to go for a doctor's consultation and at the first meeting the doctor gave me confidence and medicines and gave some morale boosting advice which helped me recover from my first trauma.\n        Her medication and treatment made me better and I was able to get back normal.\n        No other doctor could be as friendly as she was. Jayashree madam easily understood my health and mental status as well.\n        Her fees are according to market and there is no overcharging. I can call or message her at anytime and she is there for me. When she's free at clinic she laughs and enjoys with her patients. she attends phone call of patients,in case mam is busy,she will call back asap. Nowadays no doctors talk on the phone with patients.but she is kind and friendly. \n         Every time I meet mam, she keeps telling \u201cDon\u2019t worry ,just stay positive and keep your mind free, everything will be fine\u201d.Her postive thoughts and encouraging words made me feel strong.i am so blessed to find Dr. Jeyashree mam in this corner of earth. Whenever I get an appointment with doctor, I never waited too long for consultation. Also, Dr. Jeyashree mam takes time to talk to me, clear all our doubts no matter the no of patients waiting for consultation.\n         My husband and I decided to go for a baby and the doctor gave good planning and advice and also some medication.By god's grace I got pregnant again and  From then our journey started with the doctor more frequently.\n      I believe more than the medicines, it\u2019s the positive energy and the encouragement helped me keep away the fear about the miscarriage again.\n      Treatment wise Dr. Jeyashree mam has prescribed me what I actually need. The scan facility in the clinic is the added advantage. The Consultation fee and the Scan charges are very very reasonable compared to what other hospitals charge. She gave complete confidence and positivity to forget the initial trauma and I gained confidence and we visited the doctor every month. Everything went well with doctors advice . I followed everything well. Every checkp doctor gave diet charts personal advice and medication.Doctor fees is normal and affordable. She prescribed only limited medicine. \n       On 22feb I got labour pain and visited doctor she advised to get admitted in hospital. She gave me the confidence and\nShe treated me as her own child.With half an hour she came to Rainbow hospital and did a complete normal delivery for me.\n    All thanks to the jayashree mam kept on motivating me.i am really thankful to her for my successful and beautiful pregnancy journey.I m so much thankful and grateful for rest of my life. I recommend this doctor to everyone .\n       Thank you mam..I have a beautiful journey with you .Thanks a lot mam\ud83d\ude18",

She does not prescribe any unnecessary medications/supplements or tests/scans. One of the few doctors who does not make us panic unnecessarily by quoting medical terms and their values. She makes us feel confident about our body\u2019s ability to go through pregnancy and delivery. Doctor explains physical examinations clearly before conducting them . By the time the baby is ready to be born, doctor almost becomes a family member. Even when I was in active labour, she helped me remain calm and composed by coaching me through the process. We don\u2019t have to read any pregnancy or childbirth tutorials. We just need to follow the doctor\u2019s advice to have a fulfilling experience in child birth and an easy postpartum recovery. Trustworthy and highly recommended!",
