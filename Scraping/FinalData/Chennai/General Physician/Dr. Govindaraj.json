One fine day while playing tannins I felt a twist and a extreme pain I can never explain and could not straighten my leg.\n \nMRI indicated my ACL in left knee was torn , after a couple of opinions a doctor friend of mine referred me to Dr. ABG ( as his nick name ), he advised I should go for ACL reconstruction. \nI took multiple opinions doctors indicate the same , but I was impressed with Dr. ABG's interpretation and he could understand what I need to get back to my routine sports activities. Like everyone I was initially nervous as I had a fear I could not do anything again post surgery, I trusted him and went through his advice.I also realised that Physio treatment can only do much and help only in minor injuries.\n\nI was very much impressed by his analysis of the issue and he promised me I can \"walk back home\"  made me stand on a brick with whole weight on my left leg, I was stunned, I could not do that even prior to my injury the other day, I have never seen this kind of confidence in my experience with Doctors given my fair share of accidents in sports.\n\nI truly appreciate the Dr. ABG and his surgical team for doing a fantastic job and his kind words are very warming during consultation. I recommend Dr. ABG for any orthopaedic related cases and he is one of a kind.\n\nI'm still in rehab now, given the amount of sports I play I can surely say my knee feels good and I see no issues to resume playing again.\n\nI also advice patients to have strong will power to get back to normal which is something which comes from within and no medics can give treatment to that.\n\n-abhilash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Though he had to leave Office for other commitments, stayed back to see my X-rays to suggest treatment.\n\nVery patient, friendly, humble for his stature and answered all my queries without any irritation as I was eating into his time.\n\nNo tests were ordered and he advised me not to go for scans unnecessarily and told me to meet him after 3 months. Only exercises were  advised which he himself taught me and waited patiently till I got them right.\n\nHe is so approachable and makes u feel at ease throughout the consultation. \n\nWas happy I met not only a good Doctor but a very good human being also.",
