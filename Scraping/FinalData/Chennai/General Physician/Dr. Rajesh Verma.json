While we were very eager to start a family, I could not get pregnant as easily as I thought. Myself and my husband were living abroad and were quite hesitant to start with any fertility treatment hastily without any proper guidance. \nHence, I came down to India in 2018 for a health checkup at a renowned hospital in Chetpet, Chennai. After a master checkup, the chief doctor there performed Hysterolaproscopy for a left  tubal disconnection. Also, later I was told that I could get pregnant only through IVF. With no other option left and without asking any 2nd opinion, I underwent all the procedures for IVF. Finally at the end of the IVF procedure, after embryo transplant , it was sad to know that I did not conceive. It was so harrowing to experience that feel, because emotionally and financially it was quite a loss for us. Though the IVF doctor asked me to go for a second attempt immediately even after the failed attempt, I was not physically and mentally prepared for it again.\n\nThats when I met Dr.Rajesh Verma at Bliss Acupuncture, Vadapalani in November 2019. After talking in detail about my experience and going through my health reports, Dr. Rajesh Verma guided to me undergo an Acupuncture session for a period of 6 months and assured me that I will definitely get pregnant before the completion of this 6 months. It was a 15 day session every month and I also took combination medicines that he suggested along with Acupuncture to improve my overall immunity and better health and fertility. Doctor assured me that I could naturally conceive and if by chance needed also I could try for IUI option and definitely not in need for IVF as I had age and my fertility level was satisfactory. \n\nWith all the confidence that Dr. Rajesh gave me and the best Acupuncture treatment that I got from him and the blessings of the almighty I got pregnant in March 2020. Owing to my time constraint I opted for IUI for my pregnancy. I got pregnant in IUI in my first attempt. \n\nI am now a happy mom to a BABY BOY. I cannot thank Dr. Rajesh Verma enough for the happiness that I am enjoying today being a mother. I should say, he diagnosed where my problem was and treated me exactly. His accuracy in the treatment is excellent. I highly recommend other people who are trying for pregnancy or not able to get pregnant to have an opinion with Dr.Rajesh Verma before choosing any hasty options as he genuinely guides you in the right path.\n\nThank you Dr.Rajesh Verma for we are forever Indebted to you for the happy parenthood we are enjoying today.

Our goal is to provide best treatment, exceptional care to all of our patients. Thanks for mentioning very friendly.  We have spent appropriate time for consultation ie. more than 30 minutes for diagnosis and providing treatment for your problems and i had explained that there is no known side effects for sexual ayurvedic medicines which were given by us. And till date no patient has complained about it. You had called within 3 days after consultation and once again explained that you had to take (one of the sos medicines ) one to two capsules per week but on the contrary you took 3 capsules in 3 days continuously and after that you stopped taking our medicines. You should have visited us for gastric problem. And for your information it takes time for ayurvedic medicines to work or show any effect. However you are cured now. Good wishes.",

But there was no improvement until I came across this doctor. The doctor is very friendly with kids and listened to all our problems carefully and patiently. He gave one hour of his previous time in the first day. I am very happy with his treatment and have got results in less than a month for speech, absent seizure and spasm. Now she is speaking many words understands and even she walks very well. The consultation and treatment charges very resonable as mention for the problems she had. I would have saved lakhs of money if i would known him 8 yrs before. I strongly recommended his names to all my family and friends. ",

While we were very eager to start a family, I could not get pregnant as easily as I thought. Myself and my husband were living abroad and were quite hesitant to start with any fertility treatment hastily without any proper guidance. \nHence, I came down to India in 2018 for a health checkup at a renowned hospital in Chetpet, Chennai. After a master checkup, the chief doctor there performed Hysterolaproscopy for a left  tubal disconnection. Also, later I was told that I could get pregnant only through IVF. With no other option left and without asking any 2nd opinion, I underwent all the procedures for IVF. Finally at the end of the IVF procedure, after embryo transplant , it was sad to know that I did not conceive. It was so harrowing to experience that feel, because emotionally and financially it was quite a loss for us. Though the IVF doctor asked me to go for a second attempt immediately even after the failed attempt, I was not physically and mentally prepared for it again.\n\nThats when I met Dr.Rajesh Verma at Bliss Acupuncture, Vadapalani in November 2019. After talking in detail about my experience and going through my health reports, Dr. Rajesh Verma guided to me undergo an Acupuncture session for a period of 6 months and assured me that I will definitely get pregnant before the completion of this 6 months. It was a 15 day session every month and I also took combination medicines that he suggested along with Acupuncture to improve my overall immunity and better health and fertility. Doctor assured me that I could naturally conceive and if by chance needed also I could try for IUI option and definitely not in need for IVF as I had age and my fertility level was satisfactory. \n\nWith all the confidence that Dr. Rajesh gave me and the best Acupuncture treatment that I got from him and the blessings of the almighty I got pregnant in March 2020. Owing to my time constraint I opted for IUI for my pregnancy. I got pregnant in IUI in my first attempt. \n\nI am now a happy mom to a BABY BOY. I cannot thank Dr. Rajesh Verma enough for the happiness that I am enjoying today being a mother. I should say, he diagnosed where my problem was and treated me exactly. His accuracy in the treatment is excellent. I highly recommend other people who are trying for pregnancy or not able to get pregnant to have an opinion with Dr.Rajesh Verma before choosing any hasty options as he genuinely guides you in the right path.\n\nThank you Dr.Rajesh Verma for we are forever Indebted to you for the happy parenthood we are enjoying today.

Our goal is to provide best treatment, exceptional care to all of our patients. Thanks for mentioning very friendly.  We have spent appropriate time for consultation ie. more than 30 minutes for diagnosis and providing treatment for your problems and i had explained that there is no known side effects for sexual ayurvedic medicines which were given by us. And till date no patient has complained about it. You had called within 3 days after consultation and once again explained that you had to take (one of the sos medicines ) one to two capsules per week but on the contrary you took 3 capsules in 3 days continuously and after that you stopped taking our medicines. You should have visited us for gastric problem. And for your information it takes time for ayurvedic medicines to work or show any effect. However you are cured now. Good wishes.",

But there was no improvement until I came across this doctor. The doctor is very friendly with kids and listened to all our problems carefully and patiently. He gave one hour of his previous time in the first day. I am very happy with his treatment and have got results in less than a month for speech, absent seizure and spasm. Now she is speaking many words understands and even she walks very well. The consultation and treatment charges very resonable as mention for the problems she had. I would have saved lakhs of money if i would known him 8 yrs before. I strongly recommended his names to all my family and friends. ",

The situation escalated suddenly as I had Diarrhoea and vomiting for another 3 times within an hour. I was completely dehydrated. We returned back home immediately and I called Dr. Rajesh over phone to explain my situation. He was at his residence. Right away, he prescribed me with an anti-diarrhreal and anti-vomitting tablet as a first aid. And within an hour he drove all the way from his residence to his Vadapalani clinic and handed over me \"A Drops\", an amazing drops that works like magic curing you. He asked me to mix the drops in a glass of water and take it before my each meal for that day. It worked wonders and I was completely cured by the end of the day.\nDr. Rajesh has a thorough knowledge of all situations and he prescribes you with the best treatment. I have almost stopped going to allopathic doctors and reach out to Dr. Rajesh for all my needs. Thank you doctor.",

Irrespective of the treatment effectiveness any treatment using alternative medicines is never so costly. Despite repeated reminder to doctor i am yet to get the prescription though in one of the feedbacks earlier doctor has mentioned that prescriptions are sent to customers over mail i feel this is not practiced at all in reality since there is no response to my repeated two reminders. Transparency is treatment either with respect to medicines prescribed or their costing  is completely missing. After paying Rs. 4000 for medicines and 500 for consultation, all that a patient can only hope is he will get well soon.",

I met Dr Rajesh Verma and he said to me that dont worry I will take care. Dr did acupuncture within minutes my BP was normal and I could raise my hand very freely without strain.

I was hoping to have a long term Doctor/Patient relationship. \nAs you know you were suffering for the last 14 years from chronic back pain, sciatica and immobility as you discussed on the first day of your visit. You told that you had visited many doctors but their treatment didn\u2019t help you much. So you had come to us after going through our positive comments in practo.\n\nAs Explained to you on day one of your treatment\n\n1.\tYour condition is very chronic and after the basic sessions you will have to take the maintenance session for 1 yr for which you agreed and the treatment was started with your consent. You completed your basic session and got relieved of pain and inspite of my advice for not riding a two wheeler you injured yourselves  while riding a bike. However your deteriorated condition was taken care of promptly. And you got rid of your pain once again. Thereafter you have not followed our protocol as suggested for maintenance sessions and had stop coming without any information for the last one month. However, you have last visited me on 12 May  and you commented that I discussed now about further  treatment of 1 yr which is not true.  And Again I informed not to travel in two wheeler  you have not followed my suggestion and was travelling as a pillion on your brother\u2019s bike.\n \n2.\tIn your feedback you have written that I have always been late for your treatment but let me remind you have sometimes reached prior to your appointment for your monetary benefits from OLA cab and rescheduling the timing according to your convenience but still I accommodated you even during my lunch hours. However you don\u2019t want to be transparent and wanted to defame me with wrong allegations. For your information I have done a lot of free medical camps for the poor and needy people (who can\u2019t afford). This I didn\u2019t want to mention to you cos you will not understand \u201cwhat is a feeling of being a Doctor\u201d.\n\n\n3.\t You have also commented about medicinal marketing done by our centre. Let me tell you consultation fees of Rs 500 is clearly mentioned in practo. Secondly one hour acupuncture session with fresh needles additional cost of needles Rs 100 was informed and as you have agreed also.  If I have all my information of practice in practo ie consultation charges with treatments you call  \u201cMedicinal marketing\u201d  but for many other patients it is a boon that they have come to our clinic with reference, feedbacks and content published from Practo. I take my profession seriously and only if you had been equally serious about your treatment your condition would have been better now. \n\nNo regrets and hoping that you get rid of your pain soon.",

You are comparing the cost with the efficiency of the medicines. As alternative system works on the root cause of the disease it takes some more time then modern medicine as it works on symptoms effectively in the management of many  health issues like Hypertension, Insomnia etc. I have understood from your feedback that you have taken allopathy for 4 or 5 months approx Rs. 10000 thereafter and you felt better.  We also sometimes recommend to consult doctors in case of hypertension or in acute conditions to take modern medicine as we do encourage other system of medicine given by doctors for relieving of symptoms faster. However we cannot compare the system/therapy with cost and duration as benefits depends on many factors like lifestyle,  diet,  season change etc. I am happy that you got well and cure for all the above conditions.\n\nRegards\nBliss Medicare Centre ",

I had sent the prescription and bill on 2nd September 2017, If you haven't received the mail I will send again and i apologise that you haven't received it.\nAsthma is very chronic disease and it is not possible to get relief in 40 days. We have to assess your condition after three months of treatment to know for improvement and the medicines prescribed were taken in time or any other condition to be taken care for better results. Surely we will help you in this regard. In your 2nd visit you have not taken medicines as we have suggested. You have not come on 1st week of this month to collect the remaining medicines and only taken medication partly. However please take the medicines regularly as prescribed. I remember that you said some relief in dry cough in the first course of medicines, when taken properly. But now you comment that there is no relief. I am glad that you are visiting this month for continuing the treatment after the conversation over phone we had today.  I have sent again the prescription. \n\nHope you get relief at the earliest\n\nRegards\nDr Rajesh Verma DR",

As we take complete history of the patient by not only pulse diagnosis but also try to find the sign and symptoms of the disease by questioning and suggesting further test. There are various causes for Loss of appetite including psychological factors like Stress, Anxiety, Depression, loss of taste, bloating, chronic illness, ill effects of medication etc. You, in any case, had not agreed with any of the above reasons for your problem and you insisted that you have already got the endoscopy done few months back which was not reproduced at the time of consultation... That\u2019s the reason why I suggested further investigation before starting any treatment. However, If u have done latest test and there is no issues... It is a good sign.\nRegards\n Dr Rajesh Verma",

Now  once again you have come after 2 1/2 months for ankle injury (mild fracture) with swelling which was due to your participation in Live show of Mr & Mrs Khiladi (Zee Tamil) as you had fallen from 40 feet height.  I saw good improvement in 2 session of acupuncture in your ankle injury with no pain and swelling. It is good to know that you did not develop sciatica again. Please take care and may god bless you.\n \nBest of luck for your daring act in live show.",
