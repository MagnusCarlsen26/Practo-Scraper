,,0,0,YES,"I & my wife have been Mansoor sir patient for the last 2-3 yrs.  
Have been visiting him few times in a year and every time he makes sure to understand my issue and takes time to diagnosis and keeps you comfortable. He does not provide you with many test but provides lots of life style changes and makes sure to enquire about the same in your next visit.
