"Wait time,",,0,0,YES,"Parents be careful if you are getting your child vaccinated at Rainbow hospital. I visited Rainbow Hyderabad to get my child vaccinated for 6weeks dose.

At pharmacy I identified they are using vaccines 2 years old which has a life of just 3 years.

I asked MOD and Mr Deepak vaccine incharge about this, and I was surprised to find they don't have vaccines other than 2 years old and they are using this lot only for all over India.

I am looking at other place for vaccine now.",2020-11-21 18:03:59,False,True,Shashank Shrivastava,,,
