"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Sinusitis,",0,0,YES,"Dr. A is absolutely terrific in how he explains the diagnosis based on your symptoms. He never stops asking questions which is rare to find in most doctors today.

He also recommended me to a specialist to get a detailed look into my issues.
