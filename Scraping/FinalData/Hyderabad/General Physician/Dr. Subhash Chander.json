I've consulted other doctors and they diagnosed it as Taenia Corporis but i couldn't find proper treatment for two years and had a terrible time with the infection. It was badly itchy and uncomfortable, I had to avoid certain food and other habits, I had to change my clothing and it was a pretty bad experience.\n\nAnd then I got to know about Dr. Subhash Chander of the new life advanced homeo care the new life advanced homeo and I consulted with him and he gave a medication which i continued for an year and as bad as the experience was before using homeopathy, things turned out that good gradually. The medicines cured the skin infection completely around the waist and the skin is back to normal now. since then i didn't get any recurring infections on any part of the body. Whatever the health issues are, no matter how worse they are, i can recommend new life advanced homeo care with pretty great hope and confidence.",

Biopsy revealed,\u00a0Lichen planus condition. An autoimmune disorder. Its cause and treatment are not known to science\u00a0yet.In 2023 summer visited India. Upon recommendation of my family, have seen Dr Subhash Chander,\u00a0whom they have seen in the past and very happy with the results. Dr Subhash Chander has viewed skin condition\u00a0and started treatment, within 2 weeks, I have noticed slight difference. Six weeks into treatment\u00a0there was drastic improvement in visual appearance. Now it's been close to 3 months into treatment\u00a0and the issue has resolved with 70% clearer skin. Upon returning back to\u00a0USA and during follow-up\u00a0appointment with Dermatologist, he was surprised to see the skin.\u00a0Thanks to Dr Subhash Chander\u00a0and I would highly recommend him for any type of health issues.",

They were puzzled and discharged me in a helpless state When at home my relatives came and advised me to go to NIMS again.They restudied my case and diagnosed my paralysis as a manifestation of Guillain Barre Syndrome .Then I started having repeated  vomitings with burning in chest.On examination they found an ulcer in my stomach.Vomitings increased and the intake of food was lost and they were forced to give me IV feeds that again led to increase in breathlessness.This complicated nature of my illness frightened the doctors and they hinted a discharge .We also accepted for a discharge as they were not assuring any recovery and as we have already spent an amount of Rs 12 lakhs During the past 9 months and I got discharged.After that luckily my brother in law identified a good Homeopathic doctor named Dr Subhas Chandar of NEW LIFE HOMEO CARE of Bowenpally.He went through all the record and started his homeopathic medicines.\nIn four days my breathlessness disappeared and swelling decreased very much and in just 10 days my other problems like weakness in limbs vomitings burning pain disappeared.My urine output increased ,my appetite improved and I was able walk freely in my house without any difficulty.My power in the limbs has improved by 80 percent.I am active and happy.Thanks for the excellent treatment.",

It all started when my mother was diagnosed with cirrhotic liver infected with HCV and i was running high and dry when almost all hospital started telling me that only way to save life of my mother is \"liver transplant ' which is not only exorbitantly expensive but also had many other challenges like finding a donor and management of post surgery complication . ON the top of everything was the uncertainty of the efficacy of the whole procedure of transplant.  It was under such circumstances when i got introduced to Dr Subhash Chander and he helped me in a great way in fighting the disease by constantly monitoring (telephonically) the condition of my mother and advising on various combination of homeopathic medicines whenever the condition was being critical . Through a treatment which is still continued  for last six years my mother today is far better , her virus has disappeared , pathology is far improved . I wish i was living in the same city as Dr Subhash Chander to save the trouble of bothering him sometime in the middle of night to discuss the complication and medicines. ",

His way of treatment and counseling have wonderful impact.\nWhen I visited first time to Dr. Subhas Chandar through some reference, I was suffering from lot of problems related to stomach. Earlier I consulted almost all the best known gastroentrolgists of Hyderabad including Dr Nageswar Reddy of Asian Institute of Gastroentrology. Even after taking the treatment for almost 8 months I was not getting the relief from my problems. Some doctor told that I was suffering from IBS, some doctor told it is hytus hernia etc. I even consulted homeopathic doctors and was taking homeopathic medicine. Sometimes initial improvements were there but it was reccuring again and again.\nFinally I was referred to Dr Subhas by some friend. After starting the treatment here a lot of improvements are there. Till date the treatment is continued but improvement is remarkable.\nMy two kids are also under Dr Subhas Sir's treatment and improvements are remarkable. I have also referred many patients about Dr Subhas. This itself shows our satisfaction and confidence with Dr Subhas Chandra.\n\n\n",

All the medications provided temporary relief. Even expert doctors are of the opinion that GBS has no cure. They opined that only the present condition can be maintained with continuous physiotherapy.\n      After meeting Dr Subash Chander, we got a feeling that this treatment is different from others. We experienced the same after we started medication. We could experience a sudden improvement in her health condition after the first dose of medication itself which is very rare in Homeopathy. We are presently undergoing the course. Will also review after the end of the treatment.\n\n     The treatment provided by Dr Subhash is unique. Suggest this treatment to everyone. The clinic is especially meant for difficult and non-curable diseases.\n",

They were puzzled and discharged me in a helpless state When at home my relatives came and advised me to go to NIMS again.They restudied my case and diagnosed my paralysis as a manifestation of Guillain Barre Syndrome .Then I started having repeated  vomitings with burning in chest.On examination they found an ulcer in my stomach.Vomitings increased and the intake of food was lost and they were forced to give me IV feeds that again led to increase in breathlessness.This complicated nature of my illness frightened the doctors and they hinted a discharge .We also accepted for a discharge as they were not assuring any recovery and as we have already spent an amount of Rs 12 lakhs During the past 9 months and I got discharged.After that luckily my brother in law identified a good Homeopathic doctor named Dr Subhas Chandar of NEW LIFE HOMEO CARE of Bowenpally.He went through all the record and started his homeopathic medicines.\nIn four days my breathlessness disappeared and swelling decreased very much and in just 10 days my other problems like weakness in limbs vomitings burning pain disappeared.My urine output increased ,my appetite improved and I was able walk freely in my house without any difficulty.My power in the limbs has improved by 80 percent.I am active and happy.Thanks for the excellent treatment.",

ON the top of everything was the uncertainty of the efficacy of the whole procedure of transplant.  It was under such circumstances when i got introduced to Dr Subhash Chander and he helped me in a great way in fighting the disease by constantly monitoring (telephonically) the condition of my mother and advising on various combination of homeopathic medicines whenever the condition was being critical . Through a treatment which is still continued  for last six years my mother today is far better , her virus has disappeared , pathology is far improved . I wish i was living in the same city as Dr Subhash Chander to save the trouble of bothering him sometime in the middle of night to discuss the complication and medicines. ",

Even after taking the treatment for almost 8 months I was not getting the relief from my problems. Some doctor told that I was suffering from IBS, some doctor told it is hytus hernia etc. I even consulted homeopathic doctors and was taking homeopathic medicine. Sometimes initial improvements were there but it was reccuring again and again.\nFinally I was referred to Dr Subhas by some friend. After starting the treatment here a lot of improvements are there. Till date the treatment is continued but improvement is remarkable.\nMy two kids are also under Dr Subhas Sir's treatment and improvements are remarkable. I have also referred many patients about Dr Subhas. This itself shows our satisfaction and confidence with Dr Subhas Chandra.\n\n\n",

All the medications provided temporary relief. Even expert doctors are of the opinion that GBS has no cure. They opined that only the present condition can be maintained with continuous physiotherapy.\n      After meeting Dr Subash Chander, we got a feeling that this treatment is different from others. We experienced the same after we started medication. We could experience a sudden improvement in her health condition after the first dose of medication itself which is very rare in Homeopathy. We are presently undergoing the course. Will also review after the end of the treatment.\n\n     The treatment provided by Dr Subhash is unique. Suggest this treatment to everyone. The clinic is especially meant for difficult and non-curable diseases.\n",

But there was no significant benefit.\nI knew Subhash Sir from before for Covid19 treatment, so I contacted him. I informed him about my father's problems. He came to know about my father's every problem. Dr. Subhash of New life homeo clinic at Hyderabad reviewed all of the reports and administered the medication. Now it has been three months with his homeopathic treatment. My father has undergone a transformation. He is recovering from all his health issues. Both the creatinine. and sugar levels are now normal. He miraculously recovered in three months and is much active and enjoying the recovery.\nMany thanks to Dr. Subash Sir.",

He is a great personality and very kind hearted. I visited each and every reputed Homeo hospitals in Hyd and spent lot of money on my 20 years of Asthma, Allergy and nasal blockage problems but I didn't get correct treatment anywhere but after visiting and taking 1 month medication from Dr. Subhash Chander sir I can easily understand the difference between my years of Homeo medication from other reputed hospitals and New Life Homeo Care. Even I have taken treatment for COVID-19 and recovered within 2 days though I am a chronic asthmatic patient. Thanks a ton to New Life Homeo Care. ",

I hope the doctor can make it a little more affordable for middle class to afford proper homeopathy treatment. I'm a little disheartened with the charges. Hoping the medicines will work well and last for a month at least.\n\n",

Doctor enquired me about my medical history right from childhood, about my mental features. He spoke to me for about 2 hours which is remarkable. He instilled confidence in me that I'd be fine. I've been using his homeo medicines for 2months now and my symptoms are gradually getting better. My breathlessness has improved remarkable.I'd definitely recommend Dr. Subash Chander for chronic illnesses.",

My tsh levels improved and came in to control in first three weeks which was not possible even after taking 150 mcg of levothyroxine before the start of homeopathy treatment.I had complications like anxiety, confusion,memory loss ,fatigue  all due to the problems caused by my thyroid gland.Now  I am free of all those complications and my levothyroxine dose came down to 50mcg  and TSH level 0.8 and I am waiting for the complete cure of hashimoto thyroiditis and TPO levels which is very much possible.We are happy having met Dr.Subhash Chander and having found a solution for my problem which doesn't have any solution in allopathy.Thank you Doctor!!",

I used to get  10 to 11 stools per day and was not able to eat even one idli,I was scared to go out of my home.\n I lost my health and weight. My weight reached as low as 35 kg.\nExperts examined and told that there were multiple polyps in my colon that has no known treatment. I was resigned to suffer from the problem for life. People thought I could live for a few months only.Meanwhile our colony president identified Dr Subhash Chander, a homeopathic expert and we sought his help in March 2022. With his homeopathic medicine my problem  of diarrhea  safely and gradually subsided and have reached a healthy state now. I am able to eat and carry on my daily activities as a normal person. My colony mates are amazed to see my fast recovery.My weight is now 62 kg.I thank Dr Subhash Chandra for restoring  my health.",

Also I was Suffering with Dust allergy for the past 7 years nothing(allopathy and various homeo from other doctors) has worked. I completely fed up with my allergy and lost hope that this will continue life long. One day I strongly decided to investigate why this allergy is affecting me then one fine day I started reasearching good doctors again. During my reasearch I heard about life science homeopathy. Intially I dont have trust because of my last experiences anyhow decided to take one more try with life science. Trust me this doctor has vanished my 7 years of dust allergy problem in week. I was flabbergasted and felt very happy. Finally I found a true doctor. He is the only one can solve mostly all the problems in a very systematic manner. I strongly recommend everyone to take a test if you have any problems.",
