Though we reached on time . Nobody was there there is no place to wait also. We called the doctors he said he will in 30 minutes and since there was no place to sit also we went to nearby coffees shop to pass time. When we came back doctor had not come but clinic had opened. They did look at appointment but randomly assigned people numbers. \n\nConsultation was ok . He did something with a machine and when we came out receptionist says you have to pay 2000 for that test which turned out to be 2d echo. It was like not told before. There were two tests written . In total we had to shell 5000 rs for just one visit. I am 30 and I have slight bp problem . **** ** ***** ******** ***** *** ******* *** ***** **** ******Because as soon we got out the rep was there and asked if he could see the prescription. We did not know before but later realised. The medicine was not available in the next medicine. We came back but doctors had left . The medical rep says then I suggested it will come in a day or two. Next few days we tried multiple pharmacies apollo , medplus etc but could find. Though the doctors said we can contact on whatsapp he did reply and my earlier medicine was finishing. He did not take calls. Finally we had to give and go back to previous doctors. Those 5000 rs went down the drain and caused lot of trouble and tension for an already bp patient. Not recommended all reviews seem paid to me and look same.",

In true sense a doctor who is doing justice to his responsibility. thank you doctor Ganesh. i feel better with the treatment you had provided. my gratitude.",

Though we reached on time . Nobody was there there is no place to wait also. We called the doctors he said he will in 30 minutes and since there was no place to sit also we went to nearby coffees shop to pass time. When we came back doctor had not come but clinic had opened. They did look at appointment but randomly assigned people numbers. \n\nConsultation was ok . He did something with a machine and when we came out receptionist says you have to pay 2000 for that test which turned out to be 2d echo. It was like not told before. There were two tests written . In total we had to shell 5000 rs for just one visit. I am 30 and I have slight bp problem . **** ** ***** ******** ***** *** ******* *** ***** **** ******Because as soon we got out the rep was there and asked if he could see the prescription. We did not know before but later realised. The medicine was not available in the next medicine. We came back but doctors had left . The medical rep says then I suggested it will come in a day or two. Next few days we tried multiple pharmacies apollo , medplus etc but could find. Though the doctors said we can contact on whatsapp he did reply and my earlier medicine was finishing. He did not take calls. Finally we had to give and go back to previous doctors. Those 5000 rs went down the drain and caused lot of trouble and tension for an already bp patient. Not recommended all reviews seem paid to me and look same.",

But he assured me that nothing would happen to me if I really follow his instructions. He initially put me on just 2 tabletsn after 6 months I found the results. From 160| 110 my bp has come down to 125| 78. And now he asked me to just take half a tablet per day n to do some physical  exercise . I am very glad I met an awesome doctor. Thanks to practo ppl for providing us genuine information online. its really hard to find such good doctors now a days. I recommend to all my friends n family. ",

This doctor used to visit karimnagar once in a month. But so many people told that he has a great hand in treating patients. I came all the way from karimnagar to consult him. I am really happy to ring a good doctor. He advised to change my food habits n  lifestyle n sleep timings. He told me if parents have bp sugar it doesn't mean children get it. He told me I got it because of my life style n food. He gave me confidence that I am a very healthy person very soon. This I my second visit. Now my bp has come down near to normal. N sugar random is 125. In the next visit I shall give u full read back about my health. I think this will be more useful for ppl like me who doesn't stay in Hyderabad n who doesn't know good doctors. Without benefit of doubt u can consult him.",

Ganesh who is very genuine n ethical. He treats as per ur problem. He gives mental support. He guides abouttlaking daily habits. He puts his entire dedication in treating a person. If we call him for any doubt anytime he answers n he remembers all our past case history. He is a genius n caring. My bp is now around 125\\83. Such an improvement I never found in the past 13 years.

But I realised the other doctors never gave more than 10 min for consultation. But with Ganesh sir I could sit with him n explain all my complaints n clear all my doubts.

It was very difficult to find the clinic first of all as there is no board and google map confused us further . After 2-3 rounds in Gulmohar colony we asked a medical store about the doctor. They mentioned he sits on the first floor but the clinic is closed . I told them I have an appointment with him ... they asked us to wait for 30 mins as doctor is on the way. We waited there ... there is no parking space either and we had to park our car on the road. Finally after 40 mins or so we were informed that the doctor is not coming and we need to come on Monday. This was ridiculous. We tried to contact the number given and no one picks the call. Later when we left the place (obviously disgusted) we get a call that please come on Monday between 5-7 pm . \nI don\u2019t think doctors should behave so irresponsibly and show some kind of ownership towards their patients.

I thought he was just like any other doctor advising these things for money n I ignored. But later I had a severe dificuilty at work place n I fainted. Then I visited Dr. Ganesh n he did angiography n found I had 2 major blocks n did angioplasty. I am surprised to find 90% blocks at this age.I am really great full to Dr. Ganesh for recognising my problem at the earliest  n keeping me alive today. 100% I would recommend him to you as a eat doctor I have ever seen. :-) ",

I decided to wait for doctor to turn up at 11 am with my father (75 years old). Doctor did not turn up, waited till 11:15 am. Either practo is at fault or doctor is unprofessional. I reached out practo for help, they stated to contact me back after consulting doctor in 5 mins. No call back from practo.
