He also suggested some valuable life style changes which helped me a lot in coping up with my Asthma.  Thank God I found a Doctor who could understand my condition and gave permanent solutions rather than temporary relief.\n",

He also suggested some valuable life style changes which helped me a lot in coping up with my Asthma.  Thank God I found a Doctor who could understand my condition and gave permanent solutions rather than temporary relief.\n",
