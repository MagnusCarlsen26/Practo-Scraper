She did not advice anything more than required and made 100% clear about the expectations after the procedure. She listened through all the issues patiently and suggested the best can be done in current situation. I have not seen an iota of arrogance in her ** * **** *** ************* ******* She was being open to requests/suggestions from the patient. She always focused on long term cure of an issue.

She listened through all the issues patiently and suggested the best can be done in current situation. I have not seen an iota of arrogance in her ** * **** *** ************* ******* She was being open to requests/suggestions from the patient. She always focused on long term cure of an issue.
