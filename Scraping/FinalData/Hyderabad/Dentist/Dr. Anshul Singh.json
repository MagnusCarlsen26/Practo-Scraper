The medical procedure was explained well and post treatment care as well as the next steps in the procedure was explained in detail by the doctor. \n\nThe doctors in this clinic have good connections with various specialists as well.

It was amazing to see how well both the doctors calmed me down and patiently worked with me and my paranoia ...\n\nThe orthodontist assigned for me was brilliant! He was gentle and very systematic and organized. The medical procedure was explained well and post treatment care as well as the next steps in the procedure was explained in detail by the doctor. \n\nThe doctors in this clinic have good connections with various specialists as well. I must say after this, my faith in dentists has been restored. Thank you very much. \n\nRegards,\nVaishnavi Shankar",

My surgeon, Dr. Kiran extracted my infected lower wisdom tooth and the procedure was so smooth that I asked him to remove the upper wisdom tooth too, which was halfway inside the gum and had cavity. I am very happy with the treatment. Also, the doctors and the staff, especially Dr. Anshul kept a regular check on me until the removal of sutures and complete recovery.",
