"Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Doctor friendliness,Value for money,Wait time,",,0,0,YES,"I am from Khammam District and on my colleague's suggestion I had visited 'The Dental Specialists' (Banjara Hills) to undergo treatment for dental cyst. Initially Dr. Ayesha investigated and elaborated the underlying issue to me through digital X-rays and specified number of sittings needed for the treatment. Later,Dr. Chaitrika did RCT (laser) followed by crown placing by Dr.Apoorva. Both the Doctors are very professional & did thier job meticulously and answered all my queires patiently. During entire treatment, I have not taken single medicine/pain-killer which obviously signifies how flawless the treatment was. Moreover,the Hospital ambience is so pleasant to wait till my turn comes and the front desk staff are very cordial. The most appreciable thing is that they have fixed appointments (of four sittings) as per my schedule (as I need to come from Khammam for every sitting).
