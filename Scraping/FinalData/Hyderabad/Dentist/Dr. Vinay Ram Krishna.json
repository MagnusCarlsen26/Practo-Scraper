And I must say I was really lucky to have visited Dr Vinay for this. The tooth had cracked under previous RCT crown, and it had to be carefully extracted surgically. The whole procedure went smooth and almost pain free and recovery/healing was great. Why I would highly recommend Dr Vinay to anyone seeking dental help -\n- Straightforward & clear in his approach & thinking\n- Super quick in diagnostics and recommends the right line of treatment\n- very friendly, reachable on phone, accessible/ approachable. You're in safe hands with him\n- Careful & diligent during the procedure ensuring patient is kept informed and it goes smoothly\n\n",

Dr. Vinay has given me a clear explanation of the process and most importantly he gave me financial training with good clarity. I liked his way of explanation and proceeded further with the dental implant process. The whole process is done by the doctor himself and the team, and the process is painless and fast. They have well-equipped facilities with all state-of-the-art equipment. I highly recommend the clinic to my friends, and family.",

The whole procedure went smooth and almost pain free and recovery/healing was great. Why I would highly recommend Dr Vinay to anyone seeking dental help -\n- Straightforward & clear in his approach & thinking\n- Super quick in diagnostics and recommends the right line of treatment\n- very friendly, reachable on phone, accessible/ approachable. You're in safe hands with him\n- Careful & diligent during the procedure ensuring patient is kept informed and it goes smoothly\n\n",

I liked his way of explanation and proceeded further with the dental implant process. The whole process is done by the doctor himself and the team, and the process is painless and fast.

He has given me useful and practical suggestions about oral care. In one sitting, all my plaque is gone, and I felt amazing that the whole process is painless and took one and half hour only. Thank you, doctor. I highly recommend Dr. Vinay and his team for your dental problems.",

After checking my teeth, he said one of my teeth is in bad condition and going for removal is the best. The other tooth which was shaking too, he said that it was minor and just painkillers will do fine. He was right! The extraction was painless and I'm happy with that.
