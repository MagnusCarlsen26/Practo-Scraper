He is highly experienced having done additional courses, He is polite and punctual. He has a lot of patience and examines every patient in detail. He is available dot in time on the appointed time and date.In my subsequent visit he has removed a broken molar of my aged Aunt who has 'Shaking head syndrome' and could not remain at rest even after her best efforts, He has performed the entire procedure very precisely and with great expertise and a great responsibility.I am personally very grateful to him for undertaking such a delicate work which most of the other Doctors have refused to undertake the responsibility to remove the decaying and broken molar. That event has proved his skills and his urge to help and serve the patients.This action of his makes him a distinct few in the present era. I may be excused to say that of late the medical profession  has transformed into a very Commercial practice, losing the dignity once attached to the profession. I certainly recommend his case to any one with dental problems, one can definitely rely upon his line of treatment and his diagnostic expertise. His pleasing manners and behavior also shows his respectable stature. I wish him all the best. He may have a good name at least in the Twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad of Telangana State. ",

I visited one of the dental hospital for the treatment and after examining my tooth they advised me to get both lower and upper tooth removed and go with dentures. Further a full mouth X-ray was also taken and told that there is no infection and hence root canal treatment is not required.  They prescribed only pain killers for the pain!!\nBeing diabetic, I was apprehensive of the pain when the all the upper and lower tooth are removed and could not proceed further with their suggestion and decided to go for second opinion to find whether this is \"the only\" solution for my case.   While browsing the internet for the good dental surgeons, I came across Dr.Razvi and I went to his clinic and explained my problem and shown him the X-ray.\nTo my surprise, he told me that tooth need not be removed completely and still can go with denture for the lower part which has given me courage to go ahead for the treatment.\nHe is a clam, simple, soft spoken and concern for the patient and understands their apprehensions and explain the problem to the patient and his solutions which are very convincing.  He is a thorough professional and perfectionist with lot of patience.  He diagnosed my problem quickly and having convinced with the solution proposed, I agreed to start  the treatment immediately.  I got relieved from the pain from the very second day without any further medicines.\nThe clinic is very clean, peaceful and supporting staff are very cordial.  He has removed only the wisdom teeth which was vertically broken and I got crowns for 8 teeth (starting from the molar 4 on each side which would help me to byte and chew) and lower tooth got trimmed to the gum level and denture is prepared. \nNow I am very happy as my tooth problem got   solved and hope to live peacefully for some more years.\nThank you so much Doctor Razvi,  for your wonderful treatment.\nI strongly recommend him if you have any serious problem with your tooth.  Just see him once if you are scared by others with their treatment suggestions !!!\n",

He has planned the entire treatment in three sittings, and commenced the treatment immediately, that relieved me of the pain from the same night. He is highly experienced having done additional courses, He is polite and punctual. He has a lot of patience and examines every patient in detail. He is available dot in time on the appointed time and date.In my subsequent visit he has removed a broken molar of my aged Aunt who has 'Shaking head syndrome' and could not remain at rest even after her best efforts, He has performed the entire procedure very precisely and with great expertise and a great responsibility.I am personally very grateful to him for undertaking such a delicate work which most of the other Doctors have refused to undertake the responsibility to remove the decaying and broken molar. That event has proved his skills and his urge to help and serve the patients.This action of his makes him a distinct few in the present era. I may be excused to say that of late the medical profession  has transformed into a very Commercial practice, losing the dignity once attached to the profession. I certainly recommend his case to any one with dental problems, one can definitely rely upon his line of treatment and his diagnostic expertise. His pleasing manners and behavior also shows his respectable stature. I wish him all the best. He may have a good name at least in the Twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad of Telangana State. ",

I visited one of the dental hospital for the treatment and after examining my tooth they advised me to get both lower and upper tooth removed and go with dentures. Further a full mouth X-ray was also taken and told that there is no infection and hence root canal treatment is not required.  They prescribed only pain killers for the pain!!\nBeing diabetic, I was apprehensive of the pain when the all the upper and lower tooth are removed and could not proceed further with their suggestion and decided to go for second opinion to find whether this is \"the only\" solution for my case.   While browsing the internet for the good dental surgeons, I came across Dr.Razvi and I went to his clinic and explained my problem and shown him the X-ray.\nTo my surprise, he told me that tooth need not be removed completely and still can go with denture for the lower part which has given me courage to go ahead for the treatment.\nHe is a clam, simple, soft spoken and concern for the patient and understands their apprehensions and explain the problem to the patient and his solutions which are very convincing.  He is a thorough professional and perfectionist with lot of patience.  He diagnosed my problem quickly and having convinced with the solution proposed, I agreed to start  the treatment immediately.  I got relieved from the pain from the very second day without any further medicines.\nThe clinic is very clean, peaceful and supporting staff are very cordial.  He has removed only the wisdom teeth which was vertically broken and I got crowns for 8 teeth (starting from the molar 4 on each side which would help me to byte and chew) and lower tooth got trimmed to the gum level and denture is prepared. \nNow I am very happy as my tooth problem got   solved and hope to live peacefully for some more years.\nThank you so much Doctor Razvi,  for your wonderful treatment.\nI strongly recommend him if you have any serious problem with your tooth.  Just see him once if you are scared by others with their treatment suggestions !!!\n",
