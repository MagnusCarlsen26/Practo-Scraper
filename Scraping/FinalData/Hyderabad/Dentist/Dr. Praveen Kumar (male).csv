"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Dental Implant Fixing,Implants(Fixed Teeth),Dental Implant,",0,0,YES,"I was searching for full mouth implant treatment  for my senior citizen parents close to my area and I came across Jodent.  I had absolutely no clue on how this treatment is undergone and Dr. Praveen explained very well initially and made me comfortable. It almost took close to 5-6 months to complete the entire treatment. Dr. Praveen was never in hurry and he took a good time to let my parents settle after every surgical process. The appointments were quite well planned and precautions during this covid time were also observed greatly.  He never was behind the money unlike other clinics but made sure the treatment goes well and patient satisfaction he kept as a primary goal. Always provided the right suggestions when we were worried after the surgical treatment. 

Both my mother and father are satisfied and very happy with the implants. Although they cannot speak local language they both were never hesitant to visit the clinic alone. Doctor made sure they are still comfortable. 

Only some of improvements i would suggest mainly during the surgical process.  Below are improvement around the surgical procedure.
1. Getting the X-rays was a big time struggle for both my parents though my mother had gaggling issue.  So some alternative which can be improvised and make the process little easier.

2. There was a little more time taken during first treatment to find the right size of implant however was already improvised with the subsequent appointments.
3. Try and avoid to keep longer threads after the stitches. Also if the x-ray chip can be cleaned a little more frequently before taking x-ray. I know sometimes its difficult to do that but just a suggestion. 

4. Only one instance which really worried me was the one when there was already an implant placed and was plucked hard and the other one was placed in. There was a lot of bleeding for my mother. Though Doctor Praveen again gave the right suggestions and that reduced the worry and at the end was all fine. 
It was a long journey of treatment as both my mother and father were getting treated. Overall an experience with Dr Praveen and the entire staff was very pleasing and satisfying. I would definitely recommend Doctor Praveen the way he treats and make his patients comfortable. 
My parents have the same say as well. :)
