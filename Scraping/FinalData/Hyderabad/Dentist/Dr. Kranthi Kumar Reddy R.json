The office environment was child-friendly, which helped alleviate any anxiety. We are grateful for Dr. Kranthi's expertise and compassionate care. Highly recommended for pediatric dental services!\\",

We went for the purpose of getting braces done as my son has some crooked teeth and lot of gaps in between teeth and he is about 13 years old. But to our surprise the doctor asked us questions about our son's sleep quality as he found him to be sleepy and sluggish, which was all true. We have had this issue with him for sometime and we have even shown to well known pediatric neuro etc but no one ever suggested a sleep study to be conducted or a CT of airways etc. From a dentist it was least expected and we actually did the sleep study as recommended by Dr kranti and it turned out that our son has sleep apnea. Dr kranti suggested further investigation with ENT specialist etc , he dint rush us to get the braces done- which he cud have. But he said lets get this sorted out first and braces can be done later. he dint even charge us for the review session. He is a gem and we strongly  recommend him . God bless you doctor",

Intact the GEM of dentists..\nLemme explain ..this the scenario of the dentists treatment for  a five year old kid \nI was skeptical to visit the clinic in the beginning as I have had many bad experiences for my kid with many other dentists (the way they try to force or scare the child to get the treatment done ..maybe it's their way of treating kids which I'm totally against to , as a dentist myself and as a mother too .).so ultimately I didn't let such weird treatment methods to be applied on my kid for her treatment ..so it's been around two years that I have been searching for a kid friendly dentist who vl not leave a scar of dental treatment being a nightmare in kids and luckily I found Dr.Kranthi sir ..yeah as I told in the beginning I was skeptical at the first visit ...but after he diagnosed the issue of cavities in my kid's mouth  , she was not at all uncomfortable ..he did it with such ease as if my kid and the Dr have been friends for ages ...then coming to the treatment part ..my kid has got deep cavities on her molars(5) for which the pulp therapy and capping was done ..trust me she didn't cry at any appointment regarding the treatment not even the injection scared her (which is hard to believe for many parents out here ..yes it is true ))..yeah for one appointment there was some sleepy mode I guess which made my kid irritable jus a bit but the entire treatment was hassle free and any parent can take their kid regarding dental issues without giving a second thought ..the best part is he never letz any procedure take more than 15mins and that's how his expertise treatment plan will be for sure (which most of the dentists fail to do ) ..I can go on saying for ages ...because as a mother I know what mental trauma I have gone through before finding one good dentist for my kid ...the Dr is bothered about the emotions of the child be it fear or anxiety or stress regarding the dental treatment and he treats accordingly which most people fail to do ..he never suggests unwanted treatments or treatments that are uncomfortable to the child..Its been almost 8months that I got the treatment done for my kid and no complaints since then ..my kid is able to eat anything she wants without fear of dental pain or food getting stuck in the cavities (which were the major concerns before treatment )I can say he is nothing less in caring for your kid just as any parent does for their children \nOK to make it short I vl list out the best of the clinic here for quick view to any parent who are in search of  a good dentist for their kids\n-Kid friendly dentist\n-Excellent work ethics\n-Concerned about kid's health and fear too \n-Least waiting time \n-Least time on dental chair \n-No unnecessary treatment plans \n-Genuine treatment that lasts a lifetime \n-Good staff and well maintained clinic hygiene \n\nThank you practice for suggesting this clinic and I wholeheartedly thank the entire team present at the clinic and I can say I can never thank the Dr enough in my life ..\ud83d\ude4fThank You  sir Thank You so much ...",

During our trip to Hyderabad we got in touch with Dr. Kranthi.  He is a true professional and a keen listener. Having listened to us and assessed the situation in a comprehensive manner he suggested the solution of rehabilitation. We also felt he is good at dealing with kids and their psychology. The best part is he knows his limits as a dental expert and carries out major dental surgeries in a pediatric theater under supervision of pediatric experts in association with a children's hospital. This reduces any risk and emergency procedures if needed.\r\n\r\nHe had implanted 4 aesthetic and 4 steel crowns for my kid and my kid is doing fine. The only care that has to be taken is to ensure the kids don't mess with the aesthetic crowns as they are not as hard as the steel ones.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find an pediatric expert in this field as you have dentists sitting in every lane in Indian cities. Luckily I have found one and I have no doubt whatsoever recommending his services to others.\r\nWishing healthy teeth and gums to everyone.!",

We went for the purpose of getting braces done as my son has some crooked teeth and lot of gaps in between teeth and he is about 13 years old. But to our surprise the doctor asked us questions about our son's sleep quality as he found him to be sleepy and sluggish, which was all true. We have had this issue with him for sometime and we have even shown to well known pediatric neuro etc but no one ever suggested a sleep study to be conducted or a CT of airways etc. From a dentist it was least expected and we actually did the sleep study as recommended by Dr kranti and it turned out that our son has sleep apnea. Dr kranti suggested further investigation with ENT specialist etc , he dint rush us to get the braces done- which he cud have. But he said lets get this sorted out first and braces can be done later. he dint even charge us for the review session. He is a gem and we strongly  recommend him . God bless you doctor",

Intact the GEM of dentists..\nLemme explain ..this the scenario of the dentists treatment for  a five year old kid \nI was skeptical to visit the clinic in the beginning as I have had many bad experiences for my kid with many other dentists (the way they try to force or scare the child to get the treatment done ..maybe it's their way of treating kids which I'm totally against to , as a dentist myself and as a mother too .).so ultimately I didn't let such weird treatment methods to be applied on my kid for her treatment ..so it's been around two years that I have been searching for a kid friendly dentist who vl not leave a scar of dental treatment being a nightmare in kids and luckily I found Dr.Kranthi sir ..yeah as I told in the beginning I was skeptical at the first visit ...but after he diagnosed the issue of cavities in my kid's mouth  , she was not at all uncomfortable ..he did it with such ease as if my kid and the Dr have been friends for ages ...then coming to the treatment part ..my kid has got deep cavities on her molars(5) for which the pulp therapy and capping was done ..trust me she didn't cry at any appointment regarding the treatment not even the injection scared her (which is hard to believe for many parents out here ..yes it is true ))..yeah for one appointment there was some sleepy mode I guess which made my kid irritable jus a bit but the entire treatment was hassle free and any parent can take their kid regarding dental issues without giving a second thought ..the best part is he never letz any procedure take more than 15mins and that's how his expertise treatment plan will be for sure (which most of the dentists fail to do ) ..I can go on saying for ages ...because as a mother I know what mental trauma I have gone through before finding one good dentist for my kid ...the Dr is bothered about the emotions of the child be it fear or anxiety or stress regarding the dental treatment and he treats accordingly which most people fail to do ..he never suggests unwanted treatments or treatments that are uncomfortable to the child..Its been almost 8months that I got the treatment done for my kid and no complaints since then ..my kid is able to eat anything she wants without fear of dental pain or food getting stuck in the cavities (which were the major concerns before treatment )I can say he is nothing less in caring for your kid just as any parent does for their children \nOK to make it short I vl list out the best of the clinic here for quick view to any parent who are in search of  a good dentist for their kids\n-Kid friendly dentist\n-Excellent work ethics\n-Concerned about kid's health and fear too \n-Least waiting time \n-Least time on dental chair \n-No unnecessary treatment plans \n-Genuine treatment that lasts a lifetime \n-Good staff and well maintained clinic hygiene \n\nThank you practice for suggesting this clinic and I wholeheartedly thank the entire team present at the clinic and I can say I can never thank the Dr enough in my life ..\ud83d\ude4fThank You  sir Thank You so much ...",

During our trip to Hyderabad we got in touch with Dr. Kranthi.  He is a true professional and a keen listener. Having listened to us and assessed the situation in a comprehensive manner he suggested the solution of rehabilitation. We also felt he is good at dealing with kids and their psychology. The best part is he knows his limits as a dental expert and carries out major dental surgeries in a pediatric theater under supervision of pediatric experts in association with a children's hospital. This reduces any risk and emergency procedures if needed.\r\n\r\nHe had implanted 4 aesthetic and 4 steel crowns for my kid and my kid is doing fine. The only care that has to be taken is to ensure the kids don't mess with the aesthetic crowns as they are not as hard as the steel ones.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find an pediatric expert in this field as you have dentists sitting in every lane in Indian cities. Luckily I have found one and I have no doubt whatsoever recommending his services to others.\r\nWishing healthy teeth and gums to everyone.!",

However, to my surprise, his checkup room is very children friendly with all toys around, and a good tv on the top to get kids attention. Doctor talked to kid for 5mins to attain his comfort, and then slowly convinced him to have his teeth cleaned, he switched on his favorite tv show on screen and kid is really really comfortable. Within minutes he completed his treatment. The treatment is just perfect and quick enough. I can strongly recommend this doctor. They maintained good hygiene for covid, which I am impressed by. ",

Doctor was very patient and answered all our questions before starting the treatment. He was very friendly and explained the kid in which she can understand easily.\n\nThe treatment is simple, it\u2019s an appliance that had to be worn for an hour or two in the daytime and throughout the night, nothing is fixed in the child\u2019s mouth like the regular braces. \nMy daughter has been on this treatment for one and half year and it works really well. I am really happy about the procedure and how it helped her in many ways like breathing, tongue position and the alignment of her teeth.\nMost people don\u2019t know about this treatment and end up with braces which is difficult for kids to manage.\nI would recommend Myobrace treatment and it easy on kids too.\nI am really happy that I went to Dr Kranthi Kumar for my daughter\u2019s treatment.",

In the first visit the doctor explained in detail about the process and at the same time making the  kid feel comfortable with him. We scheduled the appointment after 5 days as it was not practical to do it immediately.. Kids need time to get comfortable with the place and trust the doctor (Dr's words not mine ;)) .. Also used the gap to prepare my son about the process and we actually had role plays during play which really helped him on the D day. \r\n\r\nThe way the doctor handled the kid during the process is really commendable, explaining him what he is going to do and making my son also a part of the procedure,  at each step.  Child friendly.. ",

In our first visit Dr Kranthi sir explained clearly about my kids dental condition and treatment plan. She underwent RCT for 4 teeth and Extraction of damaged for 2 teeth. And also had a few cavity fillings. The doctor's interaction with my kid is very friendly and he makes my kid feel comfortable. We had 5 or 6 sittings for her treatment. The best thing is, she never cried or she never said no to any of our visits. I really thank Dr Kranthi Kumar for treating my kids dental issues. ",

Doctor examined her and told me the recommended treatment - baby root canal in one tooth, tooth extraction of a cavity, spoiled teeth, and fixing of a dental space maintainer. Naturally, I was really apprehensive of how things would go. But Dr. Kranti explained the process to me very nicely and eased my fear. Treatment (which was done in multiple sittings) went just perfect and quick. He ensured the process is both pain and stress free. They have a process of rewarding the kid after each treatment, which excites my daughter for the next visit.Then comes the post treatment care, which was my responsibility and I was stressing on that too. To my surprise, there was no down time. My daughter was doing perfectly normal even after the anesthesia wore off. His team also keeps tabs on how things are the next day. Thank you so much for a stress free experience.",

But let me make few things clear that we don\u2019t jump into treatments right in the first appointment especially for very young children or somebody coming to the dentist for the first time in their life time. This makes the child open up and become familiar with us and the surroundings which will help them in undergoing the treatments in a better way.\nRegarding the school timings, we treat almost 25-30 children in a day and it is literally impossible to accommodate everyone in the evening after 5 pm or in the weekends . So we try to accommodate older children above 6 (for whom we don\u2019t want them to miss their classes) after the school hours and for very young children we would like to schedule them in the mornings when they are fresh and energetic which makes them go through the treatments in comfortable way.\nHope you understand this and wish all the very best for your 4 year old.",
