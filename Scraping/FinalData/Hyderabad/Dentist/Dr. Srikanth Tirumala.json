From start to finish, everything about the procedure was exceptional.First and foremost, I was pleasantly surprised at how painless the surgery was. Doctor and his team took excellent care to ensure my comfort throughout the entire process. He explained every step of the procedure and made sure I was at ease, which significantly reduced my anxiety about the surgery.The actual extraction was completed in no time for me, and I experienced minimal discomfort during and after the surgery, which I attribute to his expertise.Furthermore, I found Dr. Srikanth to be incredibly easy-going and considerate. He patiently answered all my questions and addressed any concerns I had. His approachable and friendly demeanor put me at ease, and it was evident that they genuinely cared about my well-being before, during and even after surgery.Overall, I highly recommend Dr. Srikanth for anyone in need of oral surgery or dental care as the painless procedure, swift execution, and the doctor's easy-going and considerate nature made a significant difference in my overall comfort and satisfaction.",

But the doctor was very extremely experienced and immediately understood how to go about the surgery, he listened very patiently to all my concerns and since I was very anxious about the surgery,  he very patiently kept updating me about the process to ease my anxiety and fear.\n\nWould highly recommend Sris dental clinic to anyone. I went ahead with removal of my third molar and a root canal to one of my teeth, the entire process was completely painless and the doctor continued to support and check in on the progress post surgery via WhatsApp.",

The process took about a year and it was well worth the wait. Dr. Sri kept us informed every step of the way and made sure my son was comfortable. My son's teeth look amazing now and he is very happy with the final result. Dr. Sri truly exceeded my expectations and I am grateful for the beautiful smile he gave my son.

Now when I am not able to manage, after reference from a friend, i visited @Dr Sris dental. When I expressed fear of pain, Dr.Srikanth laughed and assured me there won't be any unbearable pain and also explained to me the procedure and treatment very well. I Went through the Root canal and wisdom tooth extraction. Wow to my surprise, no pain, except minor discomfort during the procedure, rest is just normal. He is very professional, very patient and clears all your doubts. His charges are also reasonable. Thanks Srikanth.",

I never feel rushed, He always asks if we have any other queries which I don't see in most of the clinics.\n\nHighly recommended to everyone...\n\nThe entire treatment process was very smooth and they were very accommodative of our requests with respect to scheduling the appointments. Also, they do not treat multiple patients at the same time, so the entire staff\u2019s focus will just be on you during any procedure. It gave a sense of belief that we made a right choice.\n\nI would give \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f for the amazing work they have done.",

He took time to walk me through the process and explain all the conditions of my teeth. He ensured that the crown was fit properly with followups on phone after the sessions completed.\n\nI would totally recommend him for anyone who want to take care of their teeth.",

From start to finish, everything about the procedure was exceptional.First and foremost, I was pleasantly surprised at how painless the surgery was. Doctor and his team took excellent care to ensure my comfort throughout the entire process. He explained every step of the procedure and made sure I was at ease, which significantly reduced my anxiety about the surgery.The actual extraction was completed in no time for me, and I experienced minimal discomfort during and after the surgery, which I attribute to his expertise.Furthermore, I found Dr. Srikanth to be incredibly easy-going and considerate. He patiently answered all my questions and addressed any concerns I had. His approachable and friendly demeanor put me at ease, and it was evident that they genuinely cared about my well-being before, during and even after surgery.Overall, I highly recommend Dr. Srikanth for anyone in need of oral surgery or dental care as the painless procedure, swift execution, and the doctor's easy-going and considerate nature made a significant difference in my overall comfort and satisfaction.",

I was very afraid as multiple dentist had advised me not to remove teeth due its proximity to the veins, the teeth was literally wrapped around the vein. But the doctor was very extremely experienced and immediately understood how to go about the surgery, he listened very patiently to all my concerns and since I was very anxious about the surgery,  he very patiently kept updating me about the process to ease my anxiety and fear.\n\nWould highly recommend Sris dental clinic to anyone. I went ahead with removal of my third molar and a root canal to one of my teeth, the entire process was completely painless and the doctor continued to support and check in on the progress post surgery via WhatsApp.",

The process took about a year and it was well worth the wait. Dr. Sri kept us informed every step of the way and made sure my son was comfortable. My son's teeth look amazing now and he is very happy with the final result. Dr. Sri truly exceeded my expectations and I am grateful for the beautiful smile he gave my son.

Now when I am not able to manage, after reference from a friend, i visited @Dr Sris dental. When I expressed fear of pain, Dr.Srikanth laughed and assured me there won't be any unbearable pain and also explained to me the procedure and treatment very well. I Went through the Root canal and wisdom tooth extraction. Wow to my surprise, no pain, except minor discomfort during the procedure, rest is just normal. He is very professional, very patient and clears all your doubts. His charges are also reasonable. Thanks Srikanth.",
