The reason for my visit was to take his opinion after being a victim of an improperly fitted bridge for my upper right premolar and canines.\n\nI had no problem with my teeth until I ...met with a car accident in 1997 when my right mandible was fractured. Also, I lost my upper two incisors. My mandible was tightened  for 4 weeks (during which I survived on liquid diet) and the fracture was healed. Later, my broken incisors were root canal treated and replaced with a new bridge. During all these years, I got a couple of replacement bridges after the previous ones were worn out.\n\nMeanwhile, my sinusitis problem was complicated, probably by these treatments and ended up in a tooth abscess of one of the neighboring canine tooth. This was diagnosed when I went to India (Chennai, my home town) for a visit. Although, they diagnosed the tooth abscess, the dentist I saw in Chennai did a sloppy job while taking the measurements for my new bridge, which I needed after extracting the abscessed tooth. As a result the bridge loosened day after day and came out completely by the time I returned back to Worcester UK. I was so fortunate that I could see Dr. Nikhil who identified and fixed the problem. Till today, I had no hint of any issues with the bridge. I am very thankful to Dr. Nikhil and her skillful approach to address my case. My sincere recommendation and reference to all is to go visit Dr. Nikhil, my favorite dentist, if have any dental problem.",

But the doc actually arrived at 8pm or later. (We had called to tell them they we did not want to wait so pls tell us when the doc would be there so we would come accordingly. We were told if you don't want to wait then 7:30 but he came at 8.) I thought the clinic could tell us proactively instead of wasting my time. And this was only because we called to say we didn't want to wait\nHe was also pretty cocky and refused to believe that my fillings were done in India at the year I mentioned they were. He kept telling me it is impossible and if I was sure and how this was never available and I must not know for sure.Well I got them done in one of the best places in Bombay and why would I lie I am not crazy. We only landed in this clinic because of the upvotes on practo (as we don't know too many ppl in Hyd for referrals) but perhaps practo is not reliable? \nThere were no other patients on a Saturday evening so I doubt he has a running practice at all for all those >1K 99% upvotes.\n\nPracto: Do you have some kind of check against fake reviews?\n\n",

I have got 4 root canals done in a single sitting in 2.5 hours, and never felt painful and uncomfortable. he is a specialist in dealing with root canals. He does the root canal treatment till the last minute with lot of passion and interest and patience without missing a single detail or single point in the treatment...at the same time understanding the pulse of the patient all through. I can name him as an \"Artist in dealing with Root Canal Treatments\". This is not prizing more or so...considering my past detailed experiences with all dentists...I am stating this. Very rare personality who has utmost passion in his profession. Appreciate It.Thanks a lot Nikhil Sir. ",

Instrument was sealed pack and it looks professional. After few general questions line my problem and detail about them docter examined me. \nSome equipment was also used to check the status of my tooth followed by an Digital x ray. After x ray docter showed me the picture and it was clearly visible to me about a hole in my tooth and bad tooth adjacent to it. \nThen i was given options of treatment that i can take to correct the problem but as u am a layman i asked the docter. And docter gave a clear prospective like money wise. Long term result wise and all. After a short discussion i chose the root canal treatments and implanting tooth option after removing the tooth. \n\nMy treatment was appointment the same day evening and i was made comfortable. And it got over in no time. I must add the all the staff was very good specially the chief Docter (Dr. Nikhil).  \n\nAt last i will say my generous thanks for the wonderful service that i was given like royalty. \n\nVista Dental station has become a one stop solution for near and dear once dental problem needs. \n\nDt.

The reason for my visit was to take his opinion after being a victim of an improperly fitted bridge for my upper right premolar and canines.\n\nI had no problem with my teeth until I ...met with a car accident in 1997 when my right mandible was fractured. Also, I lost my upper two incisors. My mandible was tightened  for 4 weeks (during which I survived on liquid diet) and the fracture was healed. Later, my broken incisors were root canal treated and replaced with a new bridge. During all these years, I got a couple of replacement bridges after the previous ones were worn out.\n\nMeanwhile, my sinusitis problem was complicated, probably by these treatments and ended up in a tooth abscess of one of the neighboring canine tooth. This was diagnosed when I went to India (Chennai, my home town) for a visit. Although, they diagnosed the tooth abscess, the dentist I saw in Chennai did a sloppy job while taking the measurements for my new bridge, which I needed after extracting the abscessed tooth. As a result the bridge loosened day after day and came out completely by the time I returned back to Worcester UK. I was so fortunate that I could see Dr. Nikhil who identified and fixed the problem. Till today, I had no hint of any issues with the bridge. I am very thankful to Dr. Nikhil and her skillful approach to address my case. My sincere recommendation and reference to all is to go visit Dr. Nikhil, my favorite dentist, if have any dental problem.",

Now that I re-read them I see they're probably written by the same person (perhaps the doctor himself, they all match his style of speaking or he has paid someone)\n\nOur appointment was at 6:30. But the doc actually arrived at 8pm or later. (We had called to tell them they we did not want to wait so pls tell us when the doc would be there so we would come accordingly. We were told if you don't want to wait then 7:30 but he came at 8.) I thought the clinic could tell us proactively instead of wasting my time. And this was only because we called to say we didn't want to wait\nHe was also pretty cocky and refused to believe that my fillings were done in India at the year I mentioned they were. He kept telling me it is impossible and if I was sure and how this was never available and I must not know for sure.Well I got them done in one of the best places in Bombay and why would I lie I am not crazy. We only landed in this clinic because of the upvotes on practo (as we don't know too many ppl in Hyd for referrals) but perhaps practo is not reliable? \nThere were no other patients on a Saturday evening so I doubt he has a running practice at all for all those >1K 99% upvotes.\n\nPracto: Do you have some kind of check against fake reviews?\n\n",

I was always scared to sit on a dentist chair. But sir made it very comfortable in understanding the problem and his words give you lot of confidence that all the treatment will be very comfortable and it is actually. I have got 4 root canals done in a single sitting in 2.5 hours, and never felt painful and uncomfortable. he is a specialist in dealing with root canals. He does the root canal treatment till the last minute with lot of passion and interest and patience without missing a single detail or single point in the treatment...at the same time understanding the pulse of the patient all through. I can name him as an \"Artist in dealing with Root Canal Treatments\". This is not prizing more or so...considering my past detailed experiences with all dentists...I am stating this. Very rare personality who has utmost passion in his profession. Appreciate It.Thanks a lot Nikhil Sir. ",

Nikhil. you're the man dr. Nik!\nAbout Front Desk: the front desk is wonderful. i would love to phrase a simile for them, and say they're like an agenda, but these people are so lovely that i find that expression rude.\nthis one person who assists dr. soto is not really part of the front desk, but rather everywhere because she is so experienced and intelligent. her name is prasana, and she is actually very welcoming . i am so happy i had the chance to meet her. it isn't every day that you get to meet people that are so lovely -and to top it off, the dentist's office' isn't scary anymore. i love going to vista dental studio for my appointments.\n\n \n",

He has other Hi-Tech equipment, as well, to achieve a precision results, which goes hand in hand with that perfect smile, that I now have.

After few general questions line my problem and detail about them docter examined me. \nSome equipment was also used to check the status of my tooth followed by an Digital x ray. After x ray docter showed me the picture and it was clearly visible to me about a hole in my tooth and bad tooth adjacent to it. \nThen i was given options of treatment that i can take to correct the problem but as u am a layman i asked the docter. And docter gave a clear prospective like money wise. Long term result wise and all. After a short discussion i chose the root canal treatments and implanting tooth option after removing the tooth. \n\nMy treatment was appointment the same day evening and i was made comfortable. And it got over in no time. I must add the all the staff was very good specially the chief Docter (Dr. Nikhil).  \n\nAt last i will say my generous thanks for the wonderful service that i was given like royalty. \n\nVista Dental station has become a one stop solution for near and dear once dental problem needs. \n\nDt.

I had a deep bite issue, had lost few molar teeth due to poor treatment and bad judgement from previous Dentists. He fixed the RCTs which weren\u2019t done properly by previous doctors resulting into reoccurring infections and pus. Also his molar implants which were done 3 years back are quite stable with no issue as I write this review. I have burnt tremendous amount of money, time and hope over the last 20 years with multiple dental issues but now it seems I am in good hands. \nKeep up the good work Dr Nikhil.",

Requirement of crown is decided only after the successful completion of  root canal treatment, until then it has to be closely observed Their are many cheap end products and techniQue available. And as the cost increase the quality increase too. along with that as you mentioned it was a difficult case to save. So obviousely we have to make sure it is done in the best way possible \n\nAny way it my most humble request to conform the cost prior the treatment to avoid unnecessary confusion as at our clinic, moto is to serve the best of our patients.",

I felt over charged for the crown, they have charged me 4,000 and I was not informed of it when RCT has happened, the cost was mentioned to me after RCT is done and measurement is taken and I don't have any other choice but take. My mom got RCT done and the crown was priced at Rs 1,000. Maybe there should have been sufficient explanation and the pricing should be transparent. It all round had cost me  9,000 for just one tooth RCT. Very expensive is what I felt and pricing needs to be relooked at, at least for the crowns. I would still recommend the doctor for the expertise he has shown in getting the RCT done for my tooth which has been damaged badly. \n\nThanks. ",

Prior to visiting I had emailed x-rays, quite frankly my mouth was a mess and Dr Nikhil had came back with a comprehensive treatment plan. Around 10 years ago I several mini implants fitted, since which time I have been beset with problems such as repeated infection, implant failure and detached bridge. Dr Nikhil was by far the simplest, most honest, open and person centred practitioner I had contacted. He inspired confidence and made me feel that something could be done to help, despite many dentists telling me they could not help. The treatment I received was first class. It was exactly as detailed in his treatment plans. There were no hidden costs and overall the cost was great value. So much cheaper than it is in the UK. The surgery was realitevly painless and conducted in hygienic surroundings. Vista Dental Studio is located in hitec city, a leafy Suburb of hyderabad. It is easily reached by local road transport. I am due to return in four weeks time for part two of my treatment plan and feel no trepidation whatsoever!! Dr Nikhil and his lovely family took me out for breakfast in a Local South Indian Dabha......well tasty and such a kind gesture. I would not hesitate to recommend treatment at Vista Dental Studio to anyone. The whole process was so much better than itvis in the UK......and that's not even taking into consideration the excellent value. Thanx Doc\"",

My dentist suggested that I called a gum specialist , but after a consultation he gave me the details of Smile Design. * ***** **** *** ******  ** *** **** *******  ** ********** ** ********* I have never had any pain at all. Unfortunately I had to have all my top teeth out and replaced. I had to have bone graft and what with Covid 19 it took a long time. Now I have my new teeth and I look and feel amazing. My thanks go to and his wonderful staff who had looked after me throughout.",

It was an annoyance, but not a big deal because most people don't look at your bottom teeth.\n\nHowever, I was starting to have some other problems, and found out that by straightening my teeth I could clean them more easily and prevent further problems down the road. I work long hours and have a very busy schedule, so the thought of braces just sounded too inconvenient, not to mention painful. Starting invisible ortho treatment  has allowed me to take care of my health while not interfering with my other responsibilities.",

The doctor supported and guided by phone and mail to take pain killers till I return to Hyderabad. After 15 days of my return I have consulted again.  My cap was removed and RCT was done again. I was advised to come after 3 days to recap the crown. It was unbearable for 3 days for me. I again went with severe pain and doctor reopened the temporary ceiling, cleaned up again and after 5 days refitted the crown. However still I am not feeling normal. It was advised by the doctors that there\u2019s an infection in my tooth and it will heel by it\u2019s own after some time.",

One Sunday night at around 2:00 AM I had this tooth pain on looking for doctors I came across Dr Nikhil I called him up and he promptly attended me at that time which was great at first place. And then I tooth the suggested treatment which relived my pain and trouble.  I was charged reasonably as I picked the best of the line treatment options. Staff friendliness and warm welcoming nature is worth appreciation. Over all experience was good altogether. \n\nAlso I came to know that most of my friends and office colleagues also took treatment from the same docter and all share the good experience as I did. So all well hear and good recommend place for dental treatments. ",

Their by on humanitarian grounds I did help you which I did not charge. So bottom line is if you say I am costly then firstly confirm the cost of treatment then go ahead.

Where as you have mentioned Rs. 1000 which is a false allegation.  \n\nSo i suggest you to acknowledge the work done at the cost i charged you which is rock bottom low.

I find his style of practice is needed more then the corporate setup as I an not been forced or sold a treatment. Instead I am free and comfortable to meet docter for the problems and treatments. \n\nI am happy to be hear under doctor nikhil's care and super vision. \n\nAfter me my wife also took the treatment and we both endouse his services for a good dental treatment. \n\nI found clinic staff was also supportive and trained well and well behaved.\n\nEquipment and other medical devices are also well maintaned..\n\nSo from me both thumbs up for Dr nikhil saran, his team, and for vista dental studio.
