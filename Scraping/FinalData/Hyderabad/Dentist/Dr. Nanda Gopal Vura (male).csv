,,0,0,YES,I was extremely scared to show my half erupted wisdom tooth which had decay but Dr Nanda gopal garu was very friendly and patient with me and my queries. He explained the procedure in advance so I had a mental picture of what would happen . During the day of surgery I was a bit calm as I trusted the doctors words. I got all four of my wisdom tooth out within 45 mins time and i didnâ€™t experience any pain. Also doctors assistant Rajanikanth was helpful and polite. You can visit Dr. Nanda Gopal without any fear. I also like to thank Dr. Nanda Gopal for taking good care of me. ,2021-08-16 12:13:36,False,True,Bindhya,,,
,,0,0,YES,"I had my wisdom teeth extracted by Dr Nanda Gopal and must say he did a fab job. He took time to explain the whole process initially itself which calmed me down. The extraction process was also very smooth and painless. 

He clearly explained what post extraction care to be taken etc. On the whole a very skilled doctor that I would recommend for dental issues. ",2022-07-22 05:42:48,False,True,Vinutha,,,
