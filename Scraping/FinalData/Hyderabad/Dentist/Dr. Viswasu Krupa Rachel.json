Dr.Rachel has done an excellent job on my teeth which my regular or should I say my previous dentist was not able to. \nShe diagnosed my problem very accurately and gave me treatment which was painless and explained me well about the whole procedure. Dr. Rachel is very good at her work. I am going to recommend her to people I know. Keep up the good work my friend. Cheers.",
