"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Dental Implant Fixing,",0,0,YES,"I visited The Dental Specialists for Implants, Dr. Venkat did my treatment, 
I am very happy with the treatment and procedure done by Dr. Venkat. He is very patient friendly. I visited other clinics for the same but was told to wait 3-6 months. Dr. Venkat immediately checked me and did my implants in his own TTPHIL technique. Most important thing was I was having almost zero pain after the procedure. 

Would recommend Dr. Venkat and whole Team.
