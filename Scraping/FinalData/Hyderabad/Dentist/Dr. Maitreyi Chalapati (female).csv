,,0,0,YES,"I consulted Dr. Maithreyii for my 6 year old daughter's treatment for pulpectomy. Doctor had done the treatment with support of child specialist for one of the 3 sittings.

Very satisfied with doctor's patience and entire experience.
Clinic is very hygienically and neatly maintained.
Strongly refer this doctor.",2024-01-19 05:14:53,False,True,Pranita,,,
