I have good teeth except one teeth required something like root canal and cap fitting over them. Rootcanal dr. Saranya is very polite & explaning every step during the procedure & cap doctor dr. Veena is nice.It was done within a week time without any trouble. I am perfect now with all my 32 teeth intact. His clinic is very big and have everything that needs for dental care and treatments. From reception to the treatment everything was good. I wish Dr.sunehra all the staff good luck. Thank you doctor & the staff. I'll definitely suggest this clinic to all my friends & family membe.",
