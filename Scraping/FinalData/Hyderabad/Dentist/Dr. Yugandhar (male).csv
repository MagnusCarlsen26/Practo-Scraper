But no where, except here, I have seen an X ray given on a paper but not on a film. Even the paper on which doctor has written his suggestions and the cost of the treatment had been taken by the reception staff and did not allow to take it with me and the reason they sited was patients are loosing the files and that's why they aren't giving it to them. To some degree it' could be a valid reason but there are plenty of options. Right ? They have everything online so nothing will happen even if a patient lost the entire file.
