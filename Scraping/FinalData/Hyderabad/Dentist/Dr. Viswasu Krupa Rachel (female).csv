,,0,0,YES,"
A casual visit to a dentist  turned into taking her services, which I found to be very high quality. Dr.Rachel has done an excellent job on my teeth which my regular or should I say my previous dentist was not able to. 
She diagnosed my problem very accurately and gave me treatment which was painless and explained me well about the whole procedure. Dr. Rachel is very good at her work. I am going to recommend her to people I know. Keep up the good work my friend. Cheers.",2023-09-09 19:12:26,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
