"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Straightening Teeth (Invisalign) ,",0,0,YES,"I am writing to share my experience about the Invisalign treatment I received from Dr. Srinivas. I must say that I am extremely satisfied with the treatment and the overall experience.

From the very first consultation, he took the time to explain the entire treatment process in detail, answered all my questions patiently and made sure I was comfortable with everything. He also discussed the expected outcomes and provided me with a clear idea of what to expect throughout the treatment.

 I could see a visible improvement in the alignment of my teeth within a few weeks. He monitored my progress regularly and made adjustments to the treatment plan as required to ensure that I achieved the desired results.

Thank you, Dr. Srinivas, for the excellent care and service.",2023-04-23 16:22:44,False,True,Sravya,,,
