Dr.Swetha having lot of experience and treatment went very smooth and painless and gave options about crown and what are all available options and its benefits. I opted for Zirconia as that have offer of 20% off. And all the treatment cost is at very reasonable price. So I opted for going overall cleaning as well as LASER cleaning of tooth and composite fillings of 2 tooth where small cavities are formed. I recommend Dr.Swetha and Dr. Obul reddy as best dentist in kondapur sriram nagar.\nSo choose wisely your dentist.

The doctor is very caring and patient friendly and explained me all the problems in detail and suggested me correct solution. I have 5 cavities which are deep as Dr. Swetha herself a root canal specialist had done the treatment without any pain and entire procedure was smooth.

Now I can understand the value as no changes were seen and And in mid of the treatment i again consulted Dr.Swetha and she suggested me Invisalign and it\u2019s been 3 months I can see the results. Not only is\neveryone a thorough professional here, but they take out so much time to explain each and every\nprocedure- the before after and during that you are completely at ease. Excellent post procedure follow up as well. Highly recommend!",

I felt very comfortable the moment I met Dr.Swetha and Dr.Obul Reddy as they examined my teeth and explained me what's wrong\nand the complete course of treatment which includes implants root canals and bone grafting. I was very impressed the way the whole staff treated me and my problem got fixed in 3 sessions over a period of about a week.
