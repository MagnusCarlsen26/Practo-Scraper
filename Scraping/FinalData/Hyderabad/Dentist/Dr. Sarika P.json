Although  my daughter is a bit cranky towards doctors, they both did the primary investigations pretty well and with care. The cavities in the top front four teeths were very deeps and had reached the pulp. They suggested to go for pulp therapy under general anesthesia, as my daughter is very small and is very afraid of the dental instruments. I went ahead with their suggestion, and had the treatment done  in the Nice Hospitals at Masab Tank. The complete procedure went pretty well, and my daughter is liking her new teeth now. *** ******* *** ****** ************* *** cleared all the doubts that I had about the treatment.",

Staff are well trained, courteous and helpful. Prices are nominal and all charges are explained in a transparent fashion. As such the doctors have a noncommercial mindset with the prime focus on the well being of the patient and on providing quality service. On the whole, we are fortunate to have found  this clinic and are highly satisfied with everything (treatment, price, quality etc.). To be specific, our daughter's treatment is progressing well and the results obtained so far is astonishing under the able and skillful guidance of Dr. Sarika. I highly recommend this clinic to anyone who is looking for dental service.",

I have read about Dr. Sarika on net and have approached her. She checked the oral condition of my daughter completely and told us that pulpectomy has to be done. She patiently explained us the steps in it and then started with the treatment. She was very kind patient child friendly. My daughter didn't have any pain during the entire treatment. Frankly speaking I should say Dr. Sarika is one of the best pedodontist in fact the best pedodontist I can say. She knows very well how to handle kids. Thank you so much Dr. Sarika. I would recommend Dr. Sarika to everyone without a second thought.",

Although  my daughter is a bit cranky towards doctors, they both did the primary investigations pretty well and with care. The cavities in the top front four teeths were very deeps and had reached the pulp. They suggested to go for pulp therapy under general anesthesia, as my daughter is very small and is very afraid of the dental instruments. I went ahead with their suggestion, and had the treatment done  in the Nice Hospitals at Masab Tank. The complete procedure went pretty well, and my daughter is liking her new teeth now. *** ******* *** ****** ************* *** cleared all the doubts that I had about the treatment.",

Our first impression when we stepped into the clinic was that it was clean, neat and organized. The doctors here are highly skilled, proffesional and world class. Staff are well trained, courteous and helpful. Prices are nominal and all charges are explained in a transparent fashion. As such the doctors have a noncommercial mindset with the prime focus on the well being of the patient and on providing quality service. On the whole, we are fortunate to have found  this clinic and are highly satisfied with everything (treatment, price, quality etc.). To be specific, our daughter's treatment is progressing well and the results obtained so far is astonishing under the able and skillful guidance of Dr. Sarika. I highly recommend this clinic to anyone who is looking for dental service.",

Initially Dr. Ayesha investigated and elaborated the underlying issue to me through digital X-rays and specified number of sittings needed for the treatment. Later,Dr. Chaitrika did RCT (laser) followed by crown placing by Dr.Apoorva. Both the Doctors are very professional & did thier job meticulously and answered all my queires patiently. During entire treatment, I have not taken single medicine/pain-killer which obviously signifies how flawless the treatment was. Moreover,the Hospital ambience is so pleasant to wait till my turn comes and the front desk staff are very cordial. The most appreciable thing is that they have fixed appointments (of four sittings) as per my schedule (as I need to come from Khammam for every sitting). Greetings to Dr. Sarika who is managing and maintaining the Clinic exceptionally well.",

It made no difference to her condition. We checked on Google for the best pedodontists in India and that's how we came across Dr. Sarika and THE DENTAL SPECIALISTS!\nThey are an amazing dental clinic. The treatment went on for 4 days and it was all treated like a dream! After so many days we saw our daughter laugh and play!\nI am very thankful to Dr Sarika for her friendly approach towards my child who she befriended and treated!\n\nI WILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND DR.

But I realized quality of treatment is what matters. I am very satisfied with the treatment she offered. She treats kids very politely.\nWhat I absolutely liked about her is that she treated my daughter like her daughter and treated. The constant follow up calls next day ensuring your child's condition is very appreciating.\nYou never see such commitment that anywhere.\nI recommend Dr. Sarika and THE DENTAL SPECIALISTS to my friends and family.",
