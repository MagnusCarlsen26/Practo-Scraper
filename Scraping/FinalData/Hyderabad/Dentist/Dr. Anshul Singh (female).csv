"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,"I was extremely paranoid about my visit to the dentist for my root canal. It was amazing to see how well both the doctors calmed me down and patiently worked with me and my paranoia ...

The orthodontist assigned for me was brilliant! He was gentle and very systematic and organized. The medical procedure was explained well and post treatment care as well as the next steps in the procedure was explained in detail by the doctor. 

The doctors in this clinic have good connections with various specialists as well. I must say after this, my faith in dentists has been restored. Thank you very much.
