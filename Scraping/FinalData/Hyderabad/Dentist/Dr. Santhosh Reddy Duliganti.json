I was clearly explained the reason for this, shown xrays and options for treatment. I was shown the various treatment they could do, listed the pros and cons of each type of treatment and what would happen if I chose one treatment over the other. \n\nDr. Reddy and guided me through these options and recommended that I get root canal treatment for two teeth and a minor filling for another tooth.\n\nIt took me a few sittings since I had three teeth to get fixed but he and his RCT expert made it convenient considering my schedule and did a completely painless root canal treatment.\n\nThroughout the process they gave me instructions on what to expect during the treatment, how to take care of the affected teeth and managed the entire treatment without any pain at all.\n\nI must reiterate that the entire process was completely painless.\n\nThey also provided me options for the caps and discussed with me the pros and cons of each type of cap. The whole process was completely around my schedule, the doctor is available on whatsapp to discuss treatment during the entire process too.\n\nI felt that the prices were entirely reasonable too.\n\nI rate this doctor 10/10.",

I was shown the various treatment they could do, listed the pros and cons of each type of treatment and what would happen if I chose one treatment over the other. \n\nDr. Reddy and guided me through these options and recommended that I get root canal treatment for two teeth and a minor filling for another tooth.\n\nIt took me a few sittings since I had three teeth to get fixed but he and his RCT expert made it convenient considering my schedule and did a completely painless root canal treatment.\n\nThroughout the process they gave me instructions on what to expect during the treatment, how to take care of the affected teeth and managed the entire treatment without any pain at all.\n\nI must reiterate that the entire process was completely painless.\n\nThey also provided me options for the caps and discussed with me the pros and cons of each type of cap. The whole process was completely around my schedule, the doctor is available on whatsapp to discuss treatment during the entire process too.\n\nI felt that the prices were entirely reasonable too.\n\nI rate this doctor 10/10.",
