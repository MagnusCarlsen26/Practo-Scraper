On the second visit through the blood test we got the news.\n\nThe 3rd month of pregnancy I felt lower back pain. We visited the Madam on the same day. The first question from madam was did you had any bleeding? It was just a light spot(a drop) thought it is common, but the madam strictly told us to take a complete bed rest, as this would have risk of abortion.\n\nIn the 4th month of pregnancy, there was bleeding at 4 AM. We called madam and she immediately asked us to come to the hospital. We reached the hospital at 4:30AM and got admitted. The FHR was 149 and BP was normal. Medication was provided to control the bleeding and FHR was checked every 4 hours. Madam was continuously checking the reports and getting updates from a duty doctor. The bleeding was controlled in 2 hours and we were in hospital for 2 days for observation. We got discharged from hospital but the fear was still there inside us.\n\nAgain after 15 days, we had bleeding at 12:30AM. We called madam and she immediately asked us to come to the hospital. The procedure was the same as to control the bleeding and check the FHR every 4 hours.\n\nWe faced the bleeding again two times and were completely heartbroken but the courage provided by madam helped us to fight. We have strictly followed the procedure provided by Madam i.e. complete bed rest, plenty of fluid, a good amount of water daily and 2 tablets a day.\n\n6th month onwards, there was no bleeding and things were going well. We were following madam's instructions strictly.\n\nOn the 9th month, at 1:30 AM, water broke. We contacted the doctor and rushed to hospital immediately. We reached hospital at 2 AM. Madam has checked the condition and shifted us to OT. At 6:07 AM we were blessed with a baby boy of 4 kg wt by normal delivery.\n\nI am very lucky to have connected with Dr. Anuradha and highly recommend you to approach madam for any issues related to infertility. We are very happy with the way she takes care of each and every aspect and provides appropriate suggestions with minimal medication. She also responds to calls and whatsapp messages (24x7) also has a lot of patience to listen to our problems and will explain things clearly.\n\nThank you very much!",

I totally agree with you that a patient's life is more important than my appointment and I don't expect to leave an emergency case in mid and attend to me but please be informed that for working professionals time is something that cannot be compromised. and thats the reason i made an appointment online on practo and im not blaming you or saying your treatment was wrong . Its just that you were late by 40 mins and that time is something no one expects when a prior appointment was made and i could be informed atleast by your staff that it is going to take some time. This is all i expected. and regarding the previous feedback its the one made prior to your revert . in that time span of 40 mins .. Not after the consultation.\n ",

On the second visit through the blood test we got the news.\n\nThe 3rd month of pregnancy I felt lower back pain. We visited the Madam on the same day. The first question from madam was did you had any bleeding? It was just a light spot(a drop) thought it is common, but the madam strictly told us to take a complete bed rest, as this would have risk of abortion.\n\nIn the 4th month of pregnancy, there was bleeding at 4 AM. We called madam and she immediately asked us to come to the hospital. We reached the hospital at 4:30AM and got admitted. The FHR was 149 and BP was normal. Medication was provided to control the bleeding and FHR was checked every 4 hours. Madam was continuously checking the reports and getting updates from a duty doctor. The bleeding was controlled in 2 hours and we were in hospital for 2 days for observation. We got discharged from hospital but the fear was still there inside us.\n\nAgain after 15 days, we had bleeding at 12:30AM. We called madam and she immediately asked us to come to the hospital. The procedure was the same as to control the bleeding and check the FHR every 4 hours.\n\nWe faced the bleeding again two times and were completely heartbroken but the courage provided by madam helped us to fight. We have strictly followed the procedure provided by Madam i.e. complete bed rest, plenty of fluid, a good amount of water daily and 2 tablets a day.\n\n6th month onwards, there was no bleeding and things were going well. We were following madam's instructions strictly.\n\nOn the 9th month, at 1:30 AM, water broke. We contacted the doctor and rushed to hospital immediately. We reached hospital at 2 AM. Madam has checked the condition and shifted us to OT. At 6:07 AM we were blessed with a baby boy of 4 kg wt by normal delivery.\n\nI am very lucky to have connected with Dr. Anuradha and highly recommend you to approach madam for any issues related to infertility. We are very happy with the way she takes care of each and every aspect and provides appropriate suggestions with minimal medication. She also responds to calls and whatsapp messages (24x7) also has a lot of patience to listen to our problems and will explain things clearly.\n\nThank you very much!",

I totally agree with you that a patient's life is more important than my appointment and I don't expect to leave an emergency case in mid and attend to me but please be informed that for working professionals time is something that cannot be compromised. and thats the reason i made an appointment online on practo and im not blaming you or saying your treatment was wrong . Its just that you were late by 40 mins and that time is something no one expects when a prior appointment was made and i could be informed atleast by your staff that it is going to take some time. This is all i expected. and regarding the previous feedback its the one made prior to your revert . in that time span of 40 mins .. Not after the consultation.\n ",
