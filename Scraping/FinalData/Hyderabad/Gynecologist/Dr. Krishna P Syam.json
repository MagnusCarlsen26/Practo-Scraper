She was personally in touch with me on phone and suggested medication accordingly. I had heavy vaginal bleeding in my 35th week of gestation. She arranged everything and asked me to admit in the care hospital (as she is working in care and due to the pregnancy complications i had) and delivered the baby via emergency c section. I strongly recommend her for consultation.",

She was more than a doctor to me throughout my pregnancy journey and gave me the best suggestions whenever it was needed the most for me.  I never thought that I can recover from a C section so quickly and I wholeheartedly give that credit to the doctor for that. I can't thank her enough for being such a caring doctor and wonderful human being. After my surgery she has become favourite doctor to my mom and in law as well :) \n",

She was more than a doctor to me throughout my pregnancy journey and gave me the best suggestions whenever it was needed the most for me.  I never thought that I can recover from a C section so quickly and I wholeheartedly give that credit to the doctor for that. I can't thank her enough for being such a caring doctor and wonderful human being. After my surgery she has become favourite doctor to my mom and in law as well :) \n",

She  enquired about all my physical conditions and other symptoms in detail and gave good advices. As it is my 1st pregnancy I was little bit scared, but after the 1st consultation itself I feel very free.. \nI really like her friendly approach to patients and it is really important for any patient. \nI will recommend Dr. Krishna Ma'am to those who are close to me. Because my experience with her was absolutely great and I am really happy with her treatment. ",
