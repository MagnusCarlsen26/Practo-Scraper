"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Well, Dr Mandira Singh is a Doctor of few but the exact right words and guidance, she is a person of action rather than words. We have been consulting her for a couple of months now and being treated with great care and guidance. We were terrified with an unexpected pain followed by passing of fleshy clot that occurred recently after which we requested for an emergency consult, though she was not present, she guided us through another doctor to get the required diagnosis done and later walked us through the rest of the treatment with the assurance needed.
