But she behaved so rudley, she didn't bother about my pain and agony . She didn't let us leave and forced us to remove the canula before leaving. I was in sooo much pain yet she stood in the way and dint let us leave and we left after removal of canula .I was taken to another hospital *** ****** *** ***** * *** ** ******* ******* *** ******* ********** We were in the hospital for just half an hour *** *************  ****** *** ******* ** *** ******** That was the most disappointing  and painful experience . Then on I decided never to visit Alpha hospital ,never to visit Mrs. Siraj  and would never recommend  anyone\n",
