She owns the hospital and is considered to be one of the best infertility treatment specialists in Hyderabad.\n\nShe carefully listened to all our problems, including how we went through an infertility treatment before and did not find any success with it. Dr. Roya Rozati was supportive and caring and she asked her to go through her treatment. She assured us of getting successful results.\n\nWe were a bit hesitant at first but then we listened to her. After almost 1 year, I am a mother of a 3 month old baby. **** *** ********* *** ****** *********** *********** Dr. Roya Rozati was able to help me conceive. I am not only grateful to her but also her entire team of doctors, nurse, medical staffs and lab technicians were excellent at their job.\n\nI will suggest every couple who had an unsuccessful infertility treatment or wants to treat their infertility should get in touch with Dr. Roya Rozati as she will provide them the **** treatment and assist them in achieving a successful pregnancy.",

Very bad behavior and here comes the staff they won't understand the perception written by doctor and the main point is they will charge 700/- per each visit even if you visit today and again came tomorrow to get some clarity on perception then again charge 700/-. Overall if I have rating system in negative then I will give -5 to this doctor. Please be cautious about this doctor and another thing I want to mention here was they won't provide bills for the amount what ever we are paying so that you won't have chance to remembrance your amount.

It was exceptionally pleasant that we had not to hold up even a single minute late of our appointment time. Since she has a great deal of years of experience, clearly, the surgery was effective and post surgery safety measures were at that point taken. Today my mom is healthy at all. I would suggest everyone that first please take note of experience of the doctor because this is the thing that brings life nothing else.\n",

Dr. Roya Rozati was supportive and caring and she asked her to go through her treatment. She assured us of getting successful results.\n\nWe were a bit hesitant at first but then we listened to her.

Very bad behavior and here comes the staff they won't understand the perception written by doctor and the main point is they will charge 700/- per each visit even if you visit today and again came tomorrow to get some clarity on perception then again charge 700/-. Overall if I have rating system in negative then I will give -5 to this doctor. Please be cautious about this doctor and another thing I want to mention here was they won't provide bills for the amount what ever we are paying so that you won't have chance to remembrance your amount.

I chose to keep confidence in specialist named Dr Roya Rozati, as recommended by one of my dear friend whose spouse was patient of Dr. Roya. Immediately I and reached with my Mom. It was exceptionally pleasant that we had not to hold up even a single minute late of our appointment time. Since she has a great deal of years of experience, clearly, the surgery was effective and post surgery safety measures were at that point taken. Today my mom is healthy at all. I would suggest everyone that first please take note of experience of the doctor because this is the thing that brings life nothing else.\n",
