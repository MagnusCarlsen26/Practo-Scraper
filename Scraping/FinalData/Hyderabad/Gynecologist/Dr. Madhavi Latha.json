She not only listens to the patients fully, but also gives high attention to the each and every detail of the problems. She interacts with patients thoroughly to understands and diagnose the problem. She always prefers to prescribe the generic medicines (low cost medicines) and avoids highly priced brands. She explains about each and every medication on the prescription and its dosage. She calls for next visits only if it is required. I definitely recommend this doctor. Finally, she definitely gives some time for the patients to speak and counsel them if required. She is always available via clinic and hospital. I referred this doctor to many of my colleagues. ",

She always prefers to prescribe the generic medicines (low cost medicines) and avoids highly priced brands. She explains about each and every medication on the prescription and its dosage. She calls for next visits only if it is required. I definitely recommend this doctor. Finally, she definitely gives some time for the patients to speak and counsel them if required.

I've consulted her throughtout my pregnancy and she was so kind enough to answer all my points. She explains every tablet she prescribes and also a very good thing is, she mostly goes with medicines from standard companies rather than going with local brands. I had couple of emergencies in my pregnancy and she attended me in no time. She did my delivery as well and that was a pretty smooth and easy experience. Overall, we had a great experience and can confidently say that you are in safe hands if with Dr. Madhavilatha. \n",
