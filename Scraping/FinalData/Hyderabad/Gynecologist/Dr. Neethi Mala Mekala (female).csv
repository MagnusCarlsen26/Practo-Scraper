,,0,0,NO,"My 1st visit to Medicover hospital is not best. I took my wife for checkup and we got appointment with Dr. Mala. Here notes which was captured is incorrect. The date was captured incorrectly and we asked to correct it.

She asked to go for few tests and when ever we want to show the results her room will be locked from inside. I understand if she was treating patients but no that’s not the case. 

Sisters themselves used to call her on mobile and then she used to open the door. I also understand it’s not lunch time. Not pretty sure what’s need for a doctor alone in room to get locked from inside when she knows patients were waiting for her.

Finally she looked at the reports and did not conclude anything and asked to re-visit after 10days.


Coming to hospital , for UCT test result we waited for 1.5hrs. Lab assistants were also not up to the mark as the sample we given was at same place and report was generated. Not sure if the test was really done or not.

Anyway thanks for Medicover for the services and make sure your staff and teams are focused on patients at least when they were at hospital.",2023-03-25 03:43:05,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
