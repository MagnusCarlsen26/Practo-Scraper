"Doctor friendliness,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Hyderabad hospitals environment and working culture is new to me. I don’t  know why they insist/mandate Aadhar details for general consultation and regular checkups.  This clinic located in Banjara Hills, has to improve their ambiance to crate a positive environment. 

The only positive point is the Dr approach to understand, hear and analyse the issue and will suggest only the required tests. 


The staff should learn to consolidate all should have one single billing.  I made 3 payments in one consultant. 

Do not agree for blood tests in this clinic. They are outsourcing the tests and will not share the reports, even on request to share online they are reluctant.",2024-03-26 08:23:02,False,True,Sandeep Sharma P,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"This is our genuine and heartfelt review on Dr Hari Chandana Madam and Happy to share the news that after so many years we are gonna be parents all because of excellent treatment by Dr Hari Chandana Madam. We visited multiple fertility centres for five years before coming to Nova but all in vain as almost all the fertility centres intimidated us in the name of age factor and directly suggested to go for IVF treatment and as a last attempt we visited Dr Chandana and she is the first doctor who suggested to go for IUI instead of IVF and we are happy to share that in the first attempt of IUI the result came out positive and my wife is pregnant now. Though pregnancy is a long journey getting the ***** treatment from the right doctor is very important as well and Dr Chandana came to our rescue when we were really stressed out due to infertility.

Dr Chandana is an excellent doctor and she made us comfortable with detailed explanation about the treatment. Dr Chandana treats her patients with empathy as most of the couples are in a state of depression because of infertility and I strongly believe if you come across the right doctor you can overcome infertility and Dr Chandana rightly fits the bill in terms of a perfect doctor.

Dr Chandana patiently listens to her patients concerns and will always help in clearing her patients doubts. We are extremely happy with her treatment and she is really a ray of hope for wannabe moms. I suggest everyone who is suffering with infertility problem to visit Dr Hari Chandana Madam and just blindly believe in her treatment, positive results will follow.",2020-11-15 15:13:17,False,True,Gouthami,,,

Only if we had met her in more early years . She was so polite . Explained everything n her voice had so much hope . We had already been to fertility centers in the US, but all were trying to find the problem instead of solving, so we came to india found her name to be pretty known and took a leap of faith . When my first cycle failed and i was left no hope and  two embryos, she carefully chose a treatment plan that wont lead to a future failure  n that choice came to be true . All thanks to god for helping us find her. . Im pregnant now 5 weeks , for the first time in 7 yrs . She is the true definition of a doctor. Listens to her patients , hears all their concerns , answers all their doubts and is Worried abt the patient’s condition more than anything else . Her only focus is solving the patients problem. I would recommend her for everyone out there , trying fr a chance at parenthood . She is the one . ",2021-05-05 07:50:12,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
