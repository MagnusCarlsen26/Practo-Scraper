We came to cradle for a 10 AM appointment and were made to sit for 2 hours. Despite our multiple requests we were told she is busy busy busy (of course with OP patients). When we arrived, we are the only ones there, but took 2 hours to get into scanning room, which is a circus alley in my opinion. The phones kept ringing all the time during scan and nurses keep on coming and going for advises and a fellow doctor comes inside and talks about another patient with this doctor. Is it a scanning room or consultation room?\nI have been to another hospital nearby and had to come here due to unavailability of slots there. That hospital staff are really helpful and the doctor in scanning room is very strict on mobile usage and sounds. She explained everything in detail but here no explanation at all.\nThe nurses and staff carry a peculiar attitude. My humble request is, we come to you in search of a good doctor about our health and wellness, if this is the way you treat us, I have nothing to say anymore. Please think.",

I delivered baby during Covid-19 pandemic situation and was little afraid. Me and my husband were alone and due to Covid-19, no one from our family was able to come. Doctor has been very supportive in this situation and tried to calm me down always if I was in tention. She does not scare much and told us how to take care of myself and baby during pregnancy. She does not explain things in too much details and try to keep things point to point, does not scare much, which we liked. She answers our questions and doubts pretty well. I have the habit of reading and getting all the info, so was not depending on doctor for everything. But if some people want to completely depend on doctor, then they should ask themself with doctor their doubts. If we ask anything, she eill explain nicely.. She always used to repond on whatsapp if I ask any question which was very much needed in this pandamic situation. Many times i was able to resolve my queries on whatsapp which avoided going to hospital on this Covid situation. Even now after my delivery, if i ask her anything on whatsapp she still helps me.Overall i can say i am happy with doctor the way she has helped me during my pregnency journey.",

Now, after the tests it turns out that my AMH level was dangerously low which indicates low fertility and requires treatment like IVF for conceiving. But to my utter shock the doctor paid no heed to it and did not even bother to explain my medical condition.\n\nIronically, for the next 6 months, she had actually put me on various contraceptive pills and some ayurvedic tonic to regularize my periods ****** *** ***** ********* ********* ** ********** ******* *** **** *** ** ********** ** ********* ********* ***** **** ***** ******** *** ***** ********* ********* *** I was not comfortable changing the doctor while I was already under medication (contraceptive pills as prescribed by her) for regularizing my periods. \n\nFinally, when the prescribed course of contraceptives was over I switched to another doctor (she's a renowned doctor from a reputed hospital of Hyderabad) and in the first trans vaginal scan itself  they detected an abnormality in the shape of my uterus, which is from my birth. ** ** ***** ******** *** ***** ****** ***** *** ****** *** ****  **** ***** ** * ************* ****** FYI, each trans-vaginal scan in cradle costs Rs. 1500/- and this hospital where I am currently going charges only Rs.450/- .
