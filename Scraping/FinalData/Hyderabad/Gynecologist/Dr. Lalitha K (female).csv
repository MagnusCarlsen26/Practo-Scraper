"Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Urinary Tract Infection (UTI),",0,0,NO,"Appointment slots open were 11:15 and 11:45 AM
We chose 11:45 and have been at the clinic on time but had to wait till 12:45 for the doc to arrive.. no respect for time..

During wait time after doctor was in staff asked us to hold our 18month in the lobby and not let him make any noise.. it does not make sense if anyone expects a toddle to keep his mouth shut.. during appointment you should specify that toddlers are not allowed insted.* ***** ***** ****** **** *** ******** ** ******** *** ******** *** ** *** ***** **********
Consultation fee was 1000 which is fart high *** * ****** ******** ** * ***** ********* ******** *** ****** **** **** ******
Finally doc called us in and didn’t even speak much directly wrote a cystoscope test ans asked to meet nurse.

Nurs madam is busier that the doc who made us wait for 10 more min and came and just said price is 15000/- come prepared.

Haven’t heard 15000/- being charged for a cystoscope in a clinic.. my son had to undergoe a cystoscope ** ******* ***** ****** ** ****** *** ********* ** *** ******* *** *** **** *** *****
