person to properly diagnose and performed a successful ectopic surgery in 2022, showcasing not only her expertise but also a genuine concern for my well-being. 
She thoroughly  explained the case to us and made sure that we understand the cruciality of the situation and the procedure was carried out with precision, 
and I felt reassured at every step.

She always goes above and beyond to address my concerns and keep me informed.Her approachability made each visit comfortable, fostering a sense of trust and collaboration.

C-Section Surgery:

Finally comes the Surgery,as we approached the delivery date, the discussion around a C-section was handled with care and transparency.
Dr.Chandana Mam's patience and accessibility made the decision-making process easier, and the actual surgery was conducted with utmost professionalism and care
considering my previous history and as my case is under High-Risk, Dr.Chandana Mam's approach to diagnosis and treatment was nothing short of top-notch and her
ability to navigate and manage high-risk situations with skill and precision was evident throughout the entire process,
providing me with a sense of confidence and security.

She was always available and there for us, regardless of her busy schedule, and she is very patient in listening to all of our concerns and questions. She treats her patients like family and goes above and beyond to assist them.

 I successfully conceived without any medication or any treatment  and had a happy pregnancy until 7th month but then unfortunately went into labour at 31 weeks for unknown reasons ( had my baby#1 till full term) and was also hit by Covid at the same time, leaving me unsure what to do, but Dr. Chandana, despite her health condition, reassured me and arrived at the hospital within minutes, standing by my side throughout my delivery and ensuring I was all in good health until the baby was delivered. She also assisted us in having the baby via VBAC, which I had never imagined or dreamed of. She was always a phone call away from the start, until I recovered from my pregnancy, and even now!
