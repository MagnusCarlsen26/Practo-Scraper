                "review_text": "I wanted my wife to see a Gynic during our vacations in India. She went through a few tests beforehand and wanted an experts advise. Due to time constraints, I had to choose a Gynaecologist within close proximity to our home. Practo has become a handy tool for patients who are deciding whether a doctor/clinic may be the right fit. That\u2019s how I found Zoi.\n \nFront office: I called the front office and booked an appointment with Gynic before our visit. We visited the hospital and I\u2019m astounded as the outlook was way beyond my expectations. Front office staff were friendly; they apologized that the doctor we have been told is not available due to uncertain reasons and have been redirected to Dr. Nikitha Reddy K. We were fine as we weren\u2019t too fussy to choose the doctor since it was just a general catch up to interpret the reports.\n \nThe Doctor: I found Dr. Nikitha Reddy to be calm and competent. Since the issue wasn\u2019t so serious she prescribed a few medicines that can be used \u2018only if required\u2019. The story ends there.\n\nApparently, my sister was undergoing some serious issues with shortness of breath, feeling fatigue, giddy etc., I made her go through complete body check-up and took her directly to Dr. Nikitha Reddy with the reports despite knowing that it is not relevant to a Gynic disorder. The doctor went thoroughly through the reports, prescribed a few injections to boost her hemoglobin levels followed by a few oral medicines. She was clear in her communication to the best extent possible to explain us the seriousness of the issue and the possibility fatality in case if we had neglected for a few more weeks. We had a follow-up session with the doctor after a week or so. During all these three interactions I found this doctor to be very professional, humble and most importantly had patience to listen to her patient\u2019s side of the story which is lacking in many of the senior doctors. Not to forget, she has beautiful handwriting which a normal person with English reading capability can read (not just their in-house pharmacists). During all three visits I had not made to wait more than a few minutes; could be possible as we did not visited during rush hours.\n \nThe world has changed. My friends and I no longer prefer to see any headstrong leaders in the medical industry even if we have any serious ailments, but we rather prefer to be treated by a youngster who walks a mile in our shoes and shows empathy.\n \nOther facilities: Located at the prime place of Attapur with a reasonable car and two-wheeler parking space. Premises have been well maintained all the times. Display monitors with patient's name and their turn to see a doctor, and all other trending technologies used to make the place less chaotic to the patients and their accompanies.\n \nAreas of improvement: Whilst they are good at many areas, there is always a room for improvement in every organization, so does this clinic.\n-        Lets us stop handwritten prescriptions and dosage. It is not only dangerous when some pharmacy dispenser misinterprets but also limits the patient\u2019s freedom to choose their preferred pharmacy to buy from.\n-        My sister complained that the person who tried to give her injection directly in the nerves, couldn\u2019t find the nerve properly and pierced at so many placed on her wrist and hand. She said this wasn\u2019t the case when she got the rest of the shots from a different place. I would still give a benefit of doubt since I wasn\u2019t present at both places and hadn\u2019t witnessed myself.\n-        I spotted a poster near front office waiting area that this clinic is going paperless; however, I still see a lot of papers being used.\n-        Most importantly am I right to assume that this clinic encourages pharmaceutical company representatives to introduce their products directly to the doctors or the clinic themselves? I have seen a group of MedReps on the first floor moving in and out of doctor\u2019s cabins. I am not against this practice but my only apprehension is, this system has made more damage to the patient\u2019s pocket if the doctors chose to prescribe their exorbitantly priced medicines whilst alternative medicines are available at reasonable prices. I am happy to be corrected here.\n \n\nI would strongly recommend people from surrounding areas to give it a try rather travelling to far places searching for successful clinics just because they were established in Adam\u2019s era.

                "review_text": "I wanted my wife to see a Gynic during our vacations in India. She went through a few tests beforehand and wanted an experts advise. Due to time constraints, I had to choose a Gynaecologist within close proximity to our home. Practo has become a handy tool for patients who are deciding whether a doctor/clinic may be the right fit. That\u2019s how I found Zoi.\n \nFront office: I called the front office and booked an appointment with Gynic before our visit. We visited the hospital and I\u2019m astounded as the outlook was way beyond my expectations. Front office staff were friendly; they apologized that the doctor we have been told is not available due to uncertain reasons and have been redirected to Dr. Nikitha Reddy K. We were fine as we weren\u2019t too fussy to choose the doctor since it was just a general catch up to interpret the reports.\n \nThe Doctor: I found Dr. Nikitha Reddy to be calm and competent. Since the issue wasn\u2019t so serious she prescribed a few medicines that can be used \u2018only if required\u2019. The story ends there.\n\nApparently, my sister was undergoing some serious issues with shortness of breath, feeling fatigue, giddy etc., I made her go through complete body check-up and took her directly to Dr. Nikitha Reddy with the reports despite knowing that it is not relevant to a Gynic disorder. The doctor went thoroughly through the reports, prescribed a few injections to boost her hemoglobin levels followed by a few oral medicines. She was clear in her communication to the best extent possible to explain us the seriousness of the issue and the possibility fatality in case if we had neglected for a few more weeks. We had a follow-up session with the doctor after a week or so. During all these three interactions I found this doctor to be very professional, humble and most importantly had patience to listen to her patient\u2019s side of the story which is lacking in many of the senior doctors. Not to forget, she has beautiful handwriting which a normal person with English reading capability can read (not just their in-house pharmacists). During all three visits I had not made to wait more than a few minutes; could be possible as we did not visited during rush hours.\n \nThe world has changed. My friends and I no longer prefer to see any headstrong leaders in the medical industry even if we have any serious ailments, but we rather prefer to be treated by a youngster who walks a mile in our shoes and shows empathy.\n \nOther facilities: Located at the prime place of Attapur with a reasonable car and two-wheeler parking space. Premises have been well maintained all the times. Display monitors with patient's name and their turn to see a doctor, and all other trending technologies used to make the place less chaotic to the patients and their accompanies.\n \nAreas of improvement: Whilst they are good at many areas, there is always a room for improvement in every organization, so does this clinic.\n-        Lets us stop handwritten prescriptions and dosage. It is not only dangerous when some pharmacy dispenser misinterprets but also limits the patient\u2019s freedom to choose their preferred pharmacy to buy from.\n-        My sister complained that the person who tried to give her injection directly in the nerves, couldn\u2019t find the nerve properly and pierced at so many placed on her wrist and hand. She said this wasn\u2019t the case when she got the rest of the shots from a different place. I would still give a benefit of doubt since I wasn\u2019t present at both places and hadn\u2019t witnessed myself.\n-        I spotted a poster near front office waiting area that this clinic is going paperless; however, I still see a lot of papers being used.\n-        Most importantly am I right to assume that this clinic encourages pharmaceutical company representatives to introduce their products directly to the doctors or the clinic themselves? I have seen a group of MedReps on the first floor moving in and out of doctor\u2019s cabins. I am not against this practice but my only apprehension is, this system has made more damage to the patient\u2019s pocket if the doctors chose to prescribe their exorbitantly priced medicines whilst alternative medicines are available at reasonable prices. I am happy to be corrected here.\n \n\nI would strongly recommend people from surrounding areas to give it a try rather travelling to far places searching for successful clinics just because they were established in Adam\u2019s era.
