                "review_text": "About Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu\n\nI came to know about Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu after doing an online search regarding the best Laproscopic surgeons in Hyderabad. After reading several experiences that her pateints have shared on various online forums, I was more optimistic about my problem being resolved in the best possible way. When I first met her on 23rd Jan 2021 in her clinic, I was little nervous about how to get started with sharing my previous health issues. The way Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu received me and made me comfortable and gave me time to settle down, I felt it to be very good. She was very kind and patient to listen to my entire story and gave me the confidence that everything's gonna be alright. She has a very striking personality and has a positive energy all around her, I personally felt like sometimes its the way you are made to feel by doctors matters the most while going for a medical procedure. Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu suggested me to undergo a pelvis scan test which I got it done as per her suggestion at Dr. Madhavi Scan Center. I had several follow up sessions with her and I always made sure that I ask her the questions and clear the thoughts in my mind and Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu was very polite in answering them all. I was diagnosed with a 5 cm fibroid (which I already knew) after the pelvis scan report was out and I wanted to get that removed by Laproscopic surgery. Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu explained me the risks related to the surgery very clearly and assured me not to be too scared about it and prepared me to be ready mentally. She was not hesitant about sharing any relevant information and at the same time never looked to hurry the proceedings. She advised me to get the medical tests done wich were relevant going for the laproscopic surgery. She also prepped me with the required things to be done and carried leading to the surgery. Finally I had my laproscopic surgery done by Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu and her team as planned on 20th Feb 2021 in Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills and the entire experience was very good and smooth. I was able to stand up, walk, get discharged and go home the very next day i.e. 21st Feb 2021. I met the doctor again after a week post the surgery as advised and felt satisfied with the treatment received. \n\nThe best thing I liked about Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu is her humblessness and down to earth attitude. She connects with her pateints in a very friendly nature and not like typical old school doctors (no offence here) and she doesn't get offended to answer our layman/silly questions and has good sense of humour in her answers. Indeed, I feel good and take pride that we have a doctor like Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu in our society and country and we need more doctors as such. I would definitely reccommend Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu to all the ladies who have or undergoing women's related health issues. GOD bless her with best of  health, peace  and life full of bliss.",

They are now treating patients as a customer to make good money. I must say to all such doctors to fear the one who created all of us.\r\n\r\nWe would like to request 'Dr. Vimee Bindra' to kindly conduct some sessions to the upcoming/junior doctors and make them aware about the value of this profession. This is not just a profession to make money, it must be to serve someone who is in pain :)\r\n\r\nWe're glad and proud that we have doctors like Vimee in our society!\r\n\r\nThere is no question of recommending her, she is the BEST among all. I'll not leave thanking the one who referred us to you and that's our close friend 'Bushra'\r\n-------------------------------------------------",

This shows her skills and finesse with which she did my surgery.I had no pain or discomfort contrary to what I had been told about having C sec by my friends.It was the most joyful journey with Dr Vimee. I am blessed with a daughter who too was born hale & hearty.Whenever in doubt no matter what time,I used to call or message her and all my queries were answered in no time.Her availability 24*7 gave me a sense of confidence that in case of emergency I have a trustworthy doctor to rely upon.She has been much more than a  doctor to me.She has been my therapist, supporter, friend, well wisher and an angel in disguise. Even today whenever I am in need the only person I can think of is her. God bless her with abundance success. She is one doctor who is not only true to her profession but is putting great efforts for the humanity.The moment you enter her room she welcomes you with a smile, she never looks tired or irritated no matter how long is the list of your question. Her smile makes you forget your pains and worries. The way she communicates ,it ensures ,you are in safe hands. She listens to you so patiently irrespective of her hectic schedule.I still remember sometimes my visits with her were scheduled immediately after she used to come out from OT ,I would never see a single spec of tiredness on her face. Never made me wait for my visits.Thank you so much Dr Vimee .I can't express my feelings in words.I strongly recommend her to everyone. Once you consult her I am sure you will feel the difference and will be able to relate to what I am saying  through my lines. Best of luck Ma'am! \r\n\r\n \r\n",

I am sure that you would agree with me soon.\n\nIt was my destiny which took me to Dr Vimee Bindra just after I had received my Pregnancy positive report and rest has become an awesome journey. She gives plenty of confidence through out the period and you never realize that you are undergoing your first pregnancy. Whenever I had even a small panic, she just kicked it out. She is always confident on what steps that she is going to take. \nThe day I was admitted to deliver my baby, they started to induce pain from evening and she was available through out night to check any report and give instructions to her fellow juniors. She met me next morning at pre-operative area and her smile reduced my anxiety. Every minute at operation theater was memorable as well. I would always cherish all these memories and it would be so special since it was my first pregnancy and luckily that too with Dr Vimee Bindra.\nEvery single moment that I reached her, I found her positive response and that always helped me to stay calm and positive. I was able to complete my full 10 months and it had been a memorable journey with Dr Vimee Bindra. I wish her every success.\n\nOh, you are still reading this review...please go & visit her and I am sure that you will always feel great for opting her. ",

I had visited several doctors and was offered oral medicines. All the earlier medicines/procedures failed to cure the issue. Then I had the opportunity to consult Dr. Vimee Bindra. She advised some simple diagnostic test. And basis the test results she was the first one to identify the problem and suggested to go for surgery immediately. Her explanation and cooperation with me and my wife was exemplary. I had taken second opinions about the surgery and all doctors advised to go for it. Dr. Vimee Bindra, not only helped through out the procedure, advised and offered best financial package for the hospital. Overall I was very very satisfied with the whole experience and moved by the doctors approach to a poor man like me. I would recommend her to all the people reading this article to consult her once for any opinions and go from there.\n\nI would rate her 10 out of 10 for the whole experience.",

I feel truly blessed to have found her,when I needed her help the most.Mine was a complicated case\u00a0 of\u00a0 multiple uterine fribriods and polyp which my family gynecologist had ignored at early stages.Doctor Vimee in my 1st consultation heard my issues with patience\u00a0 and compassion and explained my diagnosis. Doctor removed the polyp which was troubling me for months,and other doctors had ignored it ,although it was an out patient procedure and I dint even feel pain like a prick. It's when I rested all my worries and knew that i was in safest\u00a0 hands.\nAfter further investigations Dr vimee explained that I will have to undergo a laparoscopic myomectomy.she clearly also mentioned i might have a chance of open surgery because of the huge fibroid size but always assured me that she will try her best to avoid it.\nOn 20th Jan 2021 I underwent my surgery which was estimated to last\u00a0 5 - 6 hours but was successfully completed within 3.5 hours under general anesthesia. I could feel a difference when I woke up in recovery room. Its been 5 days\u00a0 since my surgery and I am healing better by the day .\nA BIG SALUTE\u00a0 AND THANK YOU TO DOCTOR VIMEE BINDRA FOR EVERYTHING !!! ITS TRULY INSPIRING TO HAVE MET AN EXCEPTIONAL DOCTOR, A WOMEN OF SUSTANCE ,IN OUR\u00a0 MIDST.",

I consulted on a lot of forums for trustworthy *** **** ****** recommendations as we hardly knew anyone in the city for such infos .. Had a lot of  advices on such forums which eventually confused me and then as a part of my personnel research and few word of mouth I planned to consult Dr Bindra.She is extremely professional and upfront with no unnecessary scans or medication advices.  Her accessibility is also something one can bank upon both in person and on phone. \nI chose for an elective c section and was slightly disheartened at the birth of my second boy ( wanted a girl this time :p ),  still remember she kept on motivating me in the OT and said how priviledged I am to be the only reigning queen amongst 3 men now,  gave her self example too as she has the same family tree. \nOverall had a very smooth experience with her and my baby was born at 38 weeks exact, all hale and hearty. \nThanx a lot Mam.

She is highly adept and fully updated in her field ** ********* *** without a doubt one can seek her help. She is charming, happy and does not prescribe unnecessary medicines. She takes complete control of her patients and in case of emergency, she ensures that timely assistance is provided. She has been approachable on call, email, whatsapp and I received her responses in minutes of posting my query to her in case I could not go and meet her personally in the hospital. She is charming and always greets with you a smile and remembers your history at the back of her mind. She tries for a normal delivery and uses all means to achieve one and only if it is hampering the health of the mother or her child, does she opt for a cesarean. I have had a very good experience with her and my husband and my entire family highly recommend her. Thank you for the wonderful experience and we look forward to meet you again for a pre-counselling session when we plan our next pregnancy, if and when it happens. ",

I have been suffering with severe pain and heavy bleeding since 3 years due to polyp and fibroids, I was in US since 6 years and literally visited 3 gynecologists and discussed all these issues several times and they suggested me for complete removal of uterus which I really don\u2019t want. \n\nFinally I found Vimee Bindra on google search and I saw her video (How to avoid Hysterectomy) then I visited her. She is very professional and equally caring for the patient. She explained the issue and suggested for a small surgery and she gave me lot of confidence that its very simple and easy. After the surgery I completely relived from the pain which I have been suffering since years. I will never forget her in my life as she gave my happy and painless life back. Your awesome Mam..:-)\n\nExcellent doctor , very knowledgeable , professional and caring. I strongly recommend her to all woman and I will refer her in my office , family and friends. I hope you will reach extreme heights in your profession and you will be always in your patients hearts because of your wonderful treatment.  \nOnce again thank you so much for all your service and treatment.

When I first met her on 23rd Jan 2021 in her clinic, I was little nervous about how to get started with sharing my previous health issues. The way Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu received me and made me comfortable and gave me time to settle down, I felt it to be very good. She was very kind and patient to listen to my entire story and gave me the confidence that everything's gonna be alright. She has a very striking personality and has a positive energy all around her, I personally felt like sometimes its the way you are made to feel by doctors matters the most while going for a medical procedure. Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu suggested me to undergo a pelvis scan test which I got it done as per her suggestion at Dr. Madhavi Scan Center. I had several follow up sessions with her and I always made sure that I ask her the questions and clear the thoughts in my mind and Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu was very polite in answering them all. I was diagnosed with a 5 cm fibroid (which I already knew) after the pelvis scan report was out and I wanted to get that removed by Laproscopic surgery. Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu explained me the risks related to the surgery very clearly and assured me not to be too scared about it and prepared me to be ready mentally. She was not hesitant about sharing any relevant information and at the same time never looked to hurry the proceedings. She advised me to get the medical tests done wich were relevant going for the laproscopic surgery. She also prepped me with the required things to be done and carried leading to the surgery. Finally I had my laproscopic surgery done by Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu and her team as planned on 20th Feb 2021 in Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills and the entire experience was very good and smooth. I was able to stand up, walk, get discharged and go home the very next day i.e. 21st Feb 2021. I met the doctor again after a week post the surgery as advised and felt satisfied with the treatment received. \n\nThe best thing I liked about Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu is her humblessness and down to earth attitude. She connects with her pateints in a very friendly nature and not like typical old school doctors (no offence here) and she doesn't get offended to answer our layman/silly questions and has good sense of humour in her answers. Indeed, I feel good and take pride that we have a doctor like Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu in our society and country and we need more doctors as such. I would definitely reccommend Dr. Vimee Bindra Basu to all the ladies who have or undergoing women's related health issues. GOD bless her with best of  health, peace  and life full of bliss.",

May you get the highest reward for your services delivered to the people.\r\n\r\nApart from that you are a wonderful human being and among one of the precious gems Apollo has!!!\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your support!\r\n\r\nAdeeba & Arshad\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDoctors in this period of time lost the aim of being into this profession and known to create a good scary script for their patients. They are now treating patients as a customer to make good money. I must say to all such doctors to fear the one who created all of us.\r\n\r\nWe would like to request 'Dr. Vimee Bindra' to kindly conduct some sessions to the upcoming/junior doctors and make them aware about the value of this profession. This is not just a profession to make money, it must be to serve someone who is in pain :)\r\n\r\nWe're glad and proud that we have doctors like Vimee in our society!\r\n\r\nThere is no question of recommending her, she is the BEST among all. I'll not leave thanking the one who referred us to you and that's our close friend 'Bushra'\r\n-------------------------------------------------",

This shows her skills and finesse with which she did my surgery.I had no pain or discomfort contrary to what I had been told about having C sec by my friends.It was the most joyful journey with Dr Vimee. I am blessed with a daughter who too was born hale & hearty.Whenever in doubt no matter what time,I used to call or message her and all my queries were answered in no time.Her availability 24*7 gave me a sense of confidence that in case of emergency I have a trustworthy doctor to rely upon.She has been much more than a  doctor to me.She has been my therapist, supporter, friend, well wisher and an angel in disguise. Even today whenever I am in need the only person I can think of is her. God bless her with abundance success. She is one doctor who is not only true to her profession but is putting great efforts for the humanity.The moment you enter her room she welcomes you with a smile, she never looks tired or irritated no matter how long is the list of your question. Her smile makes you forget your pains and worries. The way she communicates ,it ensures ,you are in safe hands. She listens to you so patiently irrespective of her hectic schedule.I still remember sometimes my visits with her were scheduled immediately after she used to come out from OT ,I would never see a single spec of tiredness on her face. Never made me wait for my visits.Thank you so much Dr Vimee .I can't express my feelings in words.I strongly recommend her to everyone. Once you consult her I am sure you will feel the difference and will be able to relate to what I am saying  through my lines. Best of luck Ma'am! \r\n\r\n \r\n",

I am sure that you would agree with me soon.\n\nIt was my destiny which took me to Dr Vimee Bindra just after I had received my Pregnancy positive report and rest has become an awesome journey. She gives plenty of confidence through out the period and you never realize that you are undergoing your first pregnancy. Whenever I had even a small panic, she just kicked it out. She is always confident on what steps that she is going to take. \nThe day I was admitted to deliver my baby, they started to induce pain from evening and she was available through out night to check any report and give instructions to her fellow juniors. She met me next morning at pre-operative area and her smile reduced my anxiety. Every minute at operation theater was memorable as well. I would always cherish all these memories and it would be so special since it was my first pregnancy and luckily that too with Dr Vimee Bindra.\nEvery single moment that I reached her, I found her positive response and that always helped me to stay calm and positive. I was able to complete my full 10 months and it had been a memorable journey with Dr Vimee Bindra. I wish her every success.\n\nOh, you are still reading this review...please go & visit her and I am sure that you will always feel great for opting her. ",

I had visited several doctors and was offered oral medicines. All the earlier medicines/procedures failed to cure the issue. Then I had the opportunity to consult Dr. Vimee Bindra. She advised some simple diagnostic test. And basis the test results she was the first one to identify the problem and suggested to go for surgery immediately. Her explanation and cooperation with me and my wife was exemplary. I had taken second opinions about the surgery and all doctors advised to go for it. Dr. Vimee Bindra, not only helped through out the procedure, advised and offered best financial package for the hospital. Overall I was very very satisfied with the whole experience and moved by the doctors approach to a poor man like me. I would recommend her to all the people reading this article to consult her once for any opinions and go from there.\n\nI would rate her 10 out of 10 for the whole experience.",

I feel truly blessed to have found her,when I needed her help the most.Mine was a complicated case\u00a0 of\u00a0 multiple uterine fribriods and polyp which my family gynecologist had ignored at early stages.Doctor Vimee in my 1st consultation heard my issues with patience\u00a0 and compassion and explained my diagnosis. Doctor removed the polyp which was troubling me for months,and other doctors had ignored it ,although it was an out patient procedure and I dint even feel pain like a prick. It's when I rested all my worries and knew that i was in safest\u00a0 hands.\nAfter further investigations Dr vimee explained that I will have to undergo a laparoscopic myomectomy.she clearly also mentioned i might have a chance of open surgery because of the huge fibroid size but always assured me that she will try her best to avoid it.\nOn 20th Jan 2021 I underwent my surgery which was estimated to last\u00a0 5 - 6 hours but was successfully completed within 3.5 hours under general anesthesia. I could feel a difference when I woke up in recovery room. Its been 5 days\u00a0 since my surgery and I am healing better by the day .\nA BIG SALUTE\u00a0 AND THANK YOU TO DOCTOR VIMEE BINDRA FOR EVERYTHING !!! ITS TRULY INSPIRING TO HAVE MET AN EXCEPTIONAL DOCTOR, A WOMEN OF SUSTANCE ,IN OUR\u00a0 MIDST.",

I consulted on a lot of forums for trustworthy *** **** ****** recommendations as we hardly knew anyone in the city for such infos .. Had a lot of  advices on such forums which eventually confused me and then as a part of my personnel research and few word of mouth I planned to consult Dr Bindra.She is extremely professional and upfront with no unnecessary scans or medication advices.  Her accessibility is also something one can bank upon both in person and on phone. \nI chose for an elective c section and was slightly disheartened at the birth of my second boy ( wanted a girl this time :p ),  still remember she kept on motivating me in the OT and said how priviledged I am to be the only reigning queen amongst 3 men now,  gave her self example too as she has the same family tree. \nOverall had a very smooth experience with her and my baby was born at 38 weeks exact, all hale and hearty. \nThanx a lot Mam.

I had put my complete faith in her and her sound advice and in return she ensured that I only focus on my pregnancy and enjoy every bit of it. She is highly adept and fully updated in her field ** ********* *** without a doubt one can seek her help. She is charming, happy and does not prescribe unnecessary medicines. She takes complete control of her patients and in case of emergency, she ensures that timely assistance is provided. She has been approachable on call, email, whatsapp and I received her responses in minutes of posting my query to her in case I could not go and meet her personally in the hospital. She is charming and always greets with you a smile and remembers your history at the back of her mind. She tries for a normal delivery and uses all means to achieve one and only if it is hampering the health of the mother or her child, does she opt for a cesarean. I have had a very good experience with her and my husband and my entire family highly recommend her. Thank you for the wonderful experience and we look forward to meet you again for a pre-counselling session when we plan our next pregnancy, if and when it happens. ",

I have been suffering with severe pain and heavy bleeding since 3 years due to polyp and fibroids, I was in US since 6 years and literally visited 3 gynecologists and discussed all these issues several times and they suggested me for complete removal of uterus which I really don\u2019t want. \n\nFinally I found Vimee Bindra on google search and I saw her video (How to avoid Hysterectomy) then I visited her. She is very professional and equally caring for the patient. She explained the issue and suggested for a small surgery and she gave me lot of confidence that its very simple and easy. After the surgery I completely relived from the pain which I have been suffering since years. I will never forget her in my life as she gave my happy and painless life back. Your awesome Mam..:-)\n\nExcellent doctor , very knowledgeable , professional and caring. I strongly recommend her to all woman and I will refer her in my office , family and friends. I hope you will reach extreme heights in your profession and you will be always in your patients hearts because of your wonderful treatment.  \nOnce again thank you so much for all your service and treatment.

She is such a positive person that I had the problem of spotting in my 1st trimester and had almost decided to leave my job and go back home. But it was Dr Bindra who explained me things rationally and encouraged me to have faith. Now I am in my 6th month with everything perfectly fine just because of her.\r\n \r\nShe is full of energy and such a positive person and meticulous about details. Have never ever been apprehensive about asking silly questions @ silly hours to her and she has logical answers to all my questions. I belong from a family of doctors and had initially decided will go for delivery to my home town but such is the charisma of Dr Bindra that finally I HAVE DECIDED TO GET MY BABY DELIVERED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF DR BINDRA.\r\n\r\n All that I have to say is that I am blessed to be under her guidance. \r\n",

She never minced her words when we asked her about our problem and never kept us in the dark. She always kept her appointments and met us with a warm smile and greeting every time. I ended up having a C-section and to my surprise it was not as scary as my family and friends had told me. She was cheerful throughout the procedure and helped me with the recovery. My follow ups went very smooth too and both the doctor and us were very much satisfied with my healing. I now feel as healthy as always and happy with our healthy son. I would definitely recommend expecting parents to go to Doctor Vimee Bindra for a wonderful experience.\r\n\r\nThank you Doctor Vimee :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This being the first time, I was nervous, at various stages and every time, I visited you, you would instil confidence in me. My husband and I are so grateful to you for how much you've gone out of your way, for the wealth of information you provided us and the quality of time you spent with us post-op to just let us know \"It's all going to be OK!\"\n\nIt's obvious you're amazing at what you do!\u00a0 We will recommend you at any chance we get, as a great doctor, but more importantly, a great human being and a fine lady. If every doctor strives to be as caring and generous as you, the world would be filled with smiles and laughter instead of pain and sorrow.

First of all I was deeply touched by Dr. Vimee' s calm attitude and friendly demeanor. She discussed with us all the treatment options. I am from out of state and we came to Apollo just to get treated by her. She understood our time constraints. We also further discussed with her online and decided to go for robotic laproscopy. The surgery went fine and I was released within 2 days. I am overall okay now. She is the best doctor I had seen who can properly relate with her patients and make them feel at ease. All the hospital staffs and Dr. Archana mam were very friendly, helpful and understood both Hindi and English. I trusted her with my health and that's why we opted for robotic laproscopy. I would recommend her for endometriosis treatment and robotic surgery.",

Now, about a week later, I am back to normal activities with minimal strain and couldn't have hoped for any better alternative procedure, hospital or doctor. \n\nDr. Vimee is an expert with most comforting care.

Since she was already late and had a lot of patients waiting for her, she gave only 5 mins of her extremely valuable time to me..didnt give me a chance to explain my problems in detail. Didnt bother to allow me to ask questions. Didnt consider it important to tell me what the problem was. So i basically had to pay 700 bucks for an unacceptable kinda service. I understand she is famous and must be earning a lot, but if she doesnt believe in making patients feel comfortable and solving their issues rather than just being arrogant,rude and inconsiderate, that would be appreciated. This might be one another case wherein doctors are not concerned about their patients' problems in this country anymore...extremely sad & disappointing.",

She spends quality time with patients, gives space to patient incl.patient's attender(s), understand root cause of the problem through proper diagnosis and recommends medication starting from low intensity. We are really lucky to have a wonderful doctor and till birth of our baby, we completely trusted her advice without a second thought. Lastly, Doctor has very good sense of humor!!",

She provided a very good support and helped me round the clock with several queries. My thyroid level are now under control and I am blessed with a baby 1.5 years back. Dr. Vimee is still in touch and always extends support whenever required. I think in my case identifying the thyroid problem correctly at early stage and providing treatment was more important for smooth delivery and I believe no one else could have done this better than Dr.Vimee.

Initially we went for check up, at that time I was not went to Hospital, but my brothers were present at Dr. Vimee Bindra mam with my mom. In their words i heard that Mam is very friendly and good in briefing everything to my mom about surgery.\n\nAnd after one week, she made laproscopic surgery to my mom.\n\nLater, I also realized that my brothers saying was correct. Mam is a great doctor.. \nAny person can be a doctor, but only few will remain with their fame/reputation..\n\nNow she is good in health condition. We love our MOTHER more than any thing.. All were celebrating Laxmi Pooja on diwali time, but we were celebrating with our mom Laxmi at Apollo Hospitals, J/H, Hyderabad.. Great happiness for us infact..\n\n\nThanx alot mam.. we are always greatful to you..",

After that i had water leakage from Vagina. this was very annoying and i had to use sanitary pads day and night.\nThe doctor in Netherlands could not diagnose the problem. Three months after surgery , i met Dr Vimee Bindra in Apollo hospitals Jubilee hills Hyderabad. In my first visit, she diagnosed that urine ws leaking from the vagina and I had a Vesico Vaginal Fistula.This was a complication from  the Histerectomy.

I was scared to find a good doctor, considering I moved to Hyderabad 6 months into my pregnancy. After some research, I visited her, and was confident from the get go. She was considerate, and gave confidence that I could do normal, and everything was smooth.\nHad a c-sec with her later in August, almost at due time, and she brought me my first child, heathy and safe. But never I lost confidence that c-sec was needed for this one, and she had explored possibilities of normal before deciding for c-sec.\nThanks a lot doctor. As a Gynecologist, she has been excellent, and strikes the exact balance of being a doctor and a friend when needed. Also, never felt too much of scans/meds being pushed upon, which has become a trend now a days. She even supported us over holidays when needed. Cant thank enough for the memorable journey, to get my cute little baby in my hands. ",
