"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Consulted for Pregnancy confirmation and there on frequent monthly checkups

Initially we consulted Swathi mam for Pregnancy confirmation and for counselling regarding covid situations. She listened patiently about our questions and clearly explained that there is no need to worry due to covid(About Vaccination/Hospitalization/Baby Health....)

After speaking to her we are clear that COVID is not a constraint for continuing with pregnancy. There on we continued for monthly checkups and also when required. In every consultation she explained about reports of both mother and baby health.

Unfortunately we need to plan our delivery in my hometown but not in Hyderabad, so we moved to our hometown after 8th month consultation. In last consultation also she guided what needs to be done for remaining months.

Last week we blessed with Baby Boy, both mother and child are doing good.
