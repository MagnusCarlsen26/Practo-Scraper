She provided us with options of what we wanted to continue ahead with. In 2023, my wife is pregnant with 10 weeks now. We are incredibly appreciative and thankful to Dr. Avani. Dr. Avani has been an answer to our prayers. We highly recommend her and if we could give her more than five stars we would definitely.\n\nAnd thank you to all the nurses, especially Gopi (receptionist) who is always very attentive, helpful and well informed, great job Gopi; you guys are awesome!\n\n\n\n",
