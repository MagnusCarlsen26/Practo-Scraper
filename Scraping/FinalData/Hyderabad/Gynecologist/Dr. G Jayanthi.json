                "review_text": "The wait time was more than an hour for me, but it was understandable since i was told the doctor had an emergency surgery to attend to. While waiting I was told to check my weight by the staff - even though my consultation hadn't even begun yet and it did not relate to my health concern. I therefore declined and thankfully, was not asked about the same afterwards.  The staff then told me consult another doctor in the clinic and she was very helpful and patient with my questions and encouraged me to give more information. She also reassured me about the symptoms and that they are common. Moreover, she called the doctor and let me  talk to her - Dr. Jayanthi was friendly and listened well too, despite being occupied. Just another thing that bothered me was that given the nature of my health concern, they needed to know whether or not I have been sexually active. But instead of asking that question directly or at least try to imply the same, they asked me if I am married or not - both the attending doctor and Dr. Jayanthi. I understand these questions are taboo in our society, but doctors should find ways to communicate them better. Especially because what if someone is unmarried and sexually active? Or married but not sexually active? The treatment can get affected in both cases and might not be accurate for the patient. So please, I hope you do better and don't treat sexual activity as taboo or something to criticise before marriage. It is okay! The rest was alright and I got prescribed the medicines which I was explained how and when to take.  I was also told I could visit again in the evening since Dr. Jayanthi would be back by then, but I chose not to as it's far from my place and I got the information I needed. ",

While waiting I was told to check my weight by the staff - even though my consultation hadn't even begun yet and it did not relate to my health concern. I therefore declined and thankfully, was not asked about the same afterwards.  The staff then told me consult another doctor in the clinic and she was very helpful and patient with my questions and encouraged me to give more information. She also reassured me about the symptoms and that they are common. Moreover, she called the doctor and let me  talk to her - Dr. Jayanthi was friendly and listened well too, despite being occupied. Just another thing that bothered me was that given the nature of my health concern, they needed to know whether or not I have been sexually active. But instead of asking that question directly or at least try to imply the same, they asked me if I am married or not - both the attending doctor and Dr. Jayanthi. I understand these questions are taboo in our society, but doctors should find ways to communicate them better. Especially because what if someone is unmarried and sexually active? Or married but not sexually active? The treatment can get affected in both cases and might not be accurate for the patient. So please, I hope you do better and don't treat sexual activity as taboo or something to criticise before marriage. It is okay! The rest was alright and I got prescribed the medicines which I was explained how and when to take.  I was also told I could visit again in the evening since Dr. Jayanthi would be back by then, but I chose not to as it's far from my place and I got the information I needed. ",
