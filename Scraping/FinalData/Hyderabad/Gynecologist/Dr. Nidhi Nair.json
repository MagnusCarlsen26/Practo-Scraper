Being my first experience i had so much difficulty of pushing and handling pains and she was shouting in labour room and being a doctor she has to be supportive and encouraging instead of shouting and discouraging.wrst experience with her and even staff.they don't even communicate properly and may be they block old numbers.whenever i call them it will be busy and it will get connected from new number.i don't know what's going on with the hospital.better not to visit this hospital.\n",
