I have never seen such a genuine and kind doctor with so much patience who explains in detail and answers all your questions, responds back in case of emergencies and provides such a good treatment. We consulted Dr. Swetha when my wife had to undergo D&C. she did the D&C and then we continued consulting her for treatment for next pregnancy. My wife conceived again and Dr Swetha performed regular scans and provided necessary treatment for the baby growth and ensured the baby is delivered. Post delivery my wife had some other general complications but she stood by us patiently and provided us lot of morale support. I am very thankful to Dr. Swetha for giving such wonderful care and treatment to my wife and help us get a miracle baby boy. ** ***** **** **** *** ********** *********** *************** I definitely & strongly recommend Dr Swetha.",

She has never rushed a consultation session and would only let me leave until all my questions are answered and I'm comfortable.

It is an honor to portrait our happiness and over all experience with the journey of my Child from the day of my wife's pregnancy. My wife is strongly recommending this doctor to our friends who has been suffering from different Gynec issues.

She has never rushed a consultation session and would only let me leave until all my questions are answered and I'm comfortable. Overall it was a great experience visiting her and would highly recommend her for anyone looking for a reliable gynecologist/obstetrician.",

I had 5 visits with her so far and she was always helpful to understand my concerns and lead me into right direction. I had to move to my home town due to COVID outbreak in Hyderabad, otherwise I'd have loved to have Dr. Swetha deliver my baby. Thank you Dr. Swetha for all the care and we wish to meet you soon.",
