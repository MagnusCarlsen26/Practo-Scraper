It is grossly mismanaged, chaotic and disorganized run by callous employees who lack basic professional courtesy. The appointment booking through practo after being confirmed was not honored, pre-poned by the hospital from 8:30 pm to 7:30 pm, when arrived at 7:30 was refused by the reception. After much ado, they caught up and registered, (cash only, no reciept). After ever changing wait times and conflicting information, 30 minutes later we were made to sit in one of the three  OP consultation rooms, that are interconnected and through which  their \"Star\" doctor jumps through. There were two separate patients sitting in one room at a time , the house keeping staff,  the clerical staff, all constantly walking through, constantly peeking in. Dr. Khan was hurried and the prevalent chaos impeded from careful assessment of the patients medical history and was offered one of their Viscosupplementation packages even before diagnostic x-ray could be seen by Dr. Khan in another OP consultation room.Five minutes spent with the Dr. Khan was barely satisfactory. The whole experience is a huge deterrent, especially the aggressively blatant marketing paraphernalia of posters, newspaper clippings,  awards, textbooks and German memorabilia. This did not inspire trust nor excude care but came across as a very transactional establishment that fails to live upto and deliver heath care.",

Then, I was being told that there could be a ligament issue and i may have to go for MRI (of course i would get some discount too). When i asked cant the problem be solved with physiotherapy, doctor said it will be time taking. \n3) Consultation: 300, X-Ray 500, Medicines 700 - Time spent with doctor <5 mins.\n\nOh! by the way..my case file was lost by the doctor as there were more than 10 case files just scattered on his table and therefore, they gave me a new case file... ha ha ha******* ******* ** ***** *** *******",

It is grossly mismanaged, chaotic and disorganized run by callous employees who lack basic professional courtesy. The appointment booking through practo after being confirmed was not honored, pre-poned by the hospital from 8:30 pm to 7:30 pm, when arrived at 7:30 was refused by the reception. After much ado, they caught up and registered, (cash only, no reciept). After ever changing wait times and conflicting information, 30 minutes later we were made to sit in one of the three  OP consultation rooms, that are interconnected and through which  their \"Star\" doctor jumps through. There were two separate patients sitting in one room at a time , the house keeping staff,  the clerical staff, all constantly walking through, constantly peeking in. Dr. Khan was hurried and the prevalent chaos impeded from careful assessment of the patients medical history and was offered one of their Viscosupplementation packages even before diagnostic x-ray could be seen by Dr. Khan in another OP consultation room.Five minutes spent with the Dr. Khan was barely satisfactory. The whole experience is a huge deterrent, especially the aggressively blatant marketing paraphernalia of posters, newspaper clippings,  awards, textbooks and German memorabilia. This did not inspire trust nor excude care but came across as a very transactional establishment that fails to live upto and deliver heath care.",

Doctor didn't even do a physical examination.\n Just asked to go and get an X-Ray, which said my bone is fine. Then, I was being told that there could be a ligament issue and i may have to go for MRI (of course i would get some discount too). When i asked cant the problem be solved with physiotherapy, doctor said it will be time taking. \n3) Consultation: 300, X-Ray 500, Medicines 700 - Time spent with doctor <5 mins.\n\nOh! by the way..my case file was lost by the doctor as there were more than 10 case files just scattered on his table and therefore, they gave me a new case file... ha ha ha******* ******* ** ***** *** *******",

I started thinking it's life long problem. But my problems were increasing a day by day so thought to meet the best Dr. I searched on google & found about Dr. Jawad. I visited to the hospital and staff were cool and friendly. After few normal/routine test i met with my best Dr. ever. He just spent less than 10 mins, listen to my problems and prescribed few medicines and left to attend may be emergency patient. I started seeing the improvement since the day one. It's been 4 days now  and i started living my normal life, feeling happy, energetic, positive and strong. I only regret why didn't I meet him earlier. I will highly recommend Dr. Jawad for any kind of orthopedic problems. Isse zyada nahi kuch kahunga verna suraj ko diya dikhane jaisa ho jayega. ",
