"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Foot & Ankle,",0,0,YES,"Dr Surya is absolutely wonderful! I took my mom to see him as a second opinion as her previous doctor was suggesting surgery for calcium deposits. She was in a lot of pain and was hardly able to walk.
Dr Surya took ample time to walk both her and me through the issue. He explained how this could be resolved with physiotherapy and exercise. He strongly advised against surgery and explained that the pain is temporary and is only due to inflammation.
He also has a great sense of humour, even my mom was so happy after meeting him. He set her mind at ease and she was already feeling better right after walking out of his chamber.
It has been 5 days since she started physiotherapy and she's already walking with a spring in her step and is even able to climb stairs.
