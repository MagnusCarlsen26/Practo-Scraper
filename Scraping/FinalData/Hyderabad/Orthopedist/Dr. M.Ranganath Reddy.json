Also he explains the medication and exercise clearly to the patient and the escort. Spends quality time with patient to know their condition better. Best thing is , without proper diagnosis he wouldn't prescribe anything . \"Vaidyo Narayano Harihi\" aptly suits him.I wish there are more doctors like him offering great service to humanity.I sincerely thank him from the bottom of my heart.

We are very happy and satisfied with his treatment and we are thankful to doctor.

So ,I took her to Ranganath sir. The way he receives the patient is so warming. He is very professional and curing the patient is his ultimate goal. Also he explains the medication and exercise clearly to the patient and the escort. Spends quality time with patient to know their condition better. Best thing is , without proper diagnosis he wouldn't prescribe anything . \"Vaidyo Narayano Harihi\" aptly suits him.I wish there are more doctors like him offering great service to humanity.I sincerely thank him from the bottom of my heart.

He is extremely professional, efficient and personable in coordinating the numerous facets needed for a smooth experience. In addition to what a patient may expect as routine in scheduling surgery, he on numerous occasions went above and beyond by placing that extra call to assure we had taken care of things  which were required to do. He not only made my mother feel confident  but also took care that there would be no issues for surgery..he also made her feel like he personally cared about this being as painless as possible for my mom. Today is the third day post surgery.  She got discharged yesterday. She's doing very well.. all credits to the doctor. We will always be thankful and grateful to  you sir!!!!",
