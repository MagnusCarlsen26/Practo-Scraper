It was a type 6 fracture with separation with multiple fractures in tibial plateau and crack going to 1/3rd the length of tibia, with displacement. Dr Reddy stabilized the knee with plate and screws once the swelling subsided and then the recovery period started. Right from the starting it was clear that the fracture was pretty complex. Knee surgery was successful and no complications arose . What helped us was the confidence of doctor and explanation of what was happening and discussion about what to expect next at each stage. The recovery is still ongoing but I am in much better condition now and am much more confident now. Fracture recoveries are long drawn processes and you need a doctor who has the expertise and is responsive. Dr Reddy has both these qualities.",

The Doctor came 30 minutes late to the schedule appointment time. I was the first patient and when I have been asked to enter his cabin for consultation, their was a person already sitting (not a patient) inside. I found this really unprofessional and unethical. He was in rush and very little attentive to my case. He has done the primary observation of my knee with the Lachman Test only for my injured knee (supposed to be done as well for the other knee to understand the slackness). Before he provide his view on the diagnosis, he asked for my MRI report and said you need to go under knife (i.e.ACL Reconstruction), which is mention in the MRI report in clear English. \n\nSecondly I have been asked to pay Rs. 500/- as consultation (as asked by the receptionist) fee while the receipt shows a consultation charge of Rs. 300/- from the clinic on 7th September. I have written the same to the doctor as a reply to the email of receipt and still waiting for the reply from the doctor.\n\nThanks.\nDr. Sudhansu Sahoo (PhD)",

It was a type 6 fracture with separation with multiple fractures in tibial plateau and crack going to 1/3rd the length of tibia, with displacement. Dr Reddy stabilized the knee with plate and screws once the swelling subsided and then the recovery period started. Right from the starting it was clear that the fracture was pretty complex. Knee surgery was successful and no complications arose . What helped us was the confidence of doctor and explanation of what was happening and discussion about what to expect next at each stage. The recovery is still ongoing but I am in much better condition now and am much more confident now. Fracture recoveries are long drawn processes and you need a doctor who has the expertise and is responsive. Dr Reddy has both these qualities.",

The Doctor came 30 minutes late to the schedule appointment time. I was the first patient and when I have been asked to enter his cabin for consultation, their was a person already sitting (not a patient) inside. I found this really unprofessional and unethical. He was in rush and very little attentive to my case. He has done the primary observation of my knee with the Lachman Test only for my injured knee (supposed to be done as well for the other knee to understand the slackness). Before he provide his view on the diagnosis, he asked for my MRI report and said you need to go under knife (i.e.ACL Reconstruction), which is mention in the MRI report in clear English. \n\nSecondly I have been asked to pay Rs. 500/- as consultation (as asked by the receptionist) fee while the receipt shows a consultation charge of Rs. 300/- from the clinic on 7th September. I have written the same to the doctor as a reply to the email of receipt and still waiting for the reply from the doctor.\n\nThanks.\nDr. Sudhansu Sahoo (PhD)",
