I specifically asked him is any physiotherapy required then he said no. After 2 weeks again i visited him bcz my pain dint reduce. He said it happens it may get reduce in one month or one year or sometimes never. When i consulted other doctor he said it was normal muscle injury u never had a fracture. Same reply i got from 3 other doctors. They all suggested me for physiotherapy and i am feeling better after it. It would have been better earlier only if i wouldn't visited Krishna Kiran",
