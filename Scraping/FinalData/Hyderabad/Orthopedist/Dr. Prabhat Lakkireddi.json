                "review_text": "I had been operated by Dr. Prabhat Lakkireddi on Aug 16 2018 for an Arthroscopic Bankart repair surgery on my right shoulder, which is a minimally invasive surgery to repair instability and restore function of a dislocated shoulder. I live in the United States and the injury first occurred while playing volleyball and later dislocated on several occasions while swimming, basketball, cricket etc. totaling to about 6 painful dislocations. This is common in Athletes wherein a few tend to put the shoulder back into position without pain, but for me, I am well built at 6ft/ 85kgs and when the shoulder dislocates the whole body is like locked and the only position of the body is to kneel and lay my arm on the ground. The body in an uncomfortable position and the pain is immense.\n\nOn my visit to India, I've searched the web and found Dr. Lakkireddi on Practo. He was my first choice but was hesitant to visit him because of where he practiced. (Don't ask me why). I had seen a couple of Doctors before I visited Dr Lakkireddi but finally opted purely based off the reviews on Practo and this time followed my gut and gave it a shot. I was very impressed on the first visit for the reason, he speaks to you as someone you've know for a while and him just being more than a Doctor. Most Doctors explain the issue and the treatment needed which to me is common, but its the confidence that Doctor creates in the patient who needs to get treated moreover a surgery. I've been in pain for more than 2yrs and did not want to go under the knife for the wrong reasons. \n\nI had planned for a surgery earlier at another hospital, had my MRI reports/ blood work done but backed off due to bad experience just 1 hour before the surgery. Dr. Lakkireddi used the same reports and blood work to diagnose and I decided to go for the surgery without a second thought. It all happened in 10-15min and that's the confidence he created in me as a Doctor that you don't see anymore or rarely. \n\nI am proud that I made my decision and thanks to Dr. Lakkireddi and his office assistant Venkat, Dr Shekar Reddy (Anesthesia) and his other team members (Sorry I don't recall the names) for helping me out. The surgery was a bit complex than expected as I might have damaged due to multiple dislocations. Its been 4 months that I had the surgery and I am recovering well. I had done a lot of research online on the Bankart Repair before the surgery and being sports person and its easy for me to do a rehab and adopt to physiotherapy. I've visited Dr Lakkireddi a couple of times after the surgery but never got a chance to interact on the Physiotherapy as I had to leave back to the U.S. I am working on my own and have a full movement but will go for muscle strengthening over the next few months and I shall see Dr. Lakkireddi on my next visit to India. \n\nRegards,\nVamsee Mopuru",

I would like explain in detail about what happened and how Dr..Prabhath sir was helpful, sorry for the detailed feedback and hope this helps patients with similar problem.\n\nBackground: I was frequently twisting my ankle from last three years, I visited some orthopedic doctors in Chennai (I was staying in Chennai at that time and later moved to Hyderabad) and I didn't find them helpful and neither they understood my problem. I visited Dr.Prabhath in February when I again badly injured my ankle while playing Cricket and on my first visit Dr told me there is some problem with one of my Ligament called ATFL and suggested to take rest and after a month of taking some tablets suggested a CT Scan. In the scan it is confirmed that my ATFL ligament got tored and it requires surgery to reconstruct.I took other doctors opinion in Hyderabad and they also said  the same about surgery.\n\nProcess: I got my ATFL ligament  reconstructed with internal Brace in June 2018 with Dr Prabhath and  it's been close to 6months and I started jogging with no pain and as of now my ankle looks stable.I would say recovery is very good with very less medication and I appreciate how all this process went through with Dr.Prabhat sir.\n\nFor the following reasons I would suggest Dr.Prabhath Lakireddy.\n1. Detailed explanation of the problem. Dr.Prabhath explained me what happened to mmy ankle and what should be done and what happens if we don't go for it's repair.\n2. Time he spends with patients and having lot of patience in answering our doubts and questions.\n3. Before the surgery he told me the procedure name and even told me to check in Google for some details and at the same time asked me not to go for too much details which might confuse.\n4. Surgery went very well and I was discharged next day with an advise of rest for 2 months and a total rest for 6 months. I was suggested Calcium supplements for 3 months and pain killers for two weeks. Very less medication or no unnecessary medications.\n5. No physiotherapy suggested. He told few excersices to do everyday and it helped a lot.\n6. Avoids unnecessary lab tests and he asks every time if we can afford scan or not which is very rare.\n\nI am very happy with Dr.Prabhat Lakireddy *** ** ** *** ** *** **** ******* ** ****** A big thank you sir !!!!!\n\nPavan Kumar Ambati,\nHyderabad.\n",

Always smiling.. The point is we can express our problems or ask doubts without any hesitation\n2.Unlike other doctors, he explains the internal details of the surgery which builds the confidence in us and clears all confusions..\n3.He had decided a date for surgery.. but we had not get the insurance approval and there was no proper intimation from insurance billing team.. I was in a confusion whether to be on fast as that was the day of surgery.. Doctor himself called me in the morning and told me to be on fast and will do the surgery in the afternoon.. I felt very happy.. Yes, he cares for his patients..\n                                                       \nWhile coming to the staff, Venkat and Karuna are very supportive..

Was able to walk with the support of walker immediately the next day.. Met the doctor again on 15th March 2017, I went on wheel chair to the doctor's consultation room.. He told(funnily) that he would charge me for the wheel chair if I come next time and told that I do not need to use walker or any brace.. I started walking without walker and brace immediately after two days from then.. Then next time, i.e on 1st April 2017 I went to him alone without any support for walking.. The doctor was very happy upon seeing my progress.. obviously I was the happiest too..\n                                                              \nThank you sir for your help and support.",

I had heard about Prabhat sir from a colleague of mine and visited. The doc had recommended to get a couple of tests done part which he had recommended me to get a meniscus surgery done for a permanent fix. The doc never hurried and tried to give me more time, explained the crux of the issue and even sent me a few videos for me to understand and mentally prepare myself. He was extremely professional during surgery right from his patience in explaining the issue in detail both to family and me before surgery n after surgery to his care for his patients makes him stand out. While it was supposed to be a meniscus surgery once he started the scopy and realized that my ACL was damaged as well, explained the issue to my family showed photos and took their consent to fix that as well since it was the root cause of the meniscus injury n a better permanent fix. I really liked his honesty here as he could have simple gone ahead with meniscus repair as planned but his genuine intent of fixing the knee for good and suggesting whats the right thing to do for patients is appreciable. The time he gives to patients even during appointments is noteworthy. If you are looking for an ortho look no further. He has a really good support team as well Venkat who manages appointments n paperwork, Krishna one of the physio under him are very professional and good at what they do. Thanks Prabhat sir n team for a successful surgery I was able to walk with a walker the next day after surgery n without walker in a few days with a ROM support.",

                "reply_text": "Thank you to know that you had a\nHAPPY KNEE. In the view of negative feedback given by one of my patients parent two months back, I wish to discuss about MONEY AND ETHICS IN MEDICAL PRACTICE. And DETERIORATING OPINION ON DOCTORS.\nI see an average 30-40patients a day which around 6000/year. If 8 out of 6000 give me a negative feedback, I don\u2019t worry as mostly are about delays in clinic which are beyond my control during an emergency case. But even if one patient comments about about my MEDICAL ETHICS, that hurts me and make me look into my inner conscious and question myself \u201cam I the unethical person the lady is taking about.\u201d \nI will give an example of how PATIENTS INTERPRET DECISION MAKING.\nI saw a 12year old child with knee dislocation. Scan shows ligament tear which needs surgery. If you go for a second opinion, there is very fair chance the doctor won\u2019t agree with surgical decision as we know that most patients coming second opinion don\u2019t want surgery at that point. Does this mean that first date is unethical ? Of course I see on a daily basis where surgery was wrongly suggested when there is absolutely no indication. \nKNEE LIGAMENT INJURIES NEED SURGERY NOT TO IMPROVE PAIN, but to prevent any instability in future which when untreated leads to arthritis in joint over 5years. So if you treat a ACL TEAR  patient without surgery, he will walk again in properly in few weeks. That doesn\u2019t mean surgery is not required at all.  Most  people slowly damage the joint because of knee jerking with every step and worse with running or playing sports. How do I make patient understand the long term issues. \nI operate some knee ligament injuries immediately after injury and some even 4-5 years after the ligament tear. The difference between those two cases  is the damage done to joint in patients who have delayed surgery. \nSo QUESTIONING ETHICALITY OF A GOOD DOCTOR IS WRONG.  We study close to 30years to understand the intricacies in decision making. How can a person judge a doctor  based on information gathered in few minutes from google or from another doctor ? \nPlease question yourself, before posting demoralising statements.",

He explained  everything for all my questions (some very silly questions as well), and got confidence after meeting and talking to him.  My observations are - he is very patient, friendly and care for patients.  \n\nAfter all the  pre-tests and formalities and insurance approvals, I got my surgery done on  22nd Apr 2019.  I was able to walk with the support of walker immediately the next day and discharged on the same day. Met the doctor again on 10 May 2019 for stitches removal.  I went to meet Dr for consultation by walking with knee brace support from hospital entrance. \nI started walking without walker and brace immediately after few days from then. For Physiotherapy I used the 3rd party services initaially. When I met next time after a month for consultation, he is not happy with the progress and suggested me to take help from the Physio who works for him and gave his improvement suggestions to Physio.\nNext time when i met after 2 months, The doctor was very happy upon seeing my progress. Its almost 9 months since surgrey done and didnt face any issues. \n\nVenkat who is support staff, was very helpful for all the appointments and scheduling my surgery. Rohit, Phsio, did my physiotherapy and helped me to recover fast!\n\nI strongly suggest Dr. Prabhat for all ACL surgeries and consultation!\n\nThank you Dr!\nRajesh ",

My first option was to visit Dr Prabhat as I was taking my mom der for back pain. Once I reached the hospital doctor just checked my knee movement and told that it could be a ligament tear and for the confirmation I was asked to go for MRI and in MRI it was diagnosed to be complete ACL tear. Prabhat told me that for ACL complete tear there is no option than to go for surgery. Venkat who assists Prabhat has taken the required insurance details and completed the formalities for cashless treatment within a day. Doctor gives such a confidence that you never feel that you are going to have surgery. He explained me in detail about the procedure and I was happy that I came to right person for treatment. surgery was done on 15th June 2017 and was about to stand on the next day itself. Even after the surgery the following day doctor his junior  Kundan and Venkat have visited me to check the status . It's good to see them so concerned about a patient. Today I have gone there to remove the staples and it always done in a minute without pain. Doctor and his team which includes Venkat karuna Kundan Shekar all of them are very friendly and you never feel that you are a patient over there. Every visit there will be like you are going to meet your buddies and have a casual talk. And one more thing there will always be a new motivational quote in the doctor's room. To quote one \"If you can't handle stress you can't handle success\". Thank you Prabhat and team and I am confident that I will play more cricket even after ACL tear but after an year.",

There he immediately recognised that I had developed CRPS in my foot as a result of the improper treatment I had received at Sunshine Hospital. CRPS is a very painful and a rare disease only a very few skilled doctors could diagnose and treat, and Dr. Prabhath Reddy is one of them. He actively listens to your problems and prescribes the right treatment. He is very friendly and ** *** **** ********* ** *** ****** His diagnostic skills are truly amazing. I was in a great amount of pain when I first met him. But after his treatment my pain has significantly decreased and now I am able to walk a lot without any assistance.

Due to sudden twist of leg between road and bike, ACL tear happened. After reading through many positive reviews on Practo, I visited Apollo hospital Jubilee hills and consulted Dr. Prabhat Reddy sir for treatment. Being an experienced orthopaedics, he was able to quickly suggest the next steps for my scenario. My injury was complex in nature because of  meniscus tear and minor LCL tear as well along with complete ACL tear. Before visiting Prabhat Reddy sir, I had many doubts about my recovery due complex nature of ligament tears in knee but after consulting him, all my doubts were cleared and gave confidence that I can recover and walk again normally in 8-12 weeks. He clearly explained which ligaments will be treated during the arthroscopic surgery and which will be healed automatically. I am writing this review after 2 months, I am able walk normally (99%) now, And I am confident that by the completion of  3 months everything will be normal. Sir has group of talented physiotherapists, who does physio sessions at home as per our convenience. they follow the week-by-week guidelines set by Prabhat Reddy sir and make sure you are on track for full recovery. Overall, I had a very good treatment from Dr. Prabhat Reddy sir and his physio team. Thanks you sir for helping me recover from injury quickly.",

I live in the United States and the injury first occurred while playing volleyball and later dislocated on several occasions while swimming, basketball, cricket etc. totaling to about 6 painful dislocations. This is common in Athletes wherein a few tend to put the shoulder back into position without pain, but for me, I am well built at 6ft/ 85kgs and when the shoulder dislocates the whole body is like locked and the only position of the body is to kneel and lay my arm on the ground. The body in an uncomfortable position and the pain is immense.\n\nOn my visit to India, I've searched the web and found Dr. Lakkireddi on Practo. He was my first choice but was hesitant to visit him because of where he practiced. (Don't ask me why). I had seen a couple of Doctors before I visited Dr Lakkireddi but finally opted purely based off the reviews on Practo and this time followed my gut and gave it a shot. I was very impressed on the first visit for the reason, he speaks to you as someone you've know for a while and him just being more than a Doctor. Most Doctors explain the issue and the treatment needed which to me is common, but its the confidence that Doctor creates in the patient who needs to get treated moreover a surgery. I've been in pain for more than 2yrs and did not want to go under the knife for the wrong reasons. \n\nI had planned for a surgery earlier at another hospital, had my MRI reports/ blood work done but backed off due to bad experience just 1 hour before the surgery. Dr. Lakkireddi used the same reports and blood work to diagnose and I decided to go for the surgery without a second thought. It all happened in 10-15min and that's the confidence he created in me as a Doctor that you don't see anymore or rarely. \n\nI am proud that I made my decision and thanks to Dr. Lakkireddi and his office assistant Venkat, Dr Shekar Reddy (Anesthesia) and his other team members (Sorry I don't recall the names) for helping me out. The surgery was a bit complex than expected as I might have damaged due to multiple dislocations. Its been 4 months that I had the surgery and I am recovering well. I had done a lot of research online on the Bankart Repair before the surgery and being sports person and its easy for me to do a rehab and adopt to physiotherapy. I've visited Dr Lakkireddi a couple of times after the surgery but never got a chance to interact on the Physiotherapy as I had to leave back to the U.S. I am working on my own and have a full movement but will go for muscle strengthening over the next few months and I shall see Dr. Lakkireddi on my next visit to India. \n\nRegards,\nVamsee Mopuru",

I would like explain in detail about what happened and how Dr..Prabhath sir was helpful, sorry for the detailed feedback and hope this helps patients with similar problem.\n\nBackground: I was frequently twisting my ankle from last three years, I visited some orthopedic doctors in Chennai (I was staying in Chennai at that time and later moved to Hyderabad) and I didn't find them helpful and neither they understood my problem. I visited Dr.Prabhath in February when I again badly injured my ankle while playing Cricket and on my first visit Dr told me there is some problem with one of my Ligament called ATFL and suggested to take rest and after a month of taking some tablets suggested a CT Scan. In the scan it is confirmed that my ATFL ligament got tored and it requires surgery to reconstruct.I took other doctors opinion in Hyderabad and they also said  the same about surgery.\n\nProcess: I got my ATFL ligament  reconstructed with internal Brace in June 2018 with Dr Prabhath and  it's been close to 6months and I started jogging with no pain and as of now my ankle looks stable.I would say recovery is very good with very less medication and I appreciate how all this process went through with Dr.Prabhat sir.\n\nFor the following reasons I would suggest Dr.Prabhath Lakireddy.\n1. Detailed explanation of the problem. Dr.Prabhath explained me what happened to mmy ankle and what should be done and what happens if we don't go for it's repair.\n2. Time he spends with patients and having lot of patience in answering our doubts and questions.\n3. Before the surgery he told me the procedure name and even told me to check in Google for some details and at the same time asked me not to go for too much details which might confuse.\n4. Surgery went very well and I was discharged next day with an advise of rest for 2 months and a total rest for 6 months. I was suggested Calcium supplements for 3 months and pain killers for two weeks. Very less medication or no unnecessary medications.\n5. No physiotherapy suggested. He told few excersices to do everyday and it helped a lot.\n6. Avoids unnecessary lab tests and he asks every time if we can afford scan or not which is very rare.\n\nI am very happy with Dr.Prabhat Lakireddy *** ** ** *** ** *** **** ******* ** ****** A big thank you sir !!!!!\n\nPavan Kumar Ambati,\nHyderabad.\n",

I see a significant change in the trust patient have on me now than five years back. \nInitial years when I recommended surgery, quite a few of my patients used to go for second opinion to another doctor. \nI have seen a gradual built of trust in my recommendation and quality of care has improved significantly. \nNow I see more than 50% patients coming to me for second opinion. More than 90% trust me and go with my recommendation of NO OPERATION OR OPERATION LIKE ARTHROSCOPY OR JOINT REPLACEMENT.\nIt is very sad to see that the trust patients have on doctors is going down over years. When I look at patients coming for second opinion, more than half of them did not actual need surgery. \nI wonder why any doctor should choose that path. I believe in FIRST WIN THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE OF PATIENT, THEY WILL ALWAYS COME FOR YOU AND TAKE YOUR WORD\". \nI can't change the world, but I will follow what I believe in- \"HAPPY PATIENTS-HAPPY DOCTORS\".\nThank you for inspiring me to write.",

Then I went through practo and found that he is the top orthopedist in Hyderabad based on the reviews. So I thought I would consult him for the second opinion. After talking to him, I have decided that I will get the surgery done by him. Yes, the reviews are helped to meet the **** doctor.. So  writing this review so it would be helpful for somebody like me.. Unlike other online products the reviews of a doctor should be genuine as we keep our life in their hands.\n                                                             \nHere are few points from my experience why I would recommend this doctor..\n1.He is very patient and friendly.. Always smiling.. The point is we can express our problems or ask doubts without any hesitation\n2.Unlike other doctors, he explains the internal details of the surgery which builds the confidence in us and clears all confusions..\n3.He had decided a date for surgery.. but we had not get the insurance approval and there was no proper intimation from insurance billing team.. I was in a confusion whether to be on fast as that was the day of surgery.. Doctor himself called me in the morning and told me to be on fast and will do the surgery in the afternoon.. I felt very happy.. Yes, he cares for his patients..\n                                                       \nWhile coming to the staff, Venkat and Karuna are very supportive..

Was able to walk with the support of walker immediately the next day.. Met the doctor again on 15th March 2017, I went on wheel chair to the doctor's consultation room.. He told(funnily) that he would charge me for the wheel chair if I come next time and told that I do not need to use walker or any brace.. I started walking without walker and brace immediately after two days from then.. Then next time, i.e on 1st April 2017 I went to him alone without any support for walking.. The doctor was very happy upon seeing my progress.. obviously I was the happiest too..\n                                                              \nThank you sir for your help and support.",

I had heard about Prabhat sir from a colleague of mine and visited. The doc had recommended to get a couple of tests done part which he had recommended me to get a meniscus surgery done for a permanent fix. The doc never hurried and tried to give me more time, explained the crux of the issue and even sent me a few videos for me to understand and mentally prepare myself. He was extremely professional during surgery right from his patience in explaining the issue in detail both to family and me before surgery n after surgery to his care for his patients makes him stand out. While it was supposed to be a meniscus surgery once he started the scopy and realized that my ACL was damaged as well, explained the issue to my family showed photos and took their consent to fix that as well since it was the root cause of the meniscus injury n a better permanent fix. I really liked his honesty here as he could have simple gone ahead with meniscus repair as planned but his genuine intent of fixing the knee for good and suggesting whats the right thing to do for patients is appreciable. The time he gives to patients even during appointments is noteworthy. If you are looking for an ortho look no further. He has a really good support team as well Venkat who manages appointments n paperwork, Krishna one of the physio under him are very professional and good at what they do. Thanks Prabhat sir n team for a successful surgery I was able to walk with a walker the next day after surgery n without walker in a few days with a ROM support.",

In the view of negative feedback given by one of my patients parent two months back, I wish to discuss about MONEY AND ETHICS IN MEDICAL PRACTICE. And DETERIORATING OPINION ON DOCTORS.\nI see an average 30-40patients a day which around 6000/year. If 8 out of 6000 give me a negative feedback, I don\u2019t worry as mostly are about delays in clinic which are beyond my control during an emergency case. But even if one patient comments about about my MEDICAL ETHICS, that hurts me and make me look into my inner conscious and question myself \u201cam I the unethical person the lady is taking about.\u201d \nI will give an example of how PATIENTS INTERPRET DECISION MAKING.\nI saw a 12year old child with knee dislocation. Scan shows ligament tear which needs surgery. If you go for a second opinion, there is very fair chance the doctor won\u2019t agree with surgical decision as we know that most patients coming second opinion don\u2019t want surgery at that point. Does this mean that first date is unethical ? Of course I see on a daily basis where surgery was wrongly suggested when there is absolutely no indication. \nKNEE LIGAMENT INJURIES NEED SURGERY NOT TO IMPROVE PAIN, but to prevent any instability in future which when untreated leads to arthritis in joint over 5years. So if you treat a ACL TEAR  patient without surgery, he will walk again in properly in few weeks. That doesn\u2019t mean surgery is not required at all.  Most  people slowly damage the joint because of knee jerking with every step and worse with running or playing sports. How do I make patient understand the long term issues. \nI operate some knee ligament injuries immediately after injury and some even 4-5 years after the ligament tear. The difference between those two cases  is the damage done to joint in patients who have delayed surgery. \nSo QUESTIONING ETHICALITY OF A GOOD DOCTOR IS WRONG.  We study close to 30years to understand the intricacies in decision making. How can a person judge a doctor  based on information gathered in few minutes from google or from another doctor ? \nPlease question yourself, before posting demoralising statements.",

My first option was to visit Dr Prabhat as I was taking my mom der for back pain. Once I reached the hospital doctor just checked my knee movement and told that it could be a ligament tear and for the confirmation I was asked to go for MRI and in MRI it was diagnosed to be complete ACL tear. Prabhat told me that for ACL complete tear there is no option than to go for surgery. Venkat who assists Prabhat has taken the required insurance details and completed the formalities for cashless treatment within a day. Doctor gives such a confidence that you never feel that you are going to have surgery. He explained me in detail about the procedure and I was happy that I came to right person for treatment. surgery was done on 15th June 2017 and was about to stand on the next day itself. Even after the surgery the following day doctor his junior  Kundan and Venkat have visited me to check the status . It's good to see them so concerned about a patient. Today I have gone there to remove the staples and it always done in a minute without pain. Doctor and his team which includes Venkat karuna Kundan Shekar all of them are very friendly and you never feel that you are a patient over there. Every visit there will be like you are going to meet your buddies and have a casual talk. And one more thing there will always be a new motivational quote in the doctor's room. To quote one \"If you can't handle stress you can't handle success\". Thank you Prabhat and team and I am confident that I will play more cricket even after ACL tear but after an year.",

There I received improper treatment and even after 6 weeks I had a lot of pain. Then I went to Dr. Prabhath Reddy in Apollo hospital after reading great reviews about him. There he immediately recognised that I had developed CRPS in my foot as a result of the improper treatment I had received at Sunshine Hospital. CRPS is a very painful and a rare disease only a very few skilled doctors could diagnose and treat, and Dr. Prabhath Reddy is one of them. He actively listens to your problems and prescribes the right treatment. He is very friendly and ** *** **** ********* ** *** ****** His diagnostic skills are truly amazing. I was in a great amount of pain when I first met him. But after his treatment my pain has significantly decreased and now I am able to walk a lot without any assistance. I am really happy with his treatment and I always curse myself for not coming to him in the first place.For any orthopaedic issue I sincerely recommend Dr. Prabhath Reddy to anyon",

Due to sudden twist of leg between road and bike, ACL tear happened. After reading through many positive reviews on Practo, I visited Apollo hospital Jubilee hills and consulted Dr. Prabhat Reddy sir for treatment. Being an experienced orthopaedics, he was able to quickly suggest the next steps for my scenario. My injury was complex in nature because of  meniscus tear and minor LCL tear as well along with complete ACL tear. Before visiting Prabhat Reddy sir, I had many doubts about my recovery due complex nature of ligament tears in knee but after consulting him, all my doubts were cleared and gave confidence that I can recover and walk again normally in 8-12 weeks. He clearly explained which ligaments will be treated during the arthroscopic surgery and which will be healed automatically. I am writing this review after 2 months, I am able walk normally (99%) now, And I am confident that by the completion of  3 months everything will be normal. Sir has group of talented physiotherapists, who does physio sessions at home as per our convenience. they follow the week-by-week guidelines set by Prabhat Reddy sir and make sure you are on track for full recovery. Overall, I had a very good treatment from Dr. Prabhat Reddy sir and his physio team. Thanks you sir for helping me recover from injury quickly.",

So when he visited Hyderabad we discussed with Dr B.G Ratnam and he suggested Prabhat sir's name. After the consultation with the doctor we were satisfied and for the first time my father-in-law thought that his treatment was going in right direction. Prabhat sir will take enough time to explain you the root cause and what you have to do next. My father-in-law went through knee replacement surgery on 5th\u00a0May 2019 . And he was able to walk with support after 2 days. I am very happy to say that my father-in-law now recovered fully and able to do all the activities as before. We really recommend you to consult Dr. Prabhat Reddy Lakireddy if you have any pain or discomfort in musculoskeletal system (the bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, and muscles). We are sure that you will get correct consultation and remedy from him. We are really thankful to Dr.Prabhat Reddy Lakireddy and his subordinates.",

I have visited him, he gave me the detailed information about the injury and surgery which made me more confident and eliminated all the confusions regarding injury and surgery. After surgery the very next day itself I was able to walk with the help of walker. Rehabilitation process was going smooth but worried about the extension as I was not able to extend my leg properly till 2nd week post surgery. So decided to go for physiotherapy instead of doing myself in home with my parents help. It's been 3 months after surgery now, got full extension and almost 130 deg flexion.

When I insisted I need to check the auspicious date  he asked his assistant to get the diary that has calendar and suggested to go for a date next two days. After I still insisted that I have to go home and take decision then he asked me if I hold the insurance for my daughter. When I said yes she has 3 Lakh then immediately he said it is going to cost 2.7 lakh and suggested to talk to the insurance company and appraise the insurance amount by paying additional premium. So, that my family will be managing the risk as recently it was renewed and we can survive for another 11 months. I somehow said yes as I wanted to get out. But again he asked his assistant to accompany me to resister with the insurance company on the incident. When I came out of the consultation room and asked the helper to drop me at exit for then he said I cannot go out as the assistant doctor asked him to wait. Then they tried taking me and my daughter who is in the wheel chair to register the incident with the insurance company, I lost the patience and shouted on them to leave me. The assistant doctor called somebody and then he asked the helper to drop me at exit. ************ ** ******** ** **** ** **** ******* *** ******* ***** ********** **** ***** I was not encouraged for going surgery as my daughter is just 12 years old.",

It was tough for me to go the gym or play any sports. \n\nAfter seeing the positive reviews for the Doctor on Practo, I have decided to find a permanent solution to my problem. The doctor explained the problem clearly and put forward the circumstances I would have to if I do not get the operation performed. The doctor also clearly explained the surgical procedure, which I found was much more advanced compared to the procedures of the other doctors I have consulted.\n\nPost operation, good care was taken in the hospital. The physiotherapist from the hospital was very knowledgable and ensured quick recovery. I was able to walk with the help of a walker within a day, a stick within a week and without any support within 2 weeks. The artificial ligament which the doctor has used for the operation ruled out any initial hiccups as it provided stability from Day 1. \n\nThe doctor is easily available and we have kept a constant connect post operation reviewing the progress every 2 weeks. For the meniscus tear, the doctor suggested another advanced technique where blood platelets were extracted and then injected into the knee. This allowed the Meniscus to regrow as it was only a partial tear.\n\n3 months post the operation I was instructed to starting jogging and perform some basic gym exercises. It has been 6 months now and I am able to run without any problem. All the problems regarding instability which I used to encounter before have not been experienced after the re construction.",

Diagnose the condition\n2. Given them treatment options\n3. If surgery is the best option, then I wait for patient to ask me how much it cost for surgery\n4. Only after patient understands surgery will help, then we ask them if they have pay for their treatment or insurance. \nUnder no circumstance either me or my junior consultants or my staff should enquire about insurance. \nIf I reach a stage where money will drive me, then I think I will certainly consider looking another job. I always believed and taught my juniors,\u201d do the best for your patients, money will come\u201d, in a span of 40years of medical practice , we all can make decent money, but that shouldn\u2019t be the driving force. I was seeing the negative feedback after 2months, so I thought I should clarify on money and ethics.\nThank you",

I got my doubts clear. root cause identified.. and to-do actions are also prescribed in friendly way.  both the times I felt a sense of satisfaction. hence even though I was waiting almost 30 mins to visit him. but in the end it's worth of waiting. At least I know there is a huge demand for his experience and as well as expertise. I will definitely recommend to consult with Dr. Lakkireddy if you are having Ortho issues.",

Even when we plan for a holiday we always do risk/benefit analysis, obviously we don't go on holidays to conflict zones though it might have the best places to see. The first question is pose to ourselves is \"is the place nice? (benefit)\" and then the next question is \"is the place safe?(risk).When we take a consent for surgery, we explain RISKS AND BENEFITS.

The professionalism and attention to detail by the Doctor has amazed me. I felt like I was the only patient he had because of the unique focus he gives to everything I say. I no longer feel sick - just a challenge with my knee. This continues to be a great experience and I look forward to writing my own chronicles of a Kenyan Lady's experience in Hyberdad. A Doctor who has gone beyond his call of duty and taken health care to a whole new level of excellence. ",

Dr Prabhat is highly professional & very friendly and makes patient at ease. Explains in details about the problem, the remedy and limitations very clearly.

I was suggested that Arthroscopy as a corrective procedure. Doctor gave a clear explanation about the surgery, the recovery period and prepared me well for the surgery. The surgery is not particularly major and I got discharged the very next day. There was severe restriction on the movement of the shoulder for around 4 weeks. The procedure required physiotherapy for 3-4 weeks after that. The dislocation problem has not re-surfaced since then. There was some drop in the strength of the shoulder, but the doctor has suggested useful exercises and movements which are slowly helping me to gain the strength back.\n\nOverall, it was a very positive experience with the doctor and I am glad to have gone through the surgery even though the complete recovery time is a bit on the high side.",

I couldn\u2019t stand more than 5mins. Dr. Lakkireddy suggested me to take ESWT, Extracorporeal Shock wave therapy. It worked like a magic for me. I took only two sessions. However, I am not limping anymore. I can walk like before the accident. It helps in wound healing, tissue regeneration and bone remodeling. Thanks to Dr. Prabhat Reddi for his valuable suggestions and for his care and making me feel better. You are truly an astounding doctor and professional that I respect and trust. ",

Something\u2019s are not in my control. FOR FUTURE REFERENCE FOR ALL, PLEASE CHECK WITH MY SECRETARY ABOUT THE PROPER ADDRESS OF HOSPITAL AND ABOUT MY AVAILABILITY BEFORE YOU START TO HOSPITAL. \nSecondly there are some patients who are really worried about the vague symptoms like leg pain or multi joint pains and have visited severe doctors and no one has treated there symptoms. After evaluating them, if I don\u2019t think there is big issue, I don\u2019t offer any different treatment than previous doctors and these are the ones who talk bad about doctors. My policy is simple, either I can treat someone or can\u2019t treat, there is no vague treatment.",

You can find all these qualities in Prabhat Sir. He gave me lot of time where he answered all of my questions with a smile. He explained everything clearly. Am 31 years old. Since 4 years I was suffering from knee pain. Visited few doctors they didn't explain my problem clearly. Visited other dr he suggested to have a arthroscopic surgery for both the knees but still my issue was not properly addressed. When I was collecting my mri reports I came to know about Prabhat Sir. So finally wanted to give a last try. I have just shown all my reports. He clearly explained me wts my issue. I have a problem with my meniscus in both the knees. Due to that am suffering from patello femoral joint osteoarthritis (pfjoa) in my right knee. He said a word don't worry as of now no need of surgery we will start the treatment which could solve your problem. Thank you Sir for your patience friendly behavior and suggestions ",

As a normal check, I visited Dr. Prabhat Lakkireddi sir for a second opinion as I felt the first opinion was not so useful or rather, effective. He normally asked me for the symptoms, followed by an examination of the affected area and immediately diagnosed me with a full ACL tear. I was surprised to see that the MRI report showed the same which he understood immediately after an initial checkup. He suggested for a reconstruction surgery which I underwent in May. Dr. Prabhat Lakkireddi sir operated on me for the reconstruction. Later, for getting the stitches off of my body, I visited him after two weeks. It's being 7 months since I underwent the  surgery and I feel no pain at the affected area and I am extremely satisfied with his diagnosis and expertise in the surgery department. I will definitely refer Dr. Prabhat Lakkireddi sir to anyone who asks me for reference in the area of Orthopaedics. Thank you Dr. Prabhat Lakkireddi sir for relieving me of the pain so quickly and effectively.",

Treatment for pregnant women has to be only physiotherapy and least minimal medications till she delivers. Clinical assessment is more important than your MRI to diagnose the problem. MRI is only to confirm, that's the reason why I said review and repeat MRI after deliver. \nSome days I get EMERGENCIES which take priority over out patients which will delay my clinic. Frankly speaking it takes more time trying to explain patients when the clinic is running late. Professionals should understand that we don't work like clock. Giving the best possible advice to every single patient is my priority. I hope anyone who is reading the feedback understand the role of doctor. Thank you dr LAKKIREDDI",

It has been taken almost 2 hours to meet the doctor. One positive  thing is he is a good listener about the patient problem.  My self only met the doctor  and briefly  explain the problem.  I have shown the past MRI reports.  It is unfortunate  that doctor  said with out going through  the past MRI he suggested  for one more time MRI and suggested  Visit once again  after  delivery.  I came with out any specific  suggestion and paid Rs 700/-. It is a humble request  that the concern is to take care the almost importance to the patient.  \nThanks \nRegards \nKanthi Kiran \nDy.Manager \nBHEL VIJAYAWADA site ",

He explained the entire case , and walked us through the MRI report. He suggested medication with some options like (if this does not work , try this) , which is a good thing. Because already the patient had gone through so many medications. Finally he gave an option for arthroscopy , explained its procedure and cost. \nN.B : Practo has a small issue showing the address.

We got admitted for surgery. Dr.Prabhat showed great care, and concern about us (more so around this chaotic pandemic situation), and ensured we are well informed during every phase of the surgery. The specific operating procedure used (Micro-endo discectomy) was by orders less painful than Micro Discectomy that I had undergone a couple of years back in another premium Corporate hospital, for a similar problem. He promptly followed up and reviewed my post-surgery situation. My recovery has been quite +ve so far, and sincere thanks to Dr.Prabhat for being a great doctor.",

Checked my previous records and then asked me to get an MRI. After looking at my MRI he gave medication and advised to me perform physiotherapy. Medication was not heavy, just 2-3 tablets a day. I recovered in around 20-25 days, my pain got reduced. After one month I visited him for a review and he talked very patiently with me and explained me how I should change my lifestyle to avoid such issues in future. I strongly recommend Doctor Prabhat garu. Even though being a senior and famous doctor he is very humble and down to earth.",

I was at the venue before my scheduled time and was informed that the doctor is running late by 45mins. I patiently waited and was positive about the meeting (even though I was getting late for work) as I was really impressed by previous reviews. And then I was asked to wait for 15 more minutes and later again another 15 minutes. So after waiting for more than 1hr 15mins, I came back. The receptionists seemed equally misinformed and were of no help. It was a rather unprofessional behaviour from whosoever stands responsible for and hopefully booking slots are made available as per doctor's availablity in future. Prior information must be passed to patient in case of any changes in schedule. ",

This time the doctor as well as his assistants were very helpful from helping me out with insurance and all other related things. I know that these reviews will be useful because they were very much useful for me. The surgeon who keeps practicing and is enlightened about the latest technologies is more important and Dr. Prabhat Lakkireddi is the one who does it. In few words just give it a try and i am sure you will not regret it.",

I had made two observations.\nFirstly, As I always say, I get emergencies, and emergencies don\u2019t come with an appointment. They need immediate attention, and so the priorities change. Something\u2019s are not in my control. FOR FUTURE REFERENCE FOR ALL, PLEASE CHECK WITH MY SECRETARY ABOUT THE PROPER ADDRESS OF HOSPITAL AND ABOUT MY AVAILABILITY BEFORE YOU START TO HOSPITAL. \nSecondly there are some patients who are really worried about the vague symptoms like leg pain or multi joint pains and have visited severe doctors and no one has treated there symptoms. After evaluating them, if I don\u2019t think there is big issue, I don\u2019t offer any different treatment than previous doctors and these are the ones who talk bad about doctors. My policy is simple, either I can treat someone or can\u2019t treat, there is no vague treatment.",

In all inside there are no screws, so faster recovery. \nLast two year, we added \"ACL INTERNAL AUGMENTATION OR INTERNAL BRACING to ALL INSIDE ACL RECONTRUCTION\" which has virtually eliminated failures like RE RUPTURE, GRAFT LOOSENING. \nWith this advanced technique, we trialing to see if patients can RETURN TO SPORTS IN 4 MONTHS, rather than traditional 9-12months. Ther are more SPORTS PEOPLE FROM \"GOPICHAND ACADEMY AND HYDERBAD RUNNERS' who are doing far better with this latest technique compared to other techniques. \nAll these procedures are technically demanding and need good expertise.",

The NEW AREA OF ORTHOPAEDIC TREATMENT IS \"REGENERATIVE- REGENERATION MEANS USING HUMAN BODY'S INHERENT POTENTIAL TO HEAL IT SELF\".\n\"LAKKI SCOPE\" REGEN ORTHO SPORTS MEAN:\n1. PRP: PLATELET RICH PLASMA- eg- when we have a cut our skin, it heals competely even without any medications. this fantastic healing potential is because of PLATELETS. we use the same principle to treat joint problems in knee & shoulder like osteoarthritis, partial meniscal tear, partial ACL tear, partial rotator cuff tear.\n2. BMAC: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE CONCENTRATE- \nSIMILAR TO PRP BUT MORE EFFECTIVE AS IT has bone marrow derived STEM CELLS WHICH CAN REPAIR ANY TISSUE. \nBMAC HAS A SPECIAL ROLE IN KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS AND A DREADFUL CONDITION CALLED AVASCULAR NECROSIS OF HIP. bmac can prevent progression to hip replacement\n3. REGROW- CHONDRON, OSSGROW: \nThe BEST TREATMENT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE LESS THAN 50 YEARS OLD WITH CARTILAGE DAMAGE OF KNEE, AVASCULAR NECROSIS OF HIP. what our body can't repair, we grow cartilage or bone cells outside in a lab and implant in the damaged area. SO FAR IT HAS FANTASTIC RESULTS AND THE ONLY REGENERATIVE TREATMENT IN THE WORLD WHICH HAS GOVERNMENT APPROVAL. \nthere is growing evidence that these are the FUTURE TREATMENTS WHICH WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SURGERY.",

Something\u2019s are not in my control. FOR FUTURE REFERENCE FOR ALL, PLEASE CHECK WITH MY SECRETARY ABOUT THE PROPER ADDRESS OF HOSPITAL AND ABOUT MY AVAILABILITY BEFORE YOU START TO HOSPITAL. \nSecondly there are some patients who are really worried about the vague symptoms like leg pain or multi joint pains and have visited severe doctors and no one has treated there symptoms. After evaluating them, if I don\u2019t think there is big issue, I don\u2019t offer any different treatment than previous doctors and these are the ones who talk bad about doctors. My policy is simple, either I can treat someone or can\u2019t treat, there is no vague treatment.",

Most times gold standard knee implants give same results as expensive ones.\n2. knee replacement is life time surgery. Don't get trapped by getting it done by some one who does ten a day. a good knee surgery takes an hour to operate, and it is physically not possible for a single surgeon to do a more than four GOOD QUALITY SURGERIES IN A DAY. IN UK YOU COME UNDER SCRUTINY IF YOU ARE OPERATING MORE THAN FIVE KNEE REPLACEMENTS A DAY, AS EVIDENCE HAD SHOWN THAT THEY HAVE POOR RESULTS WITH HIGH FAILURES.\n3. EVERY ONE OF US ARE UNIQUE, DONT COMPARE WITH ANOTHER PATIENT. Even in my own patients who under went BOTH KNEE REPLACEMENT, one knee recovers faster than other knee. SO DONT COMPARE, DON'T SET A HARD TARGET FOR RECOVERY. \"REMEMBER THAT YOUR KNEE REPLACEMENT IS ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND SHOULD LAST YOUR LIFE TIME HOPEFULLY.",
