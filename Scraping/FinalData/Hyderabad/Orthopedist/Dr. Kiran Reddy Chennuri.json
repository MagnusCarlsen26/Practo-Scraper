From the moment I stepped into Kindle, I knew I was in good hands. \n\nDr. Kiran Reddy and his team recommended using my own hamstring graft for the surgery, which I felt was a personalized approach to my treatment. The surgery was successful, and I was impressed by the level of care provided by the entire medical staff.\n\nThe post-operative physiotherapy and rehabilitation program offered by Kindle were instrumental in my recovery. While it was initially challenging, the physiotherapy team was highly skilled, encouraging, and motivating. They helped me regain strength, flexibility, and stability in my knee. \n\nWithin just one week after surgery, I started seeing significant improvements. The pain reduced, and I regained confidence in my knee's functionality. The dedication and expertise of the physiotherapy team played a crucial role in my successful recovery.\n\nI am incredibly grateful to Dr. Kiran Reddy and the entire team at Kindle for their excellent care and support throughout my journey. Thanks to their efforts, I am now able to return to my workouts with confidence, knowing that I have received top-notch treatment and care.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Kiran Reddy Chennuri and Kindle Hospital to anyone in need of orthopedic care. Their expertise, personalized approach, and commitment to patient well-being truly set them apart.\n\nThank you once again, Dr. Kiran Reddy, and the entire team at Kindle, for helping me make a full recovery and regain my active lifestyle.\n\nSincerely,",

It's essential to clarify that medical diagnosis cannot rely solely on initial presentation; it necessitates concrete evidence, such as diagnostic imaging. \n\nThroughout my career, I've encountered numerous instances where diagnostic tools have been pivotal in identifying life-threatening conditions, from punctured lungs, and tumours to underlying infections. Unless your doctor uncle is a Kryptonian with X-ray vision, we doctors are reliant on diagnostic aids to provide accurate care. \n\nDespite this, I've meticulously demonstrated, through X-rays, the degenerative changes in bones related to menopause. It's disheartening to invest time in individuals who undervalue proper treatment, especially when countless lives have been saved through diligent and accurate diagnosis.\n\nNext time please have realistic expectations for a health care professionals or just go to a tarot card reader or a witch doctor for your diagnosis on the spot by contacting the \"spirit realm\" without an x-ray or even examining you.\n\nThank you. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

                "review_text": "I have visited Dr kiran Reddy as one of my friends recommended him as a good knee specialist. I have been having knee pain since 6 months on and off, and have consulted a lot of orthopedics who have prescribed various pain medications, blood tests and MRI scans, I have also been offered a diagnostic laproscopy procedure for finding out what was wrong with my knee. Every time I took medications the pain went away for a few days but it returned as soon I went on with life. I have lost faith in doctors and wanted to try alternative medicine like homeopathy.\n\nAfter I visited Dr Kiran Reddy, he patiently listened to all my problems and took a very detailed history of events from the beginning and including my childhood to correlate any similar events. He meticulously went through all my previous prescriptions,blood reports, x_rays and scans. He did a full body examination including my spine, foot other joints to omit all the conditions others might have missed. \n\nHe found out that I had some issue with the hip on the same side as the movements were less and the hip was tight with little pain. Apparently the new hip x_rays showed some fluid in the joint causing it to move apart. He has nailed the problem with another MRI scan of the hip. It was pain from the hip which was showing as knee pain. The explanation finally did make some meaning to me.\n\nAlthough the entire consultation took over 40 minutes to go through my old reports and scans, He also called up the concerned radiologist to discuss my MRI report. While he had patients to attend to, he gave me full attention I needed because I was running around hospitals from pillar to post till then. \n\nHe gave me options for the treatment, and explained in detail their advantages and disadvantages. He also suggested that for my stage I should be fine with non surgical treatment along with some changes in my daily routine and lifestyle. \n\nI am doing fine now. I thank the doctor for his help and support. \n",

My mother had been suffering from severe back pain for several years, and despite seeking medical help from various doctors and undergoing numerous tests, her condition only seemed to worsen with time. We were afraid that surgery might be the only option left to alleviate her pain.\n\nHowever, after consulting with Dr. Chennuri, we were relieved to discover that surgery was not necessary after all. Dr. Chennuri took a holistic approach to my mother's treatment, combining physiotherapy with medication and other non-invasive techniques to address the root cause of her pain. He was patient, attentive, and always willing to answer our questions and concerns.\n\nThanks to Dr. Chennuri's diligent efforts, my mother's back pain has significantly reduced, and she is finally able to sleep on her right side again, something she hasn't been able to do for many years. She is now living a pain-free life, and we cannot express our gratitude enough.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Chennuri to anyone looking for a compassionate and skilled medical professional who truly cares about his patients' well-being. Thank you, Dr. Chennuri, for making a positive difference in my mother's life.",

In addition to that, he also advised me on changes to my posture while sitting, exercises to strengthen my back, and tips for reducing the amount of time I spend sitting in front of the computer.The phsyiotherapist Beulah was also really helpful and was very patient with me, I felt like she did her beast in reducing my pain .\n\nI was also really impressed with the friendly and professional staff at Kindle Clinics. They made me feel at ease and were always available to answer any questions I had over the phone. I was able to avoid surgery, my back pain is now a thing of the past. However the doctor warned me that if I dont continue exercise at home the pain might come back due to weak core. \n\nRegards.",

From the moment I stepped into Kindle, I knew I was in good hands. \n\nDr. Kiran Reddy and his team recommended using my own hamstring graft for the surgery, which I felt was a personalized approach to my treatment. The surgery was successful, and I was impressed by the level of care provided by the entire medical staff.\n\nThe post-operative physiotherapy and rehabilitation program offered by Kindle were instrumental in my recovery. While it was initially challenging, the physiotherapy team was highly skilled, encouraging, and motivating. They helped me regain strength, flexibility, and stability in my knee. \n\nWithin just one week after surgery, I started seeing significant improvements. The pain reduced, and I regained confidence in my knee's functionality. The dedication and expertise of the physiotherapy team played a crucial role in my successful recovery.\n\nI am incredibly grateful to Dr. Kiran Reddy and the entire team at Kindle for their excellent care and support throughout my journey. Thanks to their efforts, I am now able to return to my workouts with confidence, knowing that I have received top-notch treatment and care.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Kiran Reddy Chennuri and Kindle Hospital to anyone in need of orthopedic care. Their expertise, personalized approach, and commitment to patient well-being truly set them apart.\n\nThank you once again, Dr. Kiran Reddy, and the entire team at Kindle, for helping me make a full recovery and regain my active lifestyle.\n\nSincerely,",

It's essential to clarify that medical diagnosis cannot rely solely on initial presentation; it necessitates concrete evidence, such as diagnostic imaging. \n\nThroughout my career, I've encountered numerous instances where diagnostic tools have been pivotal in identifying life-threatening conditions, from punctured lungs, and tumours to underlying infections. Unless your doctor uncle is a Kryptonian with X-ray vision, we doctors are reliant on diagnostic aids to provide accurate care. \n\nDespite this, I've meticulously demonstrated, through X-rays, the degenerative changes in bones related to menopause. It's disheartening to invest time in individuals who undervalue proper treatment, especially when countless lives have been saved through diligent and accurate diagnosis.\n\nNext time please have realistic expectations for a health care professionals or just go to a tarot card reader or a witch doctor for your diagnosis on the spot by contacting the \"spirit realm\" without an x-ray or even examining you.\n\nThank you. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I have been having knee pain since 6 months on and off, and have consulted a lot of orthopedics who have prescribed various pain medications, blood tests and MRI scans, I have also been offered a diagnostic laproscopy procedure for finding out what was wrong with my knee. Every time I took medications the pain went away for a few days but it returned as soon I went on with life. I have lost faith in doctors and wanted to try alternative medicine like homeopathy.\n\nAfter I visited Dr Kiran Reddy, he patiently listened to all my problems and took a very detailed history of events from the beginning and including my childhood to correlate any similar events. He meticulously went through all my previous prescriptions,blood reports, x_rays and scans. He did a full body examination including my spine, foot other joints to omit all the conditions others might have missed. \n\nHe found out that I had some issue with the hip on the same side as the movements were less and the hip was tight with little pain. Apparently the new hip x_rays showed some fluid in the joint causing it to move apart. He has nailed the problem with another MRI scan of the hip. It was pain from the hip which was showing as knee pain. The explanation finally did make some meaning to me.\n\nAlthough the entire consultation took over 40 minutes to go through my old reports and scans, He also called up the concerned radiologist to discuss my MRI report. While he had patients to attend to, he gave me full attention I needed because I was running around hospitals from pillar to post till then. \n\nHe gave me options for the treatment, and explained in detail their advantages and disadvantages. He also suggested that for my stage I should be fine with non surgical treatment along with some changes in my daily routine and lifestyle. \n\nI am doing fine now. I thank the doctor for his help and support. \n",

Our goal was to ensure a thorough assessment of your condition to identify any underlying issues contributing to your symptoms accurately.\nThe tests conducted six months ago for heavy alcohol intake, gastric issues, and colonoscopy do not directly relate to your orthopedic condition and degenerative changes. \nDismissing pain with painkillers is not our practice.

My mother had been suffering from severe back pain for several years, and despite seeking medical help from various doctors and undergoing numerous tests, her condition only seemed to worsen with time. We were afraid that surgery might be the only option left to alleviate her pain.\n\nHowever, after consulting with Dr. Chennuri, we were relieved to discover that surgery was not necessary after all. Dr. Chennuri took a holistic approach to my mother's treatment, combining physiotherapy with medication and other non-invasive techniques to address the root cause of her pain. He was patient, attentive, and always willing to answer our questions and concerns.\n\nThanks to Dr. Chennuri's diligent efforts, my mother's back pain has significantly reduced, and she is finally able to sleep on her right side again, something she hasn't been able to do for many years. She is now living a pain-free life, and we cannot express our gratitude enough.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Chennuri to anyone looking for a compassionate and skilled medical professional who truly cares about his patients' well-being. Thank you, Dr. Chennuri, for making a positive difference in my mother's life.",

The doctor provided me with an extensive approach to my treatment, including physiotherapy, medication, and lifestyle modifications. He prescribed me medication to reduce my pain, which was very effective in the fisrt few doses itself. In addition to that, he also advised me on changes to my posture while sitting, exercises to strengthen my back, and tips for reducing the amount of time I spend sitting in front of the computer.The phsyiotherapist Beulah was also really helpful and was very patient with me, I felt like she did her beast in reducing my pain .\n\nI was also really impressed with the friendly and professional staff at Kindle Clinics. They made me feel at ease and were always available to answer any questions I had over the phone. I was able to avoid surgery, my back pain is now a thing of the past. However the doctor warned me that if I dont continue exercise at home the pain might come back due to weak core. \n\nRegards.",

So, if you come with a serious injury, no stretcher is available. Lift can accommodate only 2-3 people at max.\nClinic has decent facilities with in-house X-Ray and physio room.\n\nMajor issue is attitude of staff. They don't care about you at all.\nEven if you are talking to them and asking more details, they would simply  ignore and keep on discussing among them.\nVery unprofessional staff. \n\nConsultation charges are in regular range, but other charges are HUGE.\nThey charged Rs. 1000/- for plaster removal (OMG).\n\nOverall, good experience only because of Dr Reddy. (STAFF is a big turn-down though) ",

We took the first available appointment next morning via call and reached on time to the clinic. \n\nThe whole process was extremely expedited, it just took us 20 minutes for the entire visit. From the moment we entered the clinic to seeing the doctor, getting the x ray done,  applying a splint and leaving. The entire process was so streamlined that we could rarely see in big corporate hospitals. There was no fuss, no running around billing counters, nothing intimidating. It has a nice homely feel to it, I really wish the concept of neighbourhood clinics could come back.\n\nThe doctor was very forthcoming about the fracture and the course of recovery. He said, just rest and immobilisation alone should heal the fracture and no further surgery or medication is required. I wish kindle clinics and the doctors practicing there the very best and totally recommend it to who ever is looking for their medical needs in Gachibowli and Kokapet area. \n\nRegards \n\nShipra G\n",

I had consulted multiple orthopaedics for the same but with no satisfaction. One of my apartment community members mentioned about Dr. Kiran and I consulted him . His reassuring attitude instantly won my trust and when he suggested dry needle treatment for my pain , though I was a little apprehensive I decided to go ahead with it. What I liked best was that the doctor was very honest about how much pain the treatment would cause and about the results that the treatment would give me. The procedure was a little painful , but Dr. Kiran did it with utmost care and was very skilful and professional. My pain didn\u2019t disappear magically after the treatment, As he had explained to me , and I was honestly a little worried , but now it\u2019s been 2 months since the procedure was done and I diligently followed his instructions and to my amazement the pain has now completely vanished . I am back to my weight lifting workout after 9 months and I am so happy about it . Thank you doctor!! I wish I could have come to you sooner . I highly recommend him !",

I must say I am very impressed with Dr. Kiran for his treatment, utmost care and  for being patient with his explanation. He carefully explained all the causes and reasons while showing us images, I have never seen a doctor do that before. He was spot on with the treatment and recommended X ray, medicines and physiotherapy. I have recovered 90 % and I have few more sessions of physiotherapy. He also explained about the correct posture to work from home and how to set up my workplace, he also said that most of IT employees and coming with the same complaint. He also showed my exercises to do at home everyday. I am  super grateful that he is such a patient listener, something other doctors should learn from him. \nSpecial mention to very friendly staff at Kindle Clinics, who gave me a pleasant experience and maintain the clinic so hygienically and nice. Thank you",

He even allowed me to take my mobile into the operating theatre. He said I could watch the surgery on the laparoscopy monitor if I wanted to. The entire process was indeed stress free. Also, the period after surgery was also easy, I walked almost immediately with a brace and walker.\n\nOne thing to note is Dr.Kiran Reddy insists on very rigorous physiotherapy and follow up, he asks you before taking up the surgery itself if you are willing to dedicate time and effort for good results, but after seeing my friend who got the same surgery from him and is doing well, I can totally understand why. \n\nI am grateful to the doctor and his teammates including physiotherapist, nurses and insurance handlers for making my stay a pleasant experience. \n\nLooking forward to getting back to cycling soon as I can.",

When he was falling off the steps I caught him by his hand and he dislocated a bone in his arm and he was not moving his elbow, Iwas very worried that it was a fracture. I requested in the reception area and the doctor saw me as soon as I went there despite having patients waiting for him because this was an emergency. Luckily he had a small dislocation, the doctor did one Xray to confirm there was no fracture and he put back the bone in his op room itself with out any Anesthesia. He did not even charge extra for the procedure. I could see my son instantly move his hand and elbow to take my mobile phone after it was set. He was a very pleasant and cordial person, he said `treat the mother, the baby is alright`. He made sure my son was comfortable before the setting up of bone. The whole process was smooth and effortless, i was just wondering if it would have been the same anywhere else. My entire family would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to him. ",

He actually just fell at home from the ramp but both bones in the leg have shattered into multiple pieces. On top of all this, my father was also diabetic and his sugar level was also so high. The doctor explained various treatment types to me and my father and he also told how the period after the surgery should be. He was constatly in touch with the diabetic doctor to control my dads blood sugars, finally surgery was done only after the sugars were in control. We have opted for small incision surgery with strong titanium plates, My father is doing well now, sutures were removed and the the scar is normal.  He is not supposed to put weight on that leg for 4 weeks now. The doctor also prescribed a bone forming injection that has to be given everyday at home, which is just like insulin pen type. overall the surgery and post surgery went smoothly for us thanks to dr kiran reddy he took very good care of all the aspects of health of my elderly father, he is very helpful and informative for the treatment.",

He actually identified and diagnosed with just clinical tests itself, but then I had to get an MRI scan done for insurance approval purposes. He is so friendly and I felt like I was talking to a family member rather than a doctor. He had explained everything so patiently without any rush and answered all my queries. He gave me options of various treatment choices, which I thought was good.  \n\nHe scheduled a date for surgery as I wanted over a weekend so that I could have my family to take care of me, the doctor obliged my request. He explained all the advantages and disadvantages of the surgery and how it would help me keep my knee in good condition at older age. \n\nI went ahead with the surgery and it was absolutely painless keyhole arthroscopic surgery, I could walk again in 4 hours, was discharged the very next day with minimal pain medications and knee brace. \n\nThe doctor has also charted out and gave a detailed rehabilitation program and told me what to expect and how to go about it. Most surprising thing is the physiotherapy was also directly coordinated and supervised by dr kiran reddy himself. \n\nHe is quite approachable and has always responded to my issues even if they were small ones. \n\nI highly recommend him for any knee related problems. \n\nThank you \n\n",

I am thankful to have seen Dr. Kiran for this, he examined me and gave me medications for the pains. He also educated me in how the pain has started and how it will go down. He also told me about how to initiate running again and where to run and all. I really liked his approach to the problem, it sometimes seems like he is asking too many questions but trust me it is all for understanding what I was going thru and how he can help. He has officially become our family orthopaedician. ",

Dr Reddy saved her toe by daily removing the dead cells and pus and giving good antibiotics. Now the toe is completely healed and she able to walk around in the house. He took care of all round aspects like food, exercise, sugar control and all others including foot wear with his team of doctors. We stayed in the hospital for 6 days as she was getting injections in her nerves and every day dr reddy came and did the dressing himself for a long time. I can very confidently recommend Dr Reddy for orthopaedic problems. ",

He is also in touch with the physiotherapist to assess the outcome on a day to day basis. It has been three weeks now and she is almost normal. She is doing her own work at home with out help.

He also told that if this does not work then we have to go for a steroid injection in the heel but it worked very well with out the injection itself.

I have consulted many doctors before this to get rid of the issue instead of many tests and medications the pain was recurring again and again. I saw the doc after a friends recommendation who got treatment from him previously for a different problem, he recommended because of his approach to the problem. Now the doctor gave me medicines and told me to restrict non veg and alcohol. It almost has been a month and no pain again after my second consultation. My blood tests are also normal now. I too sincerely recommend the doctor for orthopaedic related problems.\n\nI just wish the waiting time was a little less, even I took appointment the doctor was busy with other patients both the times.

After I have seen Dr Kiran Reddy, he had explained the problem in great detail with images and aminations which none of the other doctors have done. I gained confidence in the doctor as he told me how to take care of the problem and the cause of it. He has done a dry needling procedure on me to reduce the swelling, immediately the pain was 10 times more than before but then he said it would go down in 3 days gradually.

He is very receptive and he does not treat the ailment as a patients problem but rather he asked how my regular day is and how I sit at work, etc, etc... I would say he does a root cause analysis before coming to a diagnosis. He said what has to be done and how I should involve good postural habits in my work place, on his expert recommendation my firm has changed my desk and chair to a more ergonomic one.\n\nThe only downside is there is a lot of waiting involved and I had to cancel other appointments, but when I meet with the doctor I understood why, because he takes a very detailed history and documents everything. \n\nNow I am feeling better thanks to Dr Kiran Reddy.",

I had a 5th metarpal fracture on 1 Mar 2022 and had K- Wire cross fixation done on 2 Mar 2022 in AIG Hospital with a Different Orthopaedic Surgeon. As it is really difficult to catch the doctor who has done the surgery, I have decided to consult Dr Kiran Reddy at Kindle Clinics by reading very good reviews in practo.  Dr. Kiran diagnosed the root cause for the pain by prescribing few x-ray samples and few blood tests. He informed that I have a muscle loss in certain parts of the hand and due to the pop plaster the had got jammed with the lack of mobility. Also, he informed that i have a de quervain's tenosynovitis near right thumb. He suggested non invasive rigorous physiotherapy for 7 days and few medications and today i have completed the physiotherapy and the wrist and hand mobility improved a lot.  I liked the doctor way of diagnosis, identifying the root cause, patience, his non invasive methods, suggests only required treatments and avoids unnecessary panicking the patients etc. I would like to recommend the doctor for every one who are suffering with any orthopaedic disorders. Definitely you can trust the practo reviews regarding this doctor. ",

MRI showed complete ACL tear but actually, as per the doctor, only one of the two bundles were torn in the knee. He did a partial ACL reconstruction surgery using my hamstring tendons as a graft at Sunshine hospital in Gachibowli. Had a very pleasant experience, the pain was managed well and I have been discharged in a day. Have already started physiotherapy and could independently go to the washroom with the help of a walker. Initially, I had a lot of apprehensions regarding the surgery as I spoke to some other people who had it done previously, it was nothing like that. The doctor had provided great clarity and explained in detail what I would go thru in each phase of recovery and it has been extremely helpful. He puts a lot of emphasis on physiotherapy and rehabilitation and made sure I stick to the regimen. I thank the staff at Kindle clinics and the anesthesiologist and nursing staff at Sunshine hospital for taking such good care and lastly, I would like to immensely thank the physiotherapist for taking great care and being very patient with my recovery. \n\nOne place there is room for improvement in the discharge process, it almost took 6 hours from the moment the doctor has signed off my discharge to get insurance approvals and finally leave the hospital.",

You had an excellent result without any complications. I wish there was at least an ounce of honesty in the review. Let me elaborate:                                                                                                                              \n1. Your cumulative bill was 1,877(Co400+Pr500+Ph977), not 5k (proof attached). \n                                                                                                                                                2. X-ray is required after one month to asses the position of fracture healing.         \n                                                                                                                                                4. Medications are available in all Apollo and Med Plus pharmacy chains.                  \n                                                                                                                                                \n3. Followup holds good for a stipulated time not indefinitely, varying from clinic to clinic.                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                                 \nIf you can refute any of this, I would gladly oblige.                                                      \n                                                                                                                                              \nSo, if I infer correctly, you are satisfied with the treatment and happy with the doctor as long as they cater to your whims of health care. If not, then all of a sudden the doctor is evil?                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                                                  I understand that you aim to defame, malignin the doctor by spreading misinformation and a digital platform is the easiest to do so. I frankly don't need any patients who do not respect the profession and spoil the decorum of a health care centre. Thankfully, I do have several loyal patients who vouch for me online and offline, who are key to my successful practice.                                                     \n                                                                                                                                             \nP.S: You said that I have put a small tape on the broken finger, actually, it is a medical procedure called buddy strapping which was done under anaesthesia and one has to be well versed with the human anatomy to properly perform without any complications. Your flawless healing is a testament by itself for a properly done procedure and you are welcome.                                                                  \n                                                                                                                           \nResponsibility is the price of freedom - Optimus Prime :)",

Let us methodically explain each of your concerns.\n\n(1) We use state of the art Allengers High frequency and low radiation x-ray machines for the best clarity least radiation dosage, and the cost of the x-ray is on par with any other centre and definitely cheaper than all the corporate hospitals.\n\n(2) All the blood and imaging diagnostics are processed from the clinic via well accredited and reliable labs for pinpoint accuracy and the patient`s convenience so that they don't have to run from pillar to post.\n\n(3) And because of that, we were able to nail the diagnosis rather than shoot in the dark without any guesswork involved.\n\n(4) We do not deploy a plaster of Paris cast for the above-mentioned condition; instead, we use a lightweight synthetic cast for optimal strength and patient comfort.\n\nAll in all, we are glad to know that you have found another doctor who could help you with this. If you need any knowledge transfer, assistance or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. \n\nGlad to be of service.\n\nThank you.\n \nPS: With all due respect, please refrain from using abusive language, we as medical professionals deserve dignity like any other service providers in the market and should not be put through such harassment.",

That being said, some patients take more time than the others as they could have extensive history to cover and loads of documents from multiple doctors to go through chronologically and arrive at a calculate diagnosis. Yes, you may have seen the patient smiling in my room, I would consider that a great achievement on my side if the patient leaves the room with a smile rather than a gloomy face. At the end of the day a positive attitude in the patient greatly enhances the outcome of the treatment. I hope you got better with my treatment of your knee pain. Thank you for the feedback.\n\n\n",

This is a standard practice in healthcare and helps us provide efficient and effective care to our patients, ensuring continuity of care even if physical files are lost. Using cutting-edge technology to provide quality patient care is not a crime or negligence, but rather a way to enhance the level of care we can provide. In fact, I also use an Apple iPad to show 3D human anatomy in an interactive way, which many patients appreciate.\n\nRegarding the cost of the X-rays, it is important to note that your mother required them for both knees and her entire spine, which is why the cost was incurred. This is a standard procedure and is typically less expensive than at other hospitals or diagnostic centres.\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAs a responsible doctor, I believe in treating the root cause of a patient's illness rather than just prescribing painkillers and sending them on their way. In the case of your mother, as she had a very early hysterectomy at the age of 23 I advised her to undergo bone density and other tests to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nI also want to clarify that we do encourage our patients to obtain medical tests from outside diagnostic centres as long as they are accredited by national and international board standards. \n_______________________________________________________________________\nWe review reports from outside facilities and have tie-ups with accredited labs. If there is any discrepancy or inaccuracy in the report, we can repeat the sample for free that is the commitment we have to our patients. We can't bear the burden of inaccurate testing and inevitably delaying the diagnosis and treatment of our patients.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nWith all due respect, If you have any further concerns or questions about the technology we use or our approach to patient care, please do not hesitate to contact us. We are always available to elaborate and address any concerns you may have. \n_________________________________________________________________________\nRegards \nDr Kiran Reddy Chennuri",

That's not how modern medicine works, it is all evidence-based and backed by research. I don't start with major diagnostic tests and procedures in the beginning without substantial proof of the condition. I start with simple medications first and advise lifestyle modifications, only if they don't work then some more investigations and tests are asked for and only then an intervention such as surgery is advocated. \n\nI wish you were accompanying the patient so that you could understand what I was trying to explain to her and advise her. I wish you accompanied her at least the second time rather than writing an unjustified review from the comfort of your couch. If it is an instant quick fix you are looking for your ailing mother in law I suggest you stop visiting a hospital.\n\nThank you for taking the time and writing your feedback. I totally appreciate it. Feedbacks like these do help a lot to keep reality in check. Only thing I really hope this feedback was not a way to vent out your frustration in life and defame someone just for the pleasure of it. \n\nThank you.",
