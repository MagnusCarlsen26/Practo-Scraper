Each time the experience was beyond expectation. No unnecessary investigations or procedure. Investigations are only what is required, diagnosis and treatment is to the point!\n\nFor me he insisted on getting an MRI scan done for my spine and prescribed exercises and pain relieving medicines. I was fit within a week and have never had the pain again.\n\nFor my 82 year father again one x ray, one physical consultation and bed rest as advised did the trick. No unnecesary procedures. He was available for follow up consultations over phone and responded to all our queries on whatsapp. So we always felt under his active care.\n\nThank you Dr Ashwin for all that you did for us!\n ",
