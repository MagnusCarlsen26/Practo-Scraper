Even after my retirement from NIMS I referred quite a no of patients to him. He has taken utmost care towards the patients. He listens to the patients coolly, keenly and gives suitable advice and treats with less medication. While treating the patient he will always be cheerful and looks the patient as one of his family members. Patient need a cardial behavior by the doctor. This sort of treatment/conduct gives more confidence and satisfaction among the patients. This sort of cardial behavior with the patients is very much in Dr. L. Krishna. He is having excellent experience in treating the cardiac patients. I have no hesitation in strongly recommending Dr. L. Krishna for cardiac treatment.",

He listens to the patients coolly, keenly and gives suitable advice and treats with less medication. While treating the patient he will always be cheerful and looks the patient as one of his family members. Patient need a cardial behavior by the doctor. This sort of treatment/conduct gives more confidence and satisfaction among the patients. This sort of cardial behavior with the patients is very much in Dr. L. Krishna. He is having excellent experience in treating the cardiac patients. I have no hesitation in strongly recommending Dr. L. Krishna for cardiac treatment.",
