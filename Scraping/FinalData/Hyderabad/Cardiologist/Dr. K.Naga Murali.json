It could have been better if the connectivity with the doctor and the patient was not that good because of language problem so to explain the thing it takes a lot of time if that improve it could be great, patients can visit him he won't give fake promises we can rely on that doctor he won't take you to the wrong path whatever needed he gives that only not other extras.",

I was having questions but he was in so hurry as so many patients waiting outside. \nNot recommended if you want to discuss in detail or have questions.\nThere will be two staff members along with doctor waiting to escort you outside and call another patient. Rs 750 for 3 or 4 minutes of consultation.",
