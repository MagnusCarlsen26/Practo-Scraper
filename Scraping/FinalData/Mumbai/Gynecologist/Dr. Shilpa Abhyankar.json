She has been extremely involved and  meticulous with respect to scans and ensuring that me and the baby were safe. I  had an  episode of bleeding for which she was present even at 4 am. She made arrangements for premature delivery and NICU if need be. Close to my due date I found the fetal movements to be lesser. She was prompt in asking me to do a scan and planned for an emergency c section and which was the best decision! Even post the delivery she was involved and concerned about the baby as well as my health. The post natal checksups and guidance were very helpful.\nAll in all, I could not have asked for a more knowledgeable, meticulous and concerned gynecologist for my first preganancy. ",

She is truly professional and very humble human being. She was always there to listen to all my worries and doubts. She is absolutely relaxed and completely firm with her views which helps us pacify ourselves in times of confusion. She was and is a great support system whenever I needed her right from the first day and continues till date. I am extremely happy with the entire experience.. Not only that but her hospital staff is extremely good and prompt, very supportive and encouraging. I would surely and blindly recommend her. Absolutely happy to be treated by her. ",

I had to go out of my way to offer up information.\n3. The doctor did not want to discuss my history when she heard that I would want to come in for an in-person appointment for the actual examination (not caring for the money I had already spent).  \n4. She made no attempt to offer any comfort or context when I disclosed what was ailing me. \n\nI fully understand that the consultation had to be limited until the actual examination and I made that clear.

She did not explain in much detail about my concern.  I kept asking her questions but did not get satisfactory answers. I am very much tensed about the problems but she did not ease that tension. She has asked me to do certain tests to further know about my PCOS. I am going to continue my treatment with her. Hopefully I will be happy in my next visit. Just expecting her to be more friendly ,so that it will relieve my tensions while discussing things later and I can carry on with this treatment. ",
