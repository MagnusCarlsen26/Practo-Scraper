Dr Pooja made us feel comfortable, listened to all our concerns, and answered every question with patience and clarity.\nRight from our first visit, she listened to all our concerns related to high-risk pregnancy. She managed multiple bleeding episodes, a short cervix, and many other critical problems throughout the pregnancy. She understood our needs due to our complicated medical history and provided the best care.\nWhat truly sets Dr Pooja apart is her interactions with patients after every visit, we came out smiling forgetting all our worries. She gave us the confidence that we can sail through this without fail. She was always available 24*7 whenever we needed help. Throughout the pregnancy, she helped and explained everything she foresaw any problems and prepared us for that.\nDuring the delivery, Dr Pooja was a pillar of strength and support. In the end moment when the baby was not doing great, she decided to do an emergency LSCS(C-section) and delivered our healthy daughter.\nAt each step, we trusted Dr pooja and never doubted in our mind about the treatment and care she was providing.\nI always heard that doctors are like gods who save and give lives, and now I trust yes there are some doctors like that Dr Pooja is one of them.\nI want to thank Dr Pooja from the bottom of my heart for helping us become parents after 10 years long struggle.\n\nThanks \nSaurabh and Ritu\n",

She explains everything in detail and in simple language, making it easy for anyone to understand, even those with no medical background. She takes the time to thoroughly explain each situation and provides ample time for each patient. I have been her patient since 2018. Initially, I had a polyp issue, and other doctors told me that surgery was the only option. However, I sought a second opinion and was fortunate to find Dr. Pooja. She successfully treated my polyp issue without surgery, and I was overjoyed to avoid the operating table. Since then, I have been consulting Dr. Pooja for all my gynecological issues. In 2023, I became pregnant, and everything was fine until six months in, when my reports indicated complications. I had placenta previa, and my autoimmune disorder was triggered by the pregnancy, causing my blood to thicken and my placenta to calcify. Additionally, my amniotic fluid levels dropped after eight months. Despite these high-risk pregnancy complications, Dr. Pooja provided the best possible treatment, and I managed to carry my pregnancy to 38 weeks, which was considered a remarkable achievement given the risks of preterm delivery associated with placenta previa. Throughout my pregnancy, I frequently messaged or called Dr. Pooja with my concerns, and she always responded promptly, putting me at ease. *** *** ******* * ****** *** **** ************ * **** **** ************",

Dr Pooja made us feel comfortable, listened to all our concerns, and answered every question with patience and clarity.\nRight from our first visit, she listened to all our concerns related to high-risk pregnancy. She managed multiple bleeding episodes, a short cervix, and many other critical problems throughout the pregnancy. She understood our needs due to our complicated medical history and provided the best care.\nWhat truly sets Dr Pooja apart is her interactions with patients after every visit, we came out smiling forgetting all our worries. She gave us the confidence that we can sail through this without fail. She was always available 24*7 whenever we needed help. Throughout the pregnancy, she helped and explained everything she foresaw any problems and prepared us for that.\nDuring the delivery, Dr Pooja was a pillar of strength and support. In the end moment when the baby was not doing great, she decided to do an emergency LSCS(C-section) and delivered our healthy daughter.\nAt each step, we trusted Dr pooja and never doubted in our mind about the treatment and care she was providing.\nI always heard that doctors are like gods who save and give lives, and now I trust yes there are some doctors like that Dr Pooja is one of them.\nI want to thank Dr Pooja from the bottom of my heart for helping us become parents after 10 years long struggle.\n\nThanks \nSaurabh and Ritu\n",

She explains everything in detail and in simple language, making it easy for anyone to understand, even those with no medical background. She takes the time to thoroughly explain each situation and provides ample time for each patient. I have been her patient since 2018. Initially, I had a polyp issue, and other doctors told me that surgery was the only option. However, I sought a second opinion and was fortunate to find Dr. Pooja. She successfully treated my polyp issue without surgery, and I was overjoyed to avoid the operating table. Since then, I have been consulting Dr. Pooja for all my gynecological issues. In 2023, I became pregnant, and everything was fine until six months in, when my reports indicated complications. I had placenta previa, and my autoimmune disorder was triggered by the pregnancy, causing my blood to thicken and my placenta to calcify. Additionally, my amniotic fluid levels dropped after eight months. Despite these high-risk pregnancy complications, Dr. Pooja provided the best possible treatment, and I managed to carry my pregnancy to 38 weeks, which was considered a remarkable achievement given the risks of preterm delivery associated with placenta previa. Throughout my pregnancy, I frequently messaged or called Dr. Pooja with my concerns, and she always responded promptly, putting me at ease. *** *** ******* * ****** *** **** ************ * **** **** ************",

Dr Pooja is an Intelligent Doctor I must say. When I went to her during my last trimester as we shifted to Mumbai and wanted a reliable doctor. After visiting her in December 2023, I was convinced with her understanding. Her logic and basics are very clear. She is a very straightforward Doctor and gives clear information with reasoning if you ask her any questions or queries. She listens carefully even though she is super busy and gives answers and never ignores your question. She was very much comfortable with giving online consultation since we were coming from Far away (Wadala to Malad ) and due to Placenta Previa wanted to avoid travel. She gave proper support in this regard understanding the situation and was even ready to travel to CloudNine vashi center in case needed.The most important thing i liked was that she met me once in December 2023 and she remembered that I took only 1 dose of Tetanus only. Understand, it could be protocol for a series of injections. But she clearly remembered the second dose of pending was amazing. And gave me confidence for her to do Surgery on me.Just to add I have had a history of multiple miscarriages, multiple IVFs failures, and the age factor too. So it's considered to be a real high risk pregnancy. But thankfully i was fortunate and blessed with the baby boy bov after 10 years.She provided exceptional care throughout my pregnancy journey with her and delivery, demonstrating a remarkable blend of professionalism, expertise, and compassion.  During operation their expertise and quick decision-making ensured a safe delivery for both me and my baby. The support staff were equally remarkable, providing attentive care and creating a comforting environment. The safety measures implemented were thorough, making me feel confident in the care I was receiving. I highly recommend Dr Pooja as she handled a very complex surgery with utmost patience n outstanding care .",

Her upbeat vibes always helped me stay focused.No problems were encountered during the trip, and timely direction was provided. I'd like to thank her for her excellent assessment up until this point. She provided me with the appropriate energy to ease my pain even when I went into labor.Blessed with a boy child by God's grace. She is a fantastic doctor because of her professionalism, upbeat attitude, smile, excellent listening skills, intimate knowledge of her patients' medical histories, and thorough justification of any necessary procedures. Would advise everyone to use her for their pregnancy journey.Thank you Dr. Pooja Shukla",

Things weren't pretty good at my health side as I was recovering from covid 19 and stomach ulcer hence things were quite uncertain. What made it even more complicated was moving in to a completely new city for me ie Mumbai. Unsure about good medical facility in my nearby area I went to hospital Malad as it was a Maternity specialized hospital.There I met Dr Pooja Shukla and raised all my concern and health issues. She was a very patient with all my queries and she guided me regarding all my health concern.The first time I heard the heart beat of my baby me and my husband both were elated \u2665\ufe0f.But this was not it,  continuously juggling from office work to handling pregnancy was getting difficult. In my second trimester I got gestational diabeties, hypertension and severe abdominal pain. Dr Pooja Shukla was always there to constantly guide, gave me best possible medications and was keeping track with multiple sonography just to ensure that both me and the baby is fine. I cannot forget her constant reminder to me that \"Shipra for me both the health of baby and you is important\". Be it on overnight calls or early morning checkup Dr Pooja Shukla was always there for me. As I reached my third trimester due to hypertension, uncontrollable gestational diabeties I experienced breathlessness even I couldn't feel my baby movements. My heart sank and we panicked. My family immediately contacted Dr Pooja Shukla who was not in the town recommended me to admitted in a near multi-speciality hospital. Within no time she spoke to the doctor's there and arranged everything for me even before I could reach there. I can never forget the day called me at 12 in the night and ask me about health and reiterated that for me it doesn't matter if she does the delivery or the doctor in the other hospital her priority is our safety so that we are out of danger of risking our life. My situation was brought under control and the she was constantly in touch with the doctor's there .Finally after consulting with an endocrinologist her team Dr Pooja Shukla and we decided to go for an elective C section which was still risky as it was only 33 weeks and the baby was still very premature. On 24 February my son Ved was born. \ud83d\ude0a\u2665\ufe0fIt wasn't a easy journey but the constant support and guidance given by Dr Pooja Shukla along with the support of my family both me and my baby was healthy and happy. \ud83d\ude0aThe post operation care given my hospital was exceptionally good. The hospital rooms were very neat and clean also spacious.Staff was courteous and polite. All facilities including food and medical was good. Both me and my husband would like to thank Dr Pooja Shukla as she provided me the best in class most advanced treatment, she diagnosed my issues properly, was a constant support, her correct guidance brought us out of the risk of losing my baby and her timely tracking of growth of the child and the same time comforting me all the emotional trauma i went through. \u2665\ufe0f  Angels always do not come only in fairy tails but some also come with the white coat saving lives. Thank you Dr Pooja Shukla. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\u2695\ufe0f",

Her profound understanding of regional health dynamics proved invaluable, guiding us through necessary tests and ultimately prompting us to delay our pregnancy plans for our safety.\n\nDespite the distance, we traveled 120 km for every appointment, highlighting our unwavering trust in her expertise. Throughout a challenging pregnancy journey marked by blood thinners, frequent scans, and numerous complications, Dr. Shukla's guidance was indispensable.\n\nFinally, our perseverance led to the joyous arrival of our baby boy, a testament to Dr. Shukla's ********** experience, and compassionate care. Her professionalism, humility, and warmth make her an exceptional doctor, and I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking unparalleled medical expertise and support.",

Before this, I had seen doctors at reputed hospitals in Mumbai, and can say that she's one of the best gynaecologist in the city that you can find. Pregnancy is not an easy journey, specially when you have complications involved. It's not just her medical advice, but also her counsel and support, which I received from Dr Pooja. Every time I visited her, I came back home with a smile and affirmation of me and my baby being healthy and in safe hands. She was always there to respond to my queries. I had two episodes of bleeding in my first trimester, running across Mumbai and Navi Mumbai consulting different Gynaecs. It was Dr Pooja who figured out the exact cause. I felt a personal care in medication provided by her. When I was put on a daily dose of injection Lonopin, I was scared initially, but she took all care and effort to make me understand reason behind my medication. She never takes queries on her ego, rather gives a definite medical reason behind everything. Among other things, one thing which stood out was that she took complete care and responsibility for the well being of her patient, taking calculated calls based on advice of different specialised medical practitioners. I also had an episode of rheumatoid arthritis where she made sure that the medication I was advised is safe for the baby, even though I was consulting a rheumatologist at the same time. At present I trust her to an extent, that even post delivery, I do not take any medication until confirmed by her. She has cared for me like a doctor and counselled me like a family. A very empathetic person, something that a patient in pain expects from her doctor, and really justifies the job she is in.",

Pooja  . The way she handled our pregnancy and delivery , it\u2019s remarkable. She is a perfect blend of good human being and a doctor.  Thank u so much dr.

So I started taking her video consultation in first trimester of pregnancy as I had high nausea problem and visited multiple doctors but no relief. Since the day I started taking her consultation and medication I found relief and could enjoy my pregnancy journey as well...I was so impressed and confident with her that I decided to do my delivery with Dr Pooja Shukla only and for that I shifted to Mumbai at my sister's place from Satara. The way she use to listen patiently and positively her patient is incredible and unmatched as well...She personally took care of me and was always available anytime which made me sure that I'm in safe hands and she made me feel like a family. She involves in such a way in pregnancy  which gives a peace of mind throughout the journey.\nWe both Sisters are really thankful to her and  strongly recommend Dr Pooja Shukla for an absolute safe happy and healthy pregnancy journey.",

I have been looking for a good gynaecologist in Mumbai since the past 5 years and have been struggling to find one who is empathetic, a listener and gives you ample time to address all your concerns etc. Thanks to my pregnancy, we happened to visit Cloudnine and we were referred to her by a friend. And honestly, my pregnancy felt like a breeze with her support and consultations. What an expert she is - regular check ups, report analysis, making me understand what's going on with my body, what and what not to expect, no unnecessary medicines or tests, patience of listening to all my queries and more so showing empathy (which is rare to find in good doctors) , explaining in detail each and every aspect of why these tests/medicines are being recommended and how will they help, friendliness and patience- she has it all! \nWe started with Cloudnine thinking let's start looking for a consulting gynaecologist and we might need to visit 3-4 before we find the doctor of our choice/preference and luckily enough our search started and ended with Dr. Pooja and we were confident that we were in good hands from Day 1 itself :) During the course of time we were so comfortable and confident in Dr. Pooja that we did not go to our home town where our family was and decided to deliver in Mumbai itself under her guidance :)\nI am now a mother of a 1 month old boy and my pregnancy has been a wonderful experience thanks to her, all the support she provided and more so being available to answer and address the slightest queries that we had. Rarely we find a doctor who is so approachable round the clock, empathetic, patient, follow ups just to check how you are doing, and an expert on the topic! We are grateful to Dr. Pooja for such a wonderful experience and her constant support and guidance. She is now my permanent consulting gynaecologist:-)",

                "review_text": "I am a patient with a history of myomectomy, Level 4 endometriosis and ANA therefore conceived through IVF. As if these werent enough I ended up having delivery complications with a ruptured bladder. Dr Pooja Shukla managed all of these with such extreme confidence and grace that today i have my lovely daughter by my side which otherwise wouldnt have been possible.\n\nMy journey to my pregnancy started a year back with surgeries for hernia, myomectomy and endometriosis followed by IVF. During this time ive met close to a dozen of OB/GYNs of which some were HOD or they were celebrity doctors that are deemed as the \u201cbest\u201d doctors in town as per google but none of them matched up to what Dr. Pooja was capable to do in my case.\nI met Dr. Pooja post conceiving through IVF in my 6th month of pregnancy. We ( i and my husband) met her after a lot of research on the internet. So far we always went for doctors with years of experience as I believed experienced doctors would be able to manage my case better but as Dr. Pooja is a high risk case expert and reading the feedback/various cases of her patients we thought of ditching my clause of experience for a change. \nAnd an expert she is! After patiently listening to my entire case she gave us a clear view of the possible challenges and complications ahead of us. She meticulously followed an organised method of elimination to ensure right medicines and care was taken. She was also connected with me everyday since day 1. If ever i missed she would check on me herself! And on the day of delivery i couldnt be more thankful for her eye for detail and judgment on my situation which otherwise would have been dismissed costing us our child. \n\nThere are several doctors out there but there are very few who are passionate about being one. Dr. Pooja is one of those few who is a doctor by choice. Her professionalism and empathy especially towards my family through the journey and more so at the time of 3hr-long surgery is something i and my husband will always be grateful for. We now find a friend and a guide in her with whom we would love to be connected for long.",

She has complete knowledge of each and every query related to her subject....I came across Dr. Pooja through internet... I got pregnant in the month of Jan 2021 and had no idea which gynaecologist to consult and which maternity home to select for delivery... After a detailed research on internet I found cloud nine hospital.. went through the reviews and got convinced that I can deliver my baby here... After that the challenge was to search for a gynaecologist as cloud nine has many doctors on their panel... this is when i came across Dr. pooja's profile and went through the reviews... Me and my husband decided to meet her once and see if we can continue with her or else we will change the doctor... we are so glad for this decision of ours... we booked an appointment and went for the first appointment ... had missed my period and home pregnancy test was positive yet we were so anxious whether this news is true or not ... the moment we met Dr. pooja we found her so friendly and polite...after confirmation of pregnancy the way she explained everything in detail about the entire pregnancy journey, how to calculate weeks/months, pregnancy scans, medications etc was remarkable.... that was the time we decided that she will be our only gynaec for future.... all the issues we faced during pregnancy she always was just a call away.... u msg her with the smallest thing and she would always revert. This gave us assurance and confidence... as a first time mom and staying in a nuclear family u have so many queries and concerns... Dr. pooja was always a go to person in the entire journey.... the way she explains everything logically, we always felt that we are in safe hands.... Thank u Mam for all your support and care to bring our little angel in this world.... i would recommend Dr. Pooja to all the females out there for all your health issues/pregnancy issues and delivery",

I am now in London and due next week..\nInstead of me telling her to take video consultation, she did not bother to take one, as face to face is what is required specially in pregnancy.. \nI offered her so many times but she kept on assisting me without a doubt, no consultation nothing..\nShe has helped me with many others things during these whole 9 months and have given utmost care thou she isn't my first point of contact , I have changed country, but she still replies me for everything just like a family would.. believe me if you are looking for an experienced doctor and someone who u can directly reach to... It's Pooja Shukla.\nIf any other doctor u choose, u won't even have thier private number, u have to call the call center wait for the person to get online, out of office hours, voicemail and so many things..\nBut with Pooja, it's just a what's app msg and you will be looked after. The best doctor so far I feel..\nOnlyy and only Pooja Shukla.\nIf you are going cloud nine, please specifically ask for her.. beleive me you will always appreciate her for her good work for your life .",

Conceiving, had been a long wait in my married life, rather one diminishing flare of hope. We had tried other doctors, nothing worked. Maybe we were destined to be delivered at the hands of this angel, Dr. Pooja. How else do we explain it. Right from the first meeting, she explained to us every small detail which was important as it was a late conception. During this visit itself I felt absolutely comfortable with her. And, as we moved forward with our consultation, we realised different facets of her as a professional. She has a special touch. She had answers to all our queries. Her excitement was as great as ours. Her prompt response and explanations were assuring to us. Her approach to solve any problem was unique and systematic. I delivered my baby in lockdown. She not only provided us with the list of medicines that we were supposed to have during pandemic but went out of her way to help us during the lockdown. It is because of her that we decided to stay in Mumbai for delivery. I think she is a super doctor and a fantastic human being. She knows her topic very well. She is confident. She will also follow up regularly to check her patients update. She will be often found zipping around the Cloud 9 lobbies always for her patients. The best part is her human touch....and that cannot be measured on any scale. It is difficult to find such doctors nowadays.\nToday I have my baby with me who is fit and fine.\nWe are very happy and proud parents. All thanks to Dr. Pooja for her efforts and support during this time of pandemic. We pray every expectant couple to be blessed with a doctor like her. When I was taken to the delivery room during lockdown, and my husband couldn't be around me due to the pandemic protocol, he told Dr. Pooja, you are her only friend accompanying her. So True. She is a doctor, a friend, a silent support....you will know it and feel it. God Bless her!",

                "review_text": "DR. POOJA SHUKA\n\nOur meeting with Dr. Pooja was fateful and in my opinion something that destiny had in store for me. So our was an IVF Conception and we were elated at the thought of finally having our first child. We thought it was going to be a smooth ride but unfortunately It wasn\u2019t to be. For my routine scans and pregnancy follow-ups, I decided to visit the Women\u2019s Hospital Khar as I & my family had been visiting that hospital for the past 20 years for our gynaecology related issues. Our initial consultations and scans were good. The pregnancy was progressing well and I was on course with my medication & high protein diet which my doctor had advised. However In my 7th month of pregnancy, one of the days I felt that the foetal movements were not the usual. I called the hospital and was asked to come in for a doppler check. The heartbeat was normal and my doctor advised me to come in for a scan the next day. Looking at the scan, the sonologist informed us that my AFI has significantly dropped and from 15 to 9, although the growth parameters were normal until then. My Doctor advised me to go on a high protein diet and take 3 alamine infusions in 9-10 days. I followed and we were asked to get a scan done after 2 weeks. In the follow-up the AFI was stagnant at 8, however the growth parameters had dropped and our baby was not growing as per gestational age. My doctor tagged the slow growth to the low AFI and the mother\u2019s nutrition not reaching the baby which she said happens. In our follow-up scan after 2 weeks the parameters had fallen even further and my doctor just asked me to keep on with the diet and follow up after 2 weeks. During this entire period my doctor did not think of investigating \u2018Why the AFI was falling?\u2019. Considering I reside in Kandivali, we had thought of going to Cloudnine in my last stages of pregnancy to keep it was a backup option in case of emergency. However the circumstances were such that we thought of visiting Cloudnine for a second opinion, we booked an appointment with Dr. Pooja considering her background and reviews. In our first meeting which was 3 days after our last scan, she patiently listened to our entire case history and her first action was to investigate\u2019 Why my AFI was low\u2019. She explained us the factors why it happens during which she mentioned placental calcification as one of the reasons why AFI and growth reduces. She got a few blood tests done which came out normal. She also got an NST done to check the well being of the baby and a scan done to check on the calcification. The scan confirmed the presence of calcification in the placenta, however looking at the NST she thought lets push it as much as we can with close monitoring to ensure the baby does not have to be in the NICU for long. She gave me an injection to prepare the baby for an early delivery and at the same time put me on a blood thinner injection so that my nutrition can reach the baby. She put us on a closely monitored schedule of 2 scans, 2 NSTs, consultation, some medications to help with the growth and also advised on a diet which directly impacts the baby\u2019s growth. After a week, we miraculously saw an increase in baby\u2019s growth, the weight increased from 1760gms to 1962gms to 2114gms in 2 weeks. It was because of her approach that I could enter the 9th month of my pregnancy. After I completed my 35th week she advised us to deliver. She always said,\u201d You can give the baby all the nutrition it wants once its out, do not crave for 50-60gms of weight increase inside\u201d. She delivered me and I had baby boy. The baby was doing well except for some grunting which was because of some fluid entering the baby\u2019s lungs. He was put on oxygen for 4 days after which he was handed over to us. I am glad I met Dr. Pooja at a time when nothing was going right, I am glad she patiently listened to us, guided in the right direction and eventually delivered at the right time. I am and will forever be incredibly grateful to her. ",

She prescribed me all the required tests after hearing my symptoms and went an extra mile in explaining what each test meant and what its results indicate. She not only prescribed the required medicines to take care of the hormonal imbalance but also explained the reasons of why a certain medicine has been advised to me to be taken. She is brilliant in putting a pateint at ease and all the new doctors should take classes from her of the same. I cannot thank her enough and will forever be indebted to her. She's an amazing human being and I love her for a phenomenal role she has played in my life. Love you Dr.Shukla and God bless u always.",

She handled her case with utmost care and always helped her to stay positive so that she could steer through her pregnancy in most convenient manner. As a first time parents, obviously like other parent we too had lots of queries and doubt in our mind but dr pooja helped clear all those with ease and make us understand every detail related to pregnancy. Her guidance, support and experience has helped us during pregnancy. I appreciate how approachable she is, that we could easily reach out her over whatsApp messages and on phone at any point of time even at 12 noon at night or 4 am in morning. We always got satisfactory guidance at different stages of pregnancy which left no room of doubt for us for taking any kind of decision. We are very thankful for her careful involvement, hand holding and proper treatment that gave us healthy baby and quick recovering mom. We are blessed to have her as our doctor. We are very grateful for her care and support. We would highly recommend all parents / moms / to be moms to visit Dr. Pooja.    Thank you",

We felt very comfortable with the fact that she guided us to make very subtle changes to our lifestyle. Thus certainly helped reduce all the stress & anxiety that comes from the advice of everyone around us, especially when you are a first time parent. \n\nEven during our time at the hospital, she took out time to specially visit us at midnight to ensure that we're feeling confident about heading back home with the baby.\n\nThe way she kept boosting my confidence along the entire pregnancy journey has also helped me avoid bouts of anxiety. I'm glad that we found her and as we celebrate our little one first month, we would recommend anyone in the Mumbai suburbs to consult her if you're looking for a friendly doctor to guide you along the journey of being a parent.\n",

We met her for the first time in Sept 2020 for pre conception counseling with anxiety and fear of not knowing anything. But within seconds Dr made us comfortable. She motivated us after answering to all our fears and questions by guiding us in correct direction. Shortly after that I conceived in Feb 2021 and lost our baby in the 2nd trimester without any visible cause. During this time it was Dr Pooja who counselled and guided us on way forward. She was a strong support to me and my husband during this traumatic situation. Soon after this incident Dr Pooja started with her investigation as to what went wrong and charted our way forward based on her findings. Dr was confident that we will have 100% success. In Jan 2022 we conceived again. We followed the plan that Dr Pooja had charted. Plan include blood thinners and immunity injections, diets changes, medicines, weekly scans and regular blood test. Each of the parameters in the plan was well explained to us with the reason why we required it. Dr made this challenging journey a cake walk with her knowledge, expertise and caring nature. We blindly trusted Dr Pooja during our pregnancy journey and she gave us the most precious gift, our baby boy. *** **** *** ****** ******* ** **** ** **** ***** I would recommend Dr Pooja to whomsoever planning to start a family. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 to her.",

She has immense knowledge and takes decisions quickly. She was always available on the call/messages to help us which made us at ease. Ours was a preterm delivery hence we needed someone who can assure us of a successful delivery and she did exactly the same by repeatedly telling us that you guys don\u2019t worry I am there. Her decision to delivery baby by operation was very timely to not put baby under stress. She is a wonderful doctor and human being. Even after delivery doctor herself clicked baby - mumma pics and she brought baby to meet all the family members. All thanks to her for delivering our baby safe and healthy. Thank you doctor.",

When we met Dr. Pooja for the first time it was like we are meeting one of our old friend or I can say she is like the elder sister. Journey of pregnancy was so smooth and joyful with her as she was always there with us for even a very small query.  We were positive at the beginning itself but it was she who made the complete journey happier. We find her very different than any other Doctor as she gives more time to patient and explain the issues if any, whenever she write any medical test, she explain everything in details  about  the requirement, benefit and result she want to get from it etc. It was the second phase of corona & we got covid positive which was the toughest part, but it was Dr. Pooja who kept us really positive ensuring that there was no harm to our baby. The best part was that even she was carrying at that time but she made herself always available to us, this proves that she always gives priority to her patients and cares for them. She is such a great person to talk with that anyone will forget the problem he or she is facing and that is how a doctor should be who makes you forget your problems. She is humble, very caring by nature and most important she is very much passionate about her work. People say \u201cDr. is second God\u201d she make this phrase True.  We will be always thankful to Dr. Pooja for all her advice and support.",

In fact, it wouldn\u2019t be a lie if I say that I continued at the cloud nine hospital mainly because of Dr. Pooja. She is the most approachable, friendly, understanding gynaecologist dr. I ever met in my life. Based on my past delivery experience, I didn\u2019t have a good image about gynac dr. but Dr. Pooja changed my perception. She is available for help even if you call her at 4.am in the morning (and believe me I did call her at weird times during my pregnancy). She keeps entire nine months pregnancy treatment/process as much natural as possible and do not prescribe unnecessary medicines/tests like other so called best gynac in the city do. I am not an easy patient to manage and takes stress unnecessarily but she managed me with lot of love and care. I really wish I could have found her for my first pregnancy as well.\n\nThank you Dr. Pooja for giving me my angel and correcting things that has gone wrong in my first pregnancy :)",

Dr. Pooja patiently explained my present condition with diagrams and the way forward. She was available on calls and messages the entire night only after my first visit as the treatment had started. We knew that we were in the right hands.We continued consulting her and completely relied upon her. Her medicines, judgement of the situation and action to be taken has been spot on throughout.From helping us to conceive till the time of my delivery, she helped us overcome all challenges. Inspite of the many complications, she never let us down and always helped us when we were worried and stressed by replying to messages and calls be it day or night even after her own delivery.Dr. Pooja Shukla is highly professional and an expert in her field. We trust her blindly as she made parenthood possible for us as smoothly as one can.Thank you so much ma'am for going above and beyond in doing everything for us. You made our visits from Lower Parel to Malad worthwhile.",

I had severe vomiting and weakness and I just had to WhatsApp her and she replied to me immediately without meeting her and shared medications that night, remembering me after 5 years\ud83d\ude0a . I was immediately fine with the medication she gave me , while I was struggling with nautia since 2 months and no relief through medication from other doctor.\nShe is a god sent gift to every person and I decided to continue my pregnancy journey with her although I live far from Malad. However every visit is worth it and every test scan is explained well and told why it is needed. She doesn't prescribe unnecessary tests scans, meetings or medications. She builds your confidence.\nEven before the delivery doctor herself checked on me several times if all ok and I had a successful delivery of a baby girl this time \nI would reccomend Dr Pooja to everyone.",

Earlier we were clueless which doctor should I consult since I had never been to any gynac until then.\nMe and my husband were of the opinion to meet two or three obstetrician and then decide where we would go ahead with our further journey of pregnancy. Dr. Pooja was the first one we came in to meet and with our first visit \u206cwith her we decided to conclude our quest. There was comfort, no doubts in veracity of her knowledge and feeling of reliability which seemed assured unchallenging 9 months. Her medical counselling ensured good health of me, the mommy and my baby :) \nAll the queries were answered and explained in depth by her during the visits as well as on calls and messages. Being an highly experienced and knowledgeable doctor it never reflected adversely on her conduct with the patients as she was always available and also answering to the silliest questions I had. While I was due in October 2021 she herself was 8 months pregnant and I am glad she still delivered my baby. I would strongly recommend Dr. Pooja Shukla to all the expectant mothers undoubtedly.",

Right from the day I met her for the first time till the day of my delivery and post delivery she was always very helpful, caring and supportive. She not only provided her expert knowledge but also emotionally supported me. Still remember my first day When i met her at Cloudnine Hospital, Malad I was tensed, nervous and had many doubts in mind whether I will be able to conceive and deliver a baby.She really eased the tension that I was going through and made me believe that everything is fine. She explained me everything about natural conception and IUI in a simple and easy manner.Luckily I conceived with the 2nd IUI.I really cant forget that day when my blood reports came positive and I was pregnant. Right through my pregnancy phase I had to face many challenges but I was really fortunate that I had Dr Pooja by my side.She always responded my phone calls and messages and even if she was busy she would immediately call back. Even on the day of my delivery I was very anxious but she made calm and helped me to bring a perfect miracle into our life.  We blessed with baby boy last month. Me and my entire family is thankful to her for bringing lifetime of happiness to us.If you are really thinking to plan your baby I would definitely recommend Dr. Pooja Shukla without any doubt. ",

With no regrets Dr Pooja examined me and gave me medication and most importantly told me not to loose hope in trying for a baby. Honestly she had more confidence in me , than I had in myself at that time. To my luck in just few months I got pregnant and now blessed with a beautiful baby girl. \nMy Visits, interactions , treatment and the excellent knowledge shared by Dr Pooja, I consider it to be a blessing as I believe that am blessed with the best and all because of her motivation and pleasant interaction things went of very well and so smooth right until the last day. When I even took my husband and mother to the clinic for my  checkups they were satisfied with all that was told and how things were handled with real grace.\nMy experience overall has been great and all that I knew was I needed Dr Pooja to be there until the very end that I delivered my baby and she was there :) A big thank you to Dr Pooja \ud83d\ude4f. I looked forward to all my future checkups and treatment with her and I definitely recommend her as a must \"GO - TO\"  person for all your pregnancy needs.",

Today i thank my friend for introducing to such a beautiful person * **** ******* Things were going all fine initially but than little complication developed in my pregnancy and thats the time you need a well qualified and a best doctor to work out all the possibilities and Dr Pooja was the one. She was available for me anytime when i needed her. Even if u msg her for any doubts at midnight she use to reply immediatedly no matter any time of day. Finally v could handle all complication and by help of Dr Pooja i finally delivered a baby girl on 25 th april through C section. Everything went on smoothly. She is a gem of person. It hard to find such a gud doctor with lot of experience. I and my husband would definitely recommend Dr Pooja for pregnancy .",

We were made to feel very comfortable and all our doubts and questions were explained thoroughly and professionally.

We thereby continued with her for the pregnancy consultation and delivery. \nDuring the nine months, utmost care was taken with respect to mine and the baby\u2019s well being. She co ordinated and kept herself in loop with the other doctors for our scans and reports. Any problem we faced were immediately attended to and solved. At times we did not even had to come to the hospital. We were informed about what to expect next well in advance. She delivered (C-Sec) our first baby on 16th March 2021. She was instantly available in the middle of the night for the delivery when we needed her and before things could have had any complications. We were confident we were in the right hands and that helped us lessen our anxiety. I was very lucky to have found  Dr. Shukla who was very friendly, knowledgeable, confident and professional  without whom my pregnancy experience would not have been this smooth! Post delivery care also was very well explained and carried out.\nWe can\u2019t thank Dr.Pooja Shukla enough for this amazing trouble free journey and suggest all to definitely visit her for a great pregnancy experience!",

When we first met her, she came across as an extremely affable person, to whom we opened up. She suggested us few tests and the complete road map for the next 9 months. She didnt sound very authoritative and strict, infact she explained us in details few of the common myths related to pregnancy and misconception regarding food habits during pregnancy. She made us feel at ease and comfortable to do anything as my wife likes to do. She didnt stop us nor sounded alarmist for our travels during my wife\u2019s pregnancy. \nShe is an extremely good doctor who develops a bond with her patients and she is always approachable. ",

My husband and I panicked and were really anxious as we didn't know much about it and also there was so much uncertainty around restrictions that had been put in place by the government for performing surgical procedures in the times of Covid, then. She helped us remain calm, made us understand about the ailment well, by drawing diagrams and explaining the next course of action. As a young couple, it was the first time we were facing something like that. She took care of everything and was available throughout. Finally, we went for the surgical procedure which was a success. I felt I was in safe hands. Her approach, friendly nature, counselling and ways of handling everything made it super easy for us to deal with one of the most difficult phases of our lives. She is someone I can trust with closed eyes and have visited her a few more times only to realise that more. Thank you, Ma'am for everything!",

Her compassion towards her patients is unmatched. There were few anxious times in pregnancy but with her being there, we were assured that we are in safe hands that gave us a peace of mind all through.

Before her when we met other gynaecologists during 1st trimester, there was a small issue regarding sugar levels, but gynaecologists scared us for this. Dr. Pooja Shukla was amazing in telling the same science but in a simpler and customised approach, more importantly without creating an issue out of it.\n\nHer presence in my overall pregnancy was remarkable, and she continuously supported me for normal delivery and educated me at every step on how to make it possible. This helped me to finally deliver a normal and healthy baby and me a healthy mother!\n\nAll the credit goes to Dr. Pooja Shukla.\n\nShe was a blessing in my pregnancy journey and she still is.\n\nHighly  Highly recommended.\n\nDeepanti & Dhananjay ",

I have had consulted the most experienced, reputed celebrity doctors until now but Dr. Pooja Shukla is hands down the best doctor we have come across. She is not only rich with her knowledge in high risk pregnancies but also has deep care for her patients. In our first meeting we knew that we have made the right choice by consulting her. As my pregnancy progressed so did my anxiety, just by meeting and talking to Dr. Pooja, I would feel better & my anxiety will fade away. She has great counselling skills.  My journey was difficult with protein S deficiency but she made it easier with her solutions. I delivered a healthy baby in 38th week, all thanks to Dr Pooja Shukla. It is like universe brought us to her, we are so grateful to experience this journey with Dr Pooja Shukla.",

She  was available all the time and had replied to even tiny queries over messages and calls....which was really very helpful. I have met very few doctors who can make a patient feel comfortable and relaxed the way she does. Me and my entire family are so thankful to her. She is not just one of the best doctor but also a good human being. Thanks to her again..,..i would recommend everyone who is looking for good guidance and treatment, should meet Dr. Pooja.",

Her assuring and kind nature made me comfortable through out my pregnancy and delivery. when I used to be all stressed and was at critical stage she used to take care of me and motivate me. When I was on the edge of entering into my operation theatre and I was nervous and anxious she calmed me and asked to inhale deep breaths and soothed me.

She is extremely friendly and so clear in communication.\nWith every report and check up she would explain all parameters, what they indicate. It felt alot informative and very simple as a journey as I was always informed why are we following certain treatment. I had also caught COVID during pregnancy and her follow through just made it so simple to recover and pick up baby growth.\nI followed her instructions and medicines religiously and delivered a healthy (3.45kg) baby girl. \nEven during my process of delivery, she worked with me till the end to ensure the normal delivery and motivated me for the same. Due to non progressive labour I couldn't have normal delivery, but with my C section also I couldn't have had better experience.\nI would recommend Dr. Shukla blind fold to anyone trying for pregnancy or looking for a good Gynaecologist.",

Due to covid we moved to our hometown and luckily next month I conceived. Still i regularly consulted her online throughout my pregnancy. \nShe is very friendly  and reachable. She is also a good listener and her diagnosis and medications were always spot on.\nFurther even though due to Covid we could not meet each other personally, i still felt lot of warmth and satisfaction after talking to her.\nHighly recommended.",

I met her again last year for my recurring period issues and I want her to know that she sorted me just the way I wanted too. Her treatment is fairing me great results and surprisingly l am so happy to have met a doctor who is concerned and whose approach is not monetary.  Infact who believes in alternative medicines as much as in allopathic medicine. This year I got my recently turned teen daughter to for her issues. I can endorse her 10/10 for all her support and the way she takes stress of ailments off your mind. Thanks a tonne doc. ",

We discovered few issues whilst our journey. However it was Dr Pooja Shukla excellence who had thorough study of our case and predicted the possible issues that may challenge our bundle of joy. She made sure that situation remains in control and treated us with right medicines at the right time. It led to a smooth journey and Dr Pooja Shukla was with us throughout this. She is very approachable, very much active over WhatsApp and never shied away to attend phone calls at odd hours (in case of emergency). She gives ample time to her patients and asks several questions for diagnosis. She's one of the finest doctor we have ever met. Thank you so much Pooja ma'm for all your help in making our journey so smooth and ending it in even better way :)\nRegards\nShreeya & Deepak",

She is a doctor with a soothing bedside manner.Being a first time mother, I had lots of questions to ask and she was kind enough to give clarity on them.

I consulted Dr. Pooja for second opinion and within 2-3 days, I started feeling much better and since then, I never had any issue during my entire pregnancy. I now have 3 months old baby boy, all thanks to Dr. Pooja. She always gave answers to all our questions and trust me, we had plenty. She always felt her care was like that of an elder sister. Thank you Dr. Pooja for being so wonderful and patient. ",

It was my first pregnancy with ANA positive, and couldn\u2019t have been possible without Dr. Pooja. Right from  consultation, medications, midnight calls, she was there throughout. I can\u2019t forget my last trimester due to multiple complications due to ANA and + Dengue. Dr. Pooja helped me with intensive care and continuous support whether in person, on call, msg. Dr. Pooja is Godmother  to my child. Without her this journey wouldn\u2019t have been possible. It was a close call and in state of emergency, her expertise, decision making and confidence is the reason I have my baby absolutely safely delivered. She was prepared for all emergency cases in my pregnancy and had taken precautions already, her precautionary medications helped my baby develop even after being a pre term baby thanks to Dr. Pooja she was completely healthy. I will never forget the delivery of my child, Dr. Pooja was truly an Angel sent to save my Angel. \n\nThank you Dr. Pooja. \n\nTo whoever is reading this, you can trust Dr. Pooja blindly.",

I have never met any doctor before her who would proactively follow up with the patient. She would always listen to you patiently and answer to all your queries.\n\nThank you for your exceptional care and for taking time to explain to my husband the situation surrounding my pregnancy and delivery. Your smile and a positive attitude always ensured us that we were in safe hands. My daughter will be a year old soon but I still remember the visits, the labor day and the follow-ups post delivery all because, you made it so memorable for us.\n\nYou deserve a big Thank You for being there for your patients. Infact honestly I didn't feel like I'm your patient,but always felt like your family member.  \n\nKeep smiling and keep doing what you do so well! Wish you good luck.

After having tried to get pregnant for more than an year, all the doctors I saw made me believe there\u2019s something wrong with me. While nobody could understand what was the problem, they suggested me to go for painful tests like tube examination, etc. The day I saw Dr Pooja, firstly she comforted me and then explained everything possible that could be wrong. With just few blood tests she caught my hormonal imbalances and I was put on one tab twice a week and I couldn\u2019t even finish the 2 months course and I got pregnant. Since then due to my hormones dwindling I had something or the other going on each month, like diabetes and thyroid and painful puppp but the way Dr Pooja took care of everything is just commendable. All the medicines I was put on were well planned and well thought, she even kept a chart of my pregnancy schedule with what\u2019s needed when with her and followed up herself if I forgot to. On one of my regular checkups at 36 weeks, she spotted the baby heartbeat having dips with thickened water and she straight away planned for delivery. It was scary for sure but sikce I knew it was her, I had this faith that everything is going to be fine. She is literally a God sent person to me. I can never thank enough for all the support and care she\u2019s given me at the right time. Never have met a gynaecologist like her ever, so clear and focused! Highly recommended.",

I was taking injections to support my placenta and the baby, as recommended by the doctor, with this we were able to pull my pregnancy till 38th week. We could not wait for natural labour to start as my placenta was already ageing and my baby could go in distress. I was induced with pain in the morning and there was no progress till afternoon. She was completely transparent during our complete journey. So doctor decided to go ahead with C section and we could say that was the best decision. My husband has witnessed out baby coming into this world and he saw how badly she was stuck in the placenta. It was only because of Dr. Pooja that our baby girl is fine and I am healthy today. We cannot thank enough to Dr. Pooja for bringing our bundle of joy to the world healthy and happy! ",
