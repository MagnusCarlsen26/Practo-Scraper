Her friendly approach eases out the patient. When I first met her, her calm and composed self helped me to realise I was in the best hands. I have had the experience of being treated by her on a few occasions and the experience has been good. I trust her completely wrt my gynaecological health and would highly recommend to anyone seeking a trustworthy OB/GYN.
