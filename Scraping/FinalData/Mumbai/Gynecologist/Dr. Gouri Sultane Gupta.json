She is smart, knowledgeable, kind, understanding, modern and a pretty lady! I have found the best Gynaec for the rest of my life! I visited her the first time for my prolactin check in Feb 2023. She prescribed me one medicine for 3 months which was to be taken only at night and guess what it did wonders! My prolactin level came down to the right level within those 3 months! Backstory i was given the same medicine by the other doctor also, but just coz I was not told when and how to take the medicine it did not work! So here is the proof that doctor Gouri knows it all! Later I visited her the second time for my PCOD check and randomly told her about the acne issues I had been facing since my childhood and againnnn she gave me a course of one medicine, which I swear cleared the root cause of my acnes. I had acnes all over my face and would never go, they keep coming back one after the other but after the course given by doctor Gouri, by the end of third month I saw a drastic change and till now I have gotten no active acne on my face. Wait a second it was not just the medicine but I\u2019d like to be really clear that I did follow some diet like cutting off dairy products, fried food and I completely went off sugar. Also as recommended by Doctor Gouri I started having fruits and dry fruits every morning without fail. I visited her the third time again for a problem and I think she has solutions to every problemmmm that I have had till now. You can be as open with her as you want she has no judgements and would give you nothing but the best solutionsss!!! The clinic also has a very smooth process and good vibes. So, don\u2019t think twice before visiting her! She is the best Gynaec you\u2019ll find, trust me!!!",

We thought to ourselves ours is a normal conception so should I even go to her? But then we just ended up going & the very first interaction just felt so wonderful and then we continued & went to her over and over for the rest 9 months \ud83d\ude03. This beautiful lady took utter care of me & my little pea inside throughout my pregnancy just like she would care for a woman with IVF or any other problems \ud83e\udd70. I had a wonderful smooth experience throughout my pregnancy & the warmth that you get from her is just next level \ud83d\ude0d. Her staff are so friendly & well behaved & all sanitization practise was maintained. Her Clinic itself is really well maintained. I strongly strongly 1000% recommend Dr. Gouri to not only woman who have a normal conception but to even woman who have difficulty in getting pregnant as she has specialised in that & she can help you start a beautiful family \ud83d\ude42 Kudos to your warmth, concern & love towards your patients Dr. Gouri\ud83d\ude42 I\u2019ve found a friend in you \ud83d\ude42",

She is smart, knowledgeable, kind, understanding, modern and a pretty lady! I have found the best Gynaec for the rest of my life! I visited her the first time for my prolactin check in Feb 2023. She prescribed me one medicine for 3 months which was to be taken only at night and guess what it did wonders! My prolactin level came down to the right level within those 3 months! Backstory i was given the same medicine by the other doctor also, but just coz I was not told when and how to take the medicine it did not work! So here is the proof that doctor Gouri knows it all! Later I visited her the second time for my PCOD check and randomly told her about the acne issues I had been facing since my childhood and againnnn she gave me a course of one medicine, which I swear cleared the root cause of my acnes. I had acnes all over my face and would never go, they keep coming back one after the other but after the course given by doctor Gouri, by the end of third month I saw a drastic change and till now I have gotten no active acne on my face. Wait a second it was not just the medicine but I\u2019d like to be really clear that I did follow some diet like cutting off dairy products, fried food and I completely went off sugar. Also as recommended by Doctor Gouri I started having fruits and dry fruits every morning without fail. I visited her the third time again for a problem and I think she has solutions to every problemmmm that I have had till now. You can be as open with her as you want she has no judgements and would give you nothing but the best solutionsss!!! The clinic also has a very smooth process and good vibes. So, don\u2019t think twice before visiting her! She is the best Gynaec you\u2019ll find, trust me!!!",

We thought to ourselves ours is a normal conception so should I even go to her? But then we just ended up going & the very first interaction just felt so wonderful and then we continued & went to her over and over for the rest 9 months \ud83d\ude03. This beautiful lady took utter care of me & my little pea inside throughout my pregnancy just like she would care for a woman with IVF or any other problems \ud83e\udd70. I had a wonderful smooth experience throughout my pregnancy & the warmth that you get from her is just next level \ud83d\ude0d. Her staff are so friendly & well behaved & all sanitization practise was maintained. Her Clinic itself is really well maintained. I strongly strongly 1000% recommend Dr. Gouri to not only woman who have a normal conception but to even woman who have difficulty in getting pregnant as she has specialised in that & she can help you start a beautiful family \ud83d\ude42 Kudos to your warmth, concern & love towards your patients Dr. Gouri\ud83d\ude42 I\u2019ve found a friend in you \ud83d\ude42",

With a history of two failed IUIs, thyroid issue and a low morale, I consulted Dr. Gouri. In the first meeting itself she gave me hope & an action plan to reach the goal.Since then we have successfully overcome all the obstacles and are racing towards success! Dr. Gouri is very approachable & also understands the physical,mental, medical & financial ramifications concerning IVF & does all she can to make it reasonable for the patients.For anyone planning to seek help for pregnancy, I will highly recommend Dr. Gouri Gupta.",

The way she carried out the IUI procedure was also commendable, everything was monitored and done on time. Very few doctors dedicate so much time to a patient.I was suffering from PCOS and undergoing fertility treatments for 2.5 years. Dr. Gauri made it possible within 2 months. For anyone going through similar situations, I would highly recommend her.",

After 3 IUI and 1 IVF failed we were clueless as to whom we should consult for 2nd opinion and during our search we came to know about Dr Gouri. When me met Dr Gouri 1st time we knew that we are in to safe and experience hands. After listing and understanding our case she started treatment. What we like most about her is smiling approach towards every patients and that feels you great when you are in such a emotional journey. She clears all our doubts and even silly one also ( thank you for that doctor\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude1d). She was approachable on phone and whatsapp whenever we need to consult her. \nAnd we are very happy to announce that we successful in our very 1st IVF all because of Dr Gouri\u2019s guidance. We also want to thank her team ( Meenu sister and Harsha sister), they were very nice to us. We will surely recommend Dr Gouri to all the couple who wants to fight with infertility and off course wants to WIN. May god bless you with all the happiness Doctor Gouri.",
