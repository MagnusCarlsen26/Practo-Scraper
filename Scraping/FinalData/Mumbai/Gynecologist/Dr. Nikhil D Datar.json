On his conclusion I approach my organisational hospital and based on Dr Datar sir's conclusion proceed for Rectocele repair.Thank you Datar Sir for your kind information.

                "review_text": "1.5 years ago, we visited a few reputed gynaecologists of Mumbai to choose our doctor. We were not yet pregnant. Our pregnancy was going to be \"high risk pregnancy\" due to a history of late miscarriage at 24 weeks during our previous pregnancy. Having done enough research, our conversations were centred around two topics:\n- identifying the cause of our previous pregnancy loss\n- understanding the plan of action during this pregnancy (to avoid any mishap)\nNot fully satisifed by several renowned gynaecologists, we ended up in the cabin of Dr. Nikhil Datar. And what a fortunate day it was, for we found a doctor who answered all our questions even before we asked them. We were simply listening the entire time. It was evident that he specializes in high-risk pregnancies.\n\nWhen we left his cabin that day, we were smiling ear to ear, for we knew everything is gonna be fine this time because we had Dr. Datar with us. :-)\n\nBefore we started planning again, he got me tested to rule out the causes of earlier miscarriage. Finally, we were down to two - vaginal infection and weak cervix. Both played a crucial role in our pregnancy this time as well.\n\nWhen we got pregnant, he asked me to be extremely vigilant and raise as many alarms as possible. In his own words, \"Feel free to raise 100 alarms. We will address all of them with full rigour. Even if 1 of them is true (rest 99 false) and we are able to address that and avoid a mishap, we would be successful\". During the course of pregnancy, I suffered repeatedly from vaginal infections which were effectively managed by Dr. Datar through minimum medications. At 4 months, there was a sudden drop in the cervical length (from 4cm to 3.2cm within a week). Normal course of action in this case is cervical cerclage. But Dr. Datar managed it by putting me on bedrest for 3 months and administering progesterone tablets and injections. At 6 months I was also diagnosed with gestational diabetes.\n\nGiven all the complications, we were skeptical of crossing the 36 weeks mark, let alone have a normal delivery.\n\nBut miracles do happen! In December 2022, we delivered a healthy baby boy at 38+ weeks through normal vaginal delivery.\n\nUndoubtedly, Dr. Nikhil Datar is the best gynaecologist in whole of Mumbai.\nHe is so experienced yet grounded, has a plethora of knowledge and very clear and systematic approach. On top of that, he is so jolly that he makes you smile even during the toughest situations. I had a laugh or two even during the last stage of contractions.\n\nNo words are sufficient to describe our gratitude for Dr. Nikhil Datar.\n\nP.S.: He is always just a whatsapp text or phone call away!",

                "id": 41338375,
                "review_text": "To begin with, let me give you a brief about our journey of shortlisting the doctor, the 9 months experience and the delivery during COVID-19 pandemic. We had approached Dr. Nihil Datar for our second opinion and that was our best decision taken. Believe me he is a person who will never give you any tension and is always to the point, to the fact in between you get worried that how can things be so normal? He is the best doctor you can approach without any second thought.  \n\nHospital Shortlisting\n\nIt was way back in September 2019, when the news got confirmed we were shortlisting the doctor for safe delivery. We were earlier consulting a doctor, who had a small maternity home. We were the only patient when we used to visit, and we were always asked to get the test and scan done from outside. Which raised a question in mind, whether the hospital has enough facilities to manage emergencies? Even basic scans were also asked to be done from outside. That's when enquired, we decided to shortlist a hospital which has all facilities like NICU, All scans(sonography), paediatrician, dietician, physiotherapist,lactation consultant and all other facilities essential for the pregnant mother and her baby.. (Based on my research NICU is rarely required, but it is better to shortlist an hospital which has this facility, because in case of emergency you do not want to run with the newborn). I stay in Goregaon and hospitals which I shortlisted were Surya (Santacruz), Kokilaben (Andheri) and Cloud9 (Malad). It was obvious for us to go with Cloud9 as it was the nearest and is meant for Gynaecologist cases. \n\nDelivery is a once in a lifetime journey and the 9 months are very crucial. Whenever we used to visit Cloud9, we used to see so many kids, parents and gonna be parents, that it was a pleasant sight to see.\n\nDoctor Shortlisting\n\nOnce the hospital got shortlisted, it was time to shortlist the Dr. Again after enquiring with multiple people and online feedback we decided to consult Dr. Nikhil Datar. He is a very well known doctor in the area and has been practising for quite a long time. He was also referred to us by Dr. Nithya, Vaidya who happens to be our distant relative. When we first met him, we told him about our past medical problems which was a serious concern for us and the way he confidently accepted our case even we became confident that we can complete the 9 Months. \n\n9 Months Experience\n\nWhen you first go for a consultation in Cloud9, you need to download an app, which becomes your reference for the next 9 months and beyond for mother and baby respectively. All appointments, payments and video consultation needs to be done through the app. Once you visit the Dr., normally the Cloud9 team makes you understand the package and gives you an hospital tour.  In our case we used to normally consult Monica, Shraddha and another lady with specs (Sorry I forgot her name) who helped us in understanding the package and the process. They also work to manage appointments on the floor for doctors.\n\nDr. Nikhil is normally assisted by Shraddha and Dr. Vishaka in Cloud 9. Ideally you have a follow up every month in the start and the gap decreases near the pregnancy date. In our very first consultation, Dr. Nikhil provided us with a sheet. This sheet basically has the common symptoms during the 9 months, and the medication to be taken for the same. Initially i thought what is this? But later I realised that this was our handbook. Gynaecologists get emergency at any given time and it is difficult to connect at a single go. So the handbook became our reference point for any general health issues.  During the consultation, Dr. Nikhil was always to the point and used to make us understand everything in detail.\n\nFor our scan/sonography we had consulted Dr. Smita Pawar from Cloud9. Since this was our first child, we always had tension during the scan, that everything should be normal. Dr. Smita was a wonderful lady, who made my wife comfortable and showed us each body part of our baby. Well, the way she used to explain in the scan, we used to eagerly await for the next scan.\n\nDuring the 9 months we are supposed to take some injections and would like to thank the Triage Team for the same. \n\nWhen you register with Cloud9, you basically get a few lamaze sessions and nutritionist sessions complimentary. The physiotherapist Dr. Amruta Nagnoor who comes for your lamaze, is the one who attends you in the IPD too. She will be the one you are gonna thank later if you have a C-Section as she supports you to start walking and post pregnancy exercises. \n\nThe D-Day\n\nOur baby was delivered on 18th May, and it was really a tense moment for us due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Each day the cases were rising up, hospitals getting lockdown and residential buildings being declared as contamination zones. We consulted Dr. Nikhil Datar, and( opted for elective delivery) picked up a date for delivery. It was mandatory for us to get a COVID test done along with other regular tests. COVID test was like an examination test, in which we were relieved only when the result was out. One thing I would like to mention, Cloud9 was providing pick up drop service for all their staff, so that they do not come in contact with an outsider in public transport. This made us feel more assured. \n\nThe entire process of admission was explained to us by Dr. Vishaka very well and she was a call away when we had any query. We got admitted in the morning and were scheduled to operate in the afternoon. I was waiting outside the OT, and was relieved when Dr. Datar came in. Due COVID issue, the hospital did not allow the partner to be inside, but the way my wife explained, there was a team of Dr. and Staff working towards one goal to make the delivery easy. Dr. Datar along with the anaesthetist was actually motivating my wife during the entire process and they safely delivered a daughter for us. Way my wife expressed it to me Dr. Datar had everything under control and the staff were confident since we were his patient. \n\nWe were allotted a room in the 3rd Floor, and would like to thank the entire cleaning staff to name a few Pinky, Rafida and there was another lady who had helped us a lot and motivated my wife and assisted her. Would also like to thank Priya and Anjali sister for guiding us from time to time. And the entire TPA and billing desk team in processing the claim and settling the bill. Billing was perfect and everything we were conveyed by the Cloud9 team was correctly charged with zero complaints. \n\nDuring the stay in the hospital, you are visited by different specialists as part of the package. We had consulted Ms Dipt Shahi for lactation and believe me she knows what she is doing. She might insist you on doing something and that is only for the patient's good. She took out time and solved all our queries. Dr. Amruta Nagnoor (Physiotherapist) is a God, when you have a C-Section. She is the one who wil assist you in making you get up and start walking. Our pediatrician is Dr. Vinay Joshi, who had visited us in the hospital and we have shortlisted him as he was recommended by many too. \n\nThere is a saying by Vince Lomardi (Ex-American Football Coach), \u201cIndividual commitment to a group effort--that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.\u201d. Dr Nikhil Datar and his team are committed to making sure you have an easy delivery. \n\nFew things to make a note:\nGynaecologists always have emergencies, so be patient while you're waiting for the appointment. \nDuring the 9 months journey, there are many times you will have queries. Drop a mail to Dr. Datar, he makes sure he responds to it or acknowledges it. We need to understand Dr. are occupied with patients and operations the entire day.\nRefer the handbook which is bifurcated by trimester for any symptoms. Your query will be resolved there. If not then either call Dr. Vishaka, or Dr. Datar or the best way is to walk into the hospital as there will be someone to attend. \n\nThank you Dr. Datar. \n",

In fact after every appointment we would leave more worried than before.\n\nWe visited Dr.Nikhil Datar to take a second opinion. Zeroed in on him basis the great reviews on various sites. We had to travel around 90 minutes to reach his clinic in malad from our home in bhandup; and we were not really sure if that would work out on an ongoing basis. Given the bad experience with the earlier doctor we were rethinking if the doctor would be worth the time and effort to travel all the way. We decided to give it a shot anyways.\nAnd we are grateful to God that we did. After meeting Dr. Datar for the first time we left feeling positive, upbeat and stress free. \nHere was a Doctor extremely competent but also more importantly genuine, warm and approachable. He had a long line of patients but still took time to answer all our concerns and assuage all our fears.\nAnd from thereon every appointment was a positive and uplifting experience. We had our share of pregnancy issues, minor emergencies but through it all we were assured and relaxed because we, through God\u2019s grace, had Dr. Nikhil Datar on our side to handhold and lead us onward week by week, day by day. He would take all the tension and worry away and keep us upbeat. Must also thank his fantastic team at Cloud Nine hospital Malad. Dr. Datar\u2019s associates Dr. Meghana Shedge and Dr. Urva, our Sonologist Dr. Smita Pawar, everyone  was brilliant! They always paid attention to every detail and scans were done with utmost care and patience and would take time and tell us all the details of both babies and their growth rates. \n\nFinally on the day of delivery we had our lovely twins, Doctor ensured that the babies came out only after 36 weeks and that the babies left with mother, no NICU or any other complications. Recovery from surgery was extremely smooth.\n \n\nFrom thinking at the start to whether this Doctor was worth time and effort to travel 90 minutes to his clinic, to thinking we will visit only this Doctor even if we are to move cities and, finally after delivery the one thought we had was What good deeds have we done to be worthy of a Doctor like him. Its only through God\u2019s grace that we found this Doctor at the right time. Thank you for all the guidance, reassurance and handholding Doctor!",

We are immensely grateful to him for being the guiding light during a pivotal phase of our lives, culminating in the greatest gift we've ever received \u2013 our sweet baby boy.\n\n Our journey with Dr. Datar began during the third month of my wife's pregnancy, shrouded in anxiety about what lay ahead. Our path was far from smooth, riddled with numerous challenges. Upon completion of 6 month of pregnancy, in the scan  fetal growth restriction due to absent end diastolic flow in umbilical artery came to light. Dr Datar managed the situation with great expertise and after some time when the diastolic flow in umbilical artery was reversed, he put my wife under continuous observation and personally monitored the condition of my wife and baby to be born. As soon as he sensed the activity of the baby was not satisfactory, without waiting further he delivered the baby preterm at 30.2 weeks. Now after being in continuous observation in NICU for 44 days the baby got discharged and is with us like a normal child.\n\n Dr. Datar's well-deserved reputation for handling complicated cases was evident throughout our journey. His remarkable ability to instil hope and provide unwavering reassurance at every step kept us moving forward with unwavering faith. What truly sets him apart is his exceptional knack for explaining complex situations with clarity, ensuring we were well-informed. We always felt valued. Dr. Datar's jovial and positive attitude, even amid a demanding schedule, is truly admirable. He never let the gravity of the situation overshadow our hope and positivity.",

Well read on ....\u00a0\nFirst of all people hesitate to even think of going to a male doctor. But I started visiting\u00a0Dr.Nikhil Datar\u00a0since Nov 2015.That was in my 2nd month.\u00a0\nLittle did i know what lies in store for me after meeting this gentleman. He treats you like a friend. Welcomes u in his cabin with a big smile. Asks you how's life and what's going on. Checks you so comfortably. Ensures you that everything looks so good.The baby is doing excellent. Will chat with you and answer your most stupidest questions. Will chat with your husband and check how he is doing (very few people even ask for the husband's well being in those 9months). \u00a0He is a beautiful human being and a doctor who would make sure you smile when u enter his cabin and also leave with a smile\nI was due in May. And i have had nothinf but an amazing experience with this doctor.I dnt think anybody would have had such a smooth 9 months journey to a beautiful and fun filled\u00a0normal delivery inspite of having 5 big complications.\u00a0I had 5 major problems -\u00a0Thyroid, Diabetes (during pregnancy only), Fibroids, Arcurate Uterus and lastly the cord was around my baby's neck in the 38th week.\u00a0Dr.Nikhil was so calm and cool all throughout. He never let me know that all this is actually counted as a complicated caseHe mentioned it only after I was done with my delivery.He just prepared me very well for my delivery and ofcoz a normal one. With so many complications,any doctor would have opted for a C Sec,but for Dr. Nikhil,he never discussed c sec with me at all :) Thank God!\u00a0\nHe is one doctor who would be ur friend, fight for your rights and not let you spend unnecessarily. No doctor would do that today. A genuine and transparent personality for a doctor in this day and age where all are either there to rip your pockets or not really be so involved as a doctor . Must say he is very ethically correct in every way !!!\u00a0\nI dnt think I will ever come across a doctor who gives u so much freedom and let's u enjoy ur pregnancy so much.He rather motivates u to always b happy and enjoy the phase. The comfort he gives to his patients being a male doctor is commendable. I would never go to a female doctor, I have had 2 bad experiences in the first 2 mnths of my pregnancy :(\u00a0\nI would just say, u can close ur eyes and blindly follow Dr. Nikhil Datar pre and post delivery. Post delivery because he would come to your room and share some very logical tips and reasons with your mom for what to follow and what not to.\u00a0Trust me u will be happy following what he says :)\nDr. Nikhil is my God's gift to me...i had 5 PROBLEMS AND HE WAS MY 1 SOULTION.\u00a0\n\nI am truly blessed and will always go to him in the future as well !!!!\u00a0",

This was our first pregnancy and we got reference of Dr. Nikhil Datar from my dermatologist doctor who was consulting him and had a baby few months back. Dr. Datar is the best doctor to have when you have pregnancy with lots of ups and downs. He guided us properly all throughout explaining us the possible scenarios and highlighted the risks but never forced us for any decision. He was always there to solve all our doubts/concerns howsoever big or small they were. Just before the D-day we discussed c-section with him and he gave that comfort and confidence that everything will be fine. And I would say the D-Day was quite smooth. The team of doctors assisting him is very competent and they keep explaining you what is happening in OT all throughout so you feel comfortable and less nervous. So overall experience with the hospital and doctors was very positive and encouraging. We are not from Mumbai and its been just a little over two years in this city. Its only because of Dr. Nikhil Datar and the way he handles everything, his knowledge and competence, that we decided to continue our pregnancy here despite the whole Covid scenario and our parents calling us back home for delivery. We got that faith while consulting Dr. Datar that he would be the **** gynae to consult and in a city which is quite alien for us , we had that constant feeling that we are in safe hands as long as the pregnancy is concerned and that faith has only increased with each visit.

I had multiple fibroids with some measuring almost 15cms in my Abdomen.\nWe consulted 3 Gynecologists for the treatment but were not satisfied with their suggestions. Some were suggesting to get laparoscopic surgery done. \nWe were referred to Dr. Nikhil Datar by a Friend. During our first consultation, On reviewing my reports, he advised and emphasized on getting an Open surgery done for the removal of multiple fibroids. He listened to us calmly, made us comfortable and explained us the procedure about fibroids removal surgery and post surgery facts. After the 1st Consultation itself me and my family, we were convinced to get the surgery done by him. \nThe surgery was done within a month of meeting him.We decided to get the surgery done at Cloudnine Hospital-Malad. The Surgery was successful and fibroids weighing 2.1 kg were removed which is extremely rare for a 34 yr women. Post Surgery on the 2nd day I faced complication of Paralytical ileus. The Doctor explained in detail what was happening, making them calm and comfortable and how I will overcome the complications. I was discharged from the Hospital on the 10th Day of Surgery. The Hospital Staff is very nice and friendly. They took good care of me throughout my stay at Cloudnine Hospital.\n\nDr. Nikhil Datar is always smiling, calm and kept motivating me to get well soon. I resumed work post 1 month of the surgery and feel normal. Ofcourse there is care to be taken for the next 3-4 months.\n\nThank you so much Dr. Nikhil Datar for taking such good care and giving us the right advice for the treatment. \n\nRegards,\nManasi Savla",

                "review_text": "1.5 years ago, we visited a few reputed gynaecologists of Mumbai to choose our doctor. We were not yet pregnant. Our pregnancy was going to be \"high risk pregnancy\" due to a history of late miscarriage at 24 weeks during our previous pregnancy. Having done enough research, our conversations were centred around two topics:\n- identifying the cause of our previous pregnancy loss\n- understanding the plan of action during this pregnancy (to avoid any mishap)\nNot fully satisifed by several renowned gynaecologists, we ended up in the cabin of Dr. Nikhil Datar. And what a fortunate day it was, for we found a doctor who answered all our questions even before we asked them. We were simply listening the entire time. It was evident that he specializes in high-risk pregnancies.\n\nWhen we left his cabin that day, we were smiling ear to ear, for we knew everything is gonna be fine this time because we had Dr. Datar with us. :-)\n\nBefore we started planning again, he got me tested to rule out the causes of earlier miscarriage. Finally, we were down to two - vaginal infection and weak cervix. Both played a crucial role in our pregnancy this time as well.\n\nWhen we got pregnant, he asked me to be extremely vigilant and raise as many alarms as possible. In his own words, \"Feel free to raise 100 alarms. We will address all of them with full rigour. Even if 1 of them is true (rest 99 false) and we are able to address that and avoid a mishap, we would be successful\". During the course of pregnancy, I suffered repeatedly from vaginal infections which were effectively managed by Dr. Datar through minimum medications. At 4 months, there was a sudden drop in the cervical length (from 4cm to 3.2cm within a week). Normal course of action in this case is cervical cerclage. But Dr. Datar managed it by putting me on bedrest for 3 months and administering progesterone tablets and injections. At 6 months I was also diagnosed with gestational diabetes.\n\nGiven all the complications, we were skeptical of crossing the 36 weeks mark, let alone have a normal delivery.\n\nBut miracles do happen! In December 2022, we delivered a healthy baby boy at 38+ weeks through normal vaginal delivery.\n\nUndoubtedly, Dr. Nikhil Datar is the best gynaecologist in whole of Mumbai.\nHe is so experienced yet grounded, has a plethora of knowledge and very clear and systematic approach. On top of that, he is so jolly that he makes you smile even during the toughest situations. I had a laugh or two even during the last stage of contractions.\n\nNo words are sufficient to describe our gratitude for Dr. Nikhil Datar.\n\nP.S.: He is always just a whatsapp text or phone call away!",

                "review_text": "To begin with, let me give you a brief about our journey of shortlisting the doctor, the 9 months experience and the delivery during COVID-19 pandemic. We had approached Dr. Nihil Datar for our second opinion and that was our best decision taken. Believe me he is a person who will never give you any tension and is always to the point, to the fact in between you get worried that how can things be so normal? He is the best doctor you can approach without any second thought.  \n\nHospital Shortlisting\n\nIt was way back in September 2019, when the news got confirmed we were shortlisting the doctor for safe delivery. We were earlier consulting a doctor, who had a small maternity home. We were the only patient when we used to visit, and we were always asked to get the test and scan done from outside. Which raised a question in mind, whether the hospital has enough facilities to manage emergencies? Even basic scans were also asked to be done from outside. That's when enquired, we decided to shortlist a hospital which has all facilities like NICU, All scans(sonography), paediatrician, dietician, physiotherapist,lactation consultant and all other facilities essential for the pregnant mother and her baby.. (Based on my research NICU is rarely required, but it is better to shortlist an hospital which has this facility, because in case of emergency you do not want to run with the newborn). I stay in Goregaon and hospitals which I shortlisted were Surya (Santacruz), Kokilaben (Andheri) and Cloud9 (Malad). It was obvious for us to go with Cloud9 as it was the nearest and is meant for Gynaecologist cases. \n\nDelivery is a once in a lifetime journey and the 9 months are very crucial. Whenever we used to visit Cloud9, we used to see so many kids, parents and gonna be parents, that it was a pleasant sight to see.\n\nDoctor Shortlisting\n\nOnce the hospital got shortlisted, it was time to shortlist the Dr. Again after enquiring with multiple people and online feedback we decided to consult Dr. Nikhil Datar. He is a very well known doctor in the area and has been practising for quite a long time. He was also referred to us by Dr. Nithya, Vaidya who happens to be our distant relative. When we first met him, we told him about our past medical problems which was a serious concern for us and the way he confidently accepted our case even we became confident that we can complete the 9 Months. \n\n9 Months Experience\n\nWhen you first go for a consultation in Cloud9, you need to download an app, which becomes your reference for the next 9 months and beyond for mother and baby respectively. All appointments, payments and video consultation needs to be done through the app. Once you visit the Dr., normally the Cloud9 team makes you understand the package and gives you an hospital tour.  In our case we used to normally consult Monica, Shraddha and another lady with specs (Sorry I forgot her name) who helped us in understanding the package and the process. They also work to manage appointments on the floor for doctors.\n\nDr. Nikhil is normally assisted by Shraddha and Dr. Vishaka in Cloud 9. Ideally you have a follow up every month in the start and the gap decreases near the pregnancy date. In our very first consultation, Dr. Nikhil provided us with a sheet. This sheet basically has the common symptoms during the 9 months, and the medication to be taken for the same. Initially i thought what is this? But later I realised that this was our handbook. Gynaecologists get emergency at any given time and it is difficult to connect at a single go. So the handbook became our reference point for any general health issues.  During the consultation, Dr. Nikhil was always to the point and used to make us understand everything in detail.\n\nFor our scan/sonography we had consulted Dr. Smita Pawar from Cloud9. Since this was our first child, we always had tension during the scan, that everything should be normal. Dr. Smita was a wonderful lady, who made my wife comfortable and showed us each body part of our baby. Well, the way she used to explain in the scan, we used to eagerly await for the next scan.\n\nDuring the 9 months we are supposed to take some injections and would like to thank the Triage Team for the same. \n\nWhen you register with Cloud9, you basically get a few lamaze sessions and nutritionist sessions complimentary. The physiotherapist Dr. Amruta Nagnoor who comes for your lamaze, is the one who attends you in the IPD too. She will be the one you are gonna thank later if you have a C-Section as she supports you to start walking and post pregnancy exercises. \n\nThe D-Day\n\nOur baby was delivered on 18th May, and it was really a tense moment for us due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Each day the cases were rising up, hospitals getting lockdown and residential buildings being declared as contamination zones. We consulted Dr. Nikhil Datar, and( opted for elective delivery) picked up a date for delivery. It was mandatory for us to get a COVID test done along with other regular tests. COVID test was like an examination test, in which we were relieved only when the result was out. One thing I would like to mention, Cloud9 was providing pick up drop service for all their staff, so that they do not come in contact with an outsider in public transport. This made us feel more assured. \n\nThe entire process of admission was explained to us by Dr. Vishaka very well and she was a call away when we had any query. We got admitted in the morning and were scheduled to operate in the afternoon. I was waiting outside the OT, and was relieved when Dr. Datar came in. Due COVID issue, the hospital did not allow the partner to be inside, but the way my wife explained, there was a team of Dr. and Staff working towards one goal to make the delivery easy. Dr. Datar along with the anaesthetist was actually motivating my wife during the entire process and they safely delivered a daughter for us. Way my wife expressed it to me Dr. Datar had everything under control and the staff were confident since we were his patient. \n\nWe were allotted a room in the 3rd Floor, and would like to thank the entire cleaning staff to name a few Pinky, Rafida and there was another lady who had helped us a lot and motivated my wife and assisted her. Would also like to thank Priya and Anjali sister for guiding us from time to time. And the entire TPA and billing desk team in processing the claim and settling the bill. Billing was perfect and everything we were conveyed by the Cloud9 team was correctly charged with zero complaints. \n\nDuring the stay in the hospital, you are visited by different specialists as part of the package. We had consulted Ms Dipt Shahi for lactation and believe me she knows what she is doing. She might insist you on doing something and that is only for the patient's good. She took out time and solved all our queries. Dr. Amruta Nagnoor (Physiotherapist) is a God, when you have a C-Section. She is the one who wil assist you in making you get up and start walking. Our pediatrician is Dr. Vinay Joshi, who had visited us in the hospital and we have shortlisted him as he was recommended by many too. \n\nThere is a saying by Vince Lomardi (Ex-American Football Coach), \u201cIndividual commitment to a group effort--that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.\u201d. Dr Nikhil Datar and his team are committed to making sure you have an easy delivery. \n\nFew things to make a note:\nGynaecologists always have emergencies, so be patient while you're waiting for the appointment. \nDuring the 9 months journey, there are many times you will have queries. Drop a mail to Dr. Datar, he makes sure he responds to it or acknowledges it. We need to understand Dr. are occupied with patients and operations the entire day.\nRefer the handbook which is bifurcated by trimester for any symptoms. Your query will be resolved there. If not then either call Dr. Vishaka, or Dr. Datar or the best way is to walk into the hospital as there will be someone to attend. \n\nThank you Dr. Datar. \n",

In fact after every appointment we would leave more worried than before.\n\nWe visited Dr.Nikhil Datar to take a second opinion. Zeroed in on him basis the great reviews on various sites. We had to travel around 90 minutes to reach his clinic in malad from our home in bhandup; and we were not really sure if that would work out on an ongoing basis. Given the bad experience with the earlier doctor we were rethinking if the doctor would be worth the time and effort to travel all the way. We decided to give it a shot anyways.\nAnd we are grateful to God that we did. After meeting Dr. Datar for the first time we left feeling positive, upbeat and stress free. \nHere was a Doctor extremely competent but also more importantly genuine, warm and approachable. He had a long line of patients but still took time to answer all our concerns and assuage all our fears.\nAnd from thereon every appointment was a positive and uplifting experience. We had our share of pregnancy issues, minor emergencies but through it all we were assured and relaxed because we, through God\u2019s grace, had Dr. Nikhil Datar on our side to handhold and lead us onward week by week, day by day. He would take all the tension and worry away and keep us upbeat. Must also thank his fantastic team at Cloud Nine hospital Malad. Dr. Datar\u2019s associates Dr. Meghana Shedge and Dr. Urva, our Sonologist Dr. Smita Pawar, everyone  was brilliant! They always paid attention to every detail and scans were done with utmost care and patience and would take time and tell us all the details of both babies and their growth rates. \n\nFinally on the day of delivery we had our lovely twins, Doctor ensured that the babies came out only after 36 weeks and that the babies left with mother, no NICU or any other complications. Recovery from surgery was extremely smooth.\n \n\nFrom thinking at the start to whether this Doctor was worth time and effort to travel 90 minutes to his clinic, to thinking we will visit only this Doctor even if we are to move cities and, finally after delivery the one thought we had was What good deeds have we done to be worthy of a Doctor like him. Its only through God\u2019s grace that we found this Doctor at the right time. Thank you for all the guidance, reassurance and handholding Doctor!",

We are immensely grateful to him for being the guiding light during a pivotal phase of our lives, culminating in the greatest gift we've ever received \u2013 our sweet baby boy.\n\n Our journey with Dr. Datar began during the third month of my wife's pregnancy, shrouded in anxiety about what lay ahead. Our path was far from smooth, riddled with numerous challenges. Upon completion of 6 month of pregnancy, in the scan  fetal growth restriction due to absent end diastolic flow in umbilical artery came to light. Dr Datar managed the situation with great expertise and after some time when the diastolic flow in umbilical artery was reversed, he put my wife under continuous observation and personally monitored the condition of my wife and baby to be born. As soon as he sensed the activity of the baby was not satisfactory, without waiting further he delivered the baby preterm at 30.2 weeks. Now after being in continuous observation in NICU for 44 days the baby got discharged and is with us like a normal child.\n\n Dr. Datar's well-deserved reputation for handling complicated cases was evident throughout our journey. His remarkable ability to instil hope and provide unwavering reassurance at every step kept us moving forward with unwavering faith. What truly sets him apart is his exceptional knack for explaining complex situations with clarity, ensuring we were well-informed. We always felt valued. Dr. Datar's jovial and positive attitude, even amid a demanding schedule, is truly admirable. He never let the gravity of the situation overshadow our hope and positivity.",

Well read on ....\u00a0\nFirst of all people hesitate to even think of going to a male doctor. But I started visiting\u00a0Dr.Nikhil Datar\u00a0since Nov 2015.That was in my 2nd month.\u00a0\nLittle did i know what lies in store for me after meeting this gentleman. He treats you like a friend. Welcomes u in his cabin with a big smile. Asks you how's life and what's going on. Checks you so comfortably. Ensures you that everything looks so good.The baby is doing excellent. Will chat with you and answer your most stupidest questions. Will chat with your husband and check how he is doing (very few people even ask for the husband's well being in those 9months). \u00a0He is a beautiful human being and a doctor who would make sure you smile when u enter his cabin and also leave with a smile\nI was due in May. And i have had nothinf but an amazing experience with this doctor.I dnt think anybody would have had such a smooth 9 months journey to a beautiful and fun filled\u00a0normal delivery inspite of having 5 big complications.\u00a0I had 5 major problems -\u00a0Thyroid, Diabetes (during pregnancy only), Fibroids, Arcurate Uterus and lastly the cord was around my baby's neck in the 38th week.\u00a0Dr.Nikhil was so calm and cool all throughout. He never let me know that all this is actually counted as a complicated caseHe mentioned it only after I was done with my delivery.He just prepared me very well for my delivery and ofcoz a normal one. With so many complications,any doctor would have opted for a C Sec,but for Dr. Nikhil,he never discussed c sec with me at all :) Thank God!\u00a0\nHe is one doctor who would be ur friend, fight for your rights and not let you spend unnecessarily. No doctor would do that today. A genuine and transparent personality for a doctor in this day and age where all are either there to rip your pockets or not really be so involved as a doctor . Must say he is very ethically correct in every way !!!\u00a0\nI dnt think I will ever come across a doctor who gives u so much freedom and let's u enjoy ur pregnancy so much.He rather motivates u to always b happy and enjoy the phase. The comfort he gives to his patients being a male doctor is commendable. I would never go to a female doctor, I have had 2 bad experiences in the first 2 mnths of my pregnancy :(\u00a0\nI would just say, u can close ur eyes and blindly follow Dr. Nikhil Datar pre and post delivery. Post delivery because he would come to your room and share some very logical tips and reasons with your mom for what to follow and what not to.\u00a0Trust me u will be happy following what he says :)\nDr. Nikhil is my God's gift to me...i had 5 PROBLEMS AND HE WAS MY 1 SOULTION.\u00a0\n\nI am truly blessed and will always go to him in the future as well !!!!\u00a0",

This was our first pregnancy and we got reference of Dr. Nikhil Datar from my dermatologist doctor who was consulting him and had a baby few months back. Dr. Datar is the best doctor to have when you have pregnancy with lots of ups and downs. He guided us properly all throughout explaining us the possible scenarios and highlighted the risks but never forced us for any decision. He was always there to solve all our doubts/concerns howsoever big or small they were. Just before the D-day we discussed c-section with him and he gave that comfort and confidence that everything will be fine. And I would say the D-Day was quite smooth. The team of doctors assisting him is very competent and they keep explaining you what is happening in OT all throughout so you feel comfortable and less nervous. So overall experience with the hospital and doctors was very positive and encouraging. We are not from Mumbai and its been just a little over two years in this city. Its only because of Dr. Nikhil Datar and the way he handles everything, his knowledge and competence, that we decided to continue our pregnancy here despite the whole Covid scenario and our parents calling us back home for delivery. We got that faith while consulting Dr. Datar that he would be the **** gynae to consult and in a city which is quite alien for us , we had that constant feeling that we are in safe hands as long as the pregnancy is concerned and that faith has only increased with each visit.

I had multiple fibroids with some measuring almost 15cms in my Abdomen.\nWe consulted 3 Gynecologists for the treatment but were not satisfied with their suggestions. Some were suggesting to get laparoscopic surgery done. \nWe were referred to Dr. Nikhil Datar by a Friend. During our first consultation, On reviewing my reports, he advised and emphasized on getting an Open surgery done for the removal of multiple fibroids. He listened to us calmly, made us comfortable and explained us the procedure about fibroids removal surgery and post surgery facts. After the 1st Consultation itself me and my family, we were convinced to get the surgery done by him. \nThe surgery was done within a month of meeting him.We decided to get the surgery done at Cloudnine Hospital-Malad. The Surgery was successful and fibroids weighing 2.1 kg were removed which is extremely rare for a 34 yr women. Post Surgery on the 2nd day I faced complication of Paralytical ileus. The Doctor explained in detail what was happening, making them calm and comfortable and how I will overcome the complications. I was discharged from the Hospital on the 10th Day of Surgery. The Hospital Staff is very nice and friendly. They took good care of me throughout my stay at Cloudnine Hospital.\n\nDr. Nikhil Datar is always smiling, calm and kept motivating me to get well soon. I resumed work post 1 month of the surgery and feel normal. Ofcourse there is care to be taken for the next 3-4 months.\n\nThank you so much Dr. Nikhil Datar for taking such good care and giving us the right advice for the treatment. \n\nRegards,\nManasi Savla",

The general fear that most women have about a male gynecologist was surely something that Dr Nikhil will help you overcome. We never felt uncomfortable with Dr Nikhil during our entire course of the pregnancy. He is an extremely kind and down to earth doctor who is well experienced and has a plethora of knowledge in his field of expertise. Throughout our pregnancy we were guided and assured that everything was going to be Ok. Dr Nikhil understood and explained all our doubts/ queries in lay man's terms so that we as parents were aware of what was going on with our pregnancy and our baby.We were always sceptical of having a c section as the recovery period for us would be longer, and the term 'Surgery' is something that always made us worry about. Dr Nikhil assured us that we would try our best for a normal delivery and only when he was sure that my breech baby wouldn't turn at all were we advised for a c section.During the procedure Dr Nikhil, used his experience and expertise to deliver my baby girl - who was having a double loop of cord around her neck, with the utmost care. We are pleased to say that the procedure was quick and efficient due to Dr Nikhil's years of experience. Post the delivery in the hospital Dr Nikhil visited us daily and checked on us, explaining the post delivery recovery period and precautions that we need to take.We are thankful to Dr Nikhil for all his help and we would definitely recommend him to anyone.  We are also grateful to the entire Cloudnine team for their help.",

Through references of family and friends, I decided on going to a female gynaec close to my residence.\n\nI came to know about my pregnancy sometime in April, 2020 when the entire world was under LockDown due to the Corona Virus Pandemic. This put restrictions on movement and so we went ahead with the nearest choice. \n\nThis being my first pregnancy, I had a lot of questions in my mind for which I was seeking answers. Unfortunately, I did not connect well with the female gynaec that I chose and so my expectations about having a good rapport and friendly interactions did not become reality. I was not at all comfortable and with each visit I was assured I need to change. Also, they allowed only the patient in and so the husband was kept in the dark if he had any questions to ask.\n\nWe started looking out for other gynaecs through references. We came across CloudNine Hospital at Malad which had a panel of gynaecs. I thought of going in for a male gynaec (although I could chose a female from the panel) and that's when we thought of first approaching Dr. Nikhil Datar. We had spoken to a couple of our friends / relatives about Dr. Datar. \n\nAt CloudNine, one person was allowed with the patient. On our first visit, our first question was about the distance between Borivali and Makar and how that can be handled. Dr. Datar gave us so much comfort that it made our decision easier. We got answers to all our questions and I did not hesitate or shy away even once. He cleared all our doubts through his YouTube videos. I got a pool of information which is what I was seeking.\n\nAt every visit, I listed down what qts I had in mind. But I never ever had to ask. It was like he could read my mind. He always encouraged me to excercise at every point and motivated me that I was a fit case for normal delivery.\n\nBut as God had it planned for me, I had to do a C Sec. On the D Day in the OT, I couldn't for once make out he is the Dr who was to do my surgery. He was so calm and cool. The qt he asked me drove away all my worries. He said \"You look worried to me. Let's play some music of your choice.\" \n\nI would say a super cool and go-to gynaec which I was looking out for.",

But we failed to derive confidence in their 5 mins of hurried consultation and lack of guidance on pregnancy related issues.\n\nFortunately one day a friend suggested Dr. Datar of Cloudnine. We decided to take his appointment. When we entered there we saw the assistant doctors, and the reception staff mentioned him with an unparalleled reverence and when I met him I understood why. \n\nHis unique approach is filled with words of wisdom, a lot of humour, Care and Good guidance. When we came out of our first consultation after spending 45 minutes with him, I really stopped feeling like a patient. He made me believe that  pregnancy is a beautiful phase. Even though cloud nine is little far from our home, We immediately registered for delivery, as we wanted only Dr. Datar to deliver. \n\nHe also taught us various things including No panick strategy, how to respond to symptoms when the due date is near, what to eat, various myths and notions of birthing.\n\nDr datar\u2019s continuous guidance helped me keep calm during the entire delivery process and I delivered a beautiful baby girl. All that knowledge he imparted really helped us before and after delivery. Both me and my husband are really great ful to him for all his support and kindness. \n\nP.S. I would like to specially mention this that during the day of my delivery he was himself little unwell, but Inspite of that he kept motivating me on the OT table and helped me deliver a wonderful  baby girl. Now I truly believe that Doctors are indeed Angels.",

And the ob gyn we consulted with initially, was a great doctor, but put me on a redder level of alert making me give up all forms of exercise and expect the untoward at any time. My partner and I went to Dr Datar for a second opinion after hearing of his expertise from friends and decided to stick to him not just for his professionalism but also for the calm and positive manner in which he handled all our questions and concerns. \n\nWe were also drawn to the fact that he is also a lawyer involved in women\u2019 health and reproductive rights issues - as a lawyer myself that was the clincher:)\n\nHe encouraged an active lifestyle and always provided proper and practical advice with a wide smile. Even where there were some complications in the pregnancy he gave us all the information and helped us make informed decisions. \n\nI was hoping for and had worked very hard to have a natural delivery and Dr Datar encouraged it. When my labour did not progress as expected and we had to decide for an emergency c section midway I was upset. Dr Datar\u2019s words were reassuring when he said that it\u2019s simply nature\u2019s way of telling us to take help of medical science. And the c section procedure itself was like watching a highly trained orchestra performing. Everything was clinically sterile and yet, it was smooth, peaceful and everyone was simply great at what they were doing. I don\u2019t know if the hormones and the drugs were getting me happy high but I though someone was even humming a tune next to me! And Doc brought us our little turnip in no time:)) \n\nI expected to be fragile for a long time after the surgery. And truthfully, the surgery took a heavy toll both physically and mentally for a few days which is expected,  but I recovered from the surgery pretty quickly and am on the way to full recovery over the next few months. \n\nWe\u2019re thankful to Dr Datar and his great team at Cloud Nine Hospital Malad for making our journey enjoyable and rewarding.

I would land up at the hospital hoping to be examined and reassured that nothing was wrong. When everyone thought I was being too cautious, my doctor understood. Finding a doctor good at his/ her skill is easy; finding a doctor who cares and understands his patients is rare. He is the right blend of caring, humorous and professional. Dr. Datar would patiently answer all questions, my husband and I would have, without any rush. Just by meeting him, you feel calm and reassured. I would always look forward to my appointments with him. The best part about Dr. Datar is that he is always reachable and extremely prompt at answering your emails. This was very important to me. \n\nFour reasons I would strongly recommend him:-\n\n1.\tHe is completely at ease with the fact that millennials today will Google, read up a lot & have many questions; he would patiently answer through our list of questions during every visit.\n2.\tHe does not push for unnecessary tests or procedures, and spends enough time explaining why/ when one needs to and need not, thus offering us an informed choice.\n3.\tHe is always reachable \u2013 through phone or email.\n4.\tHe helps you understand the various birth plan options and supports you with your choice!\n",

My hope was never turned down and I always came out smiling and happy from his cabin. \nHe was not just my doctor, he was my guide, my mentor, a friend, a God Father....\nDoctors are the face of God, I had only heard it, but experienced it too in last 9 months.\nA super energetic doctor reflecting positive vibes, prescribing least medicines, motivating me to work out, treat myself, travel, enjoy life and the phase and take care of myself...  He cultivates healthy habits in his pregnant women and I loved his dialogue - 'i want my women to be hot moms, not fat moms'\nI have a severe phobia of blood & pain and delivery is all about pain and blood. Neither myself nor my family ever thought that I could deliver naturally, but Dr Datar's confidence in natural delivery helped me accomplish the task.\nWe decided to deliver our baby in Bombay despite the odds of difficulty with support since our families do not live in bombay, only for Dr.Datar and he never disappointed us.\nThroughout my pregnancy, he promoted natural delivery and motivated me to prepare for the marathon saying I can do it if I want to do it and I should not think about cesarean at all. He was always very transparent with his advise, and never gave a wrong one. \nHe did what he promised, and all the Lamaze, diet control, exercises and positive mental strength helped me in delivering a  healthy baby naturally.\nCloud9 services are definitely appreciable and the other doctors and team are awesome as well.\n\nAll thanks to Dr.Datar and team (including Dr.Meghna, Dr.Piyush, Dr.Atrye and all the other Cloud9 staff) \n\n",

I was going through very negative & tense full mind!! Then we decided to visit Dr. Nikhil Datar.\nTotally impressed by the way I was treated first time when I met Dr Nikhil Datar and the way he followed up. His joyous, funny nature and ever smiling personality puts patients at ease. He is an extraordinary intelligent Doctor with human values. He explains everything in detail and caters to all our doubts patiently.\nIn the first meeting itself doctor briefed us about the issue and what is to be done and surgery was the final conclusion. It's the comfort and assurance by the doctor himself that we decided to go for the surgery. This was my first operation. But after meeting and consulting with doctor, my all stress went off and I happily entered the OT. You will feel satisfied and rest assured you are in safe hands. \nChoosing Dr Nikhil Datar proved to be the best decision ever!! I strongly recommend him to everyone.  \nI feel so blessed & lucky to known him. I am very thankful to him and wish him all the very best. Always smile :)\nAlso thankful to his team as well.\n\nWarm Regards,\nMr & Mrs Prachi Shashank Kotkar",

However I got over the incident and decided to take a brave step of trying for a baby. I decided to consult a doctor in cloudnine malad to seek opinion on the way forward. Based on reviews, I chose Dr. Nikhil Datar. I consulted Dr.Datar in November 2021, and after meeting him gained confidence and hope that I could get pregnant. I conceived in June 2022 and chose Dr.Datar to be my doctor. He took all precautions from day 1 and ensured that I would deliver a full term baby. I trusted Dr.Datar , my body and I sailed through the 9 months smoothly. His words during check-ups - \"Yes, tell me\", \"everything is fantastic\", \"Your doing great\" etc, itself were so comforting and would boost my confidence. We were blessed with a healthy baby boy early March 2023. Thankyou Dr.Datar for making my journey of 9 months memorable and for our little blessing.",

What struck us most was that he empowered us with very clear and relevant information about our options and made us feel part of one team.\n\nAlso must call out his jovial and positive attitude (despite a long and busy schedule!) which is so infectious :)\n\nPersonally, I admire all the wonderful work he is doing for Women's rights outside of the clinic.\n\nMany thanks again to Dr Datar and his team :) ",

With inputs and instructions pouring in from everyone, Dr Datar gives logical reasoning and guidance. \nWe are so grateful to him for encouraging us for Normal vaginal delivery. We were concerned that if we can have natural delivery as baby had cord around the neck, however even after this complication I had natural delivery and it was only possible because of Dr Datar. Not to forget he has an excellent sense of humour and even in stressful situation he made sure we are relaxed. \nFacilities and support staff at Cloud Nine are also excellent! \nWe can\u2019t thank him enough for making this journey a memorable one.

Almost all the obs/gynaec related issues in our family have been handled by him (and before him by his mom Dr Sudha Datar). So when it came to my second pregnancy, my obvious choice was him. More so because I am a diabetic (it was an unplanned pregnancy and i was on oral hypoglycemic medicines when I conceived, which made this a high risk case) and did not want to take any chances with the medical care required.    The best thing that strikes me about Dr Datar is that he is a perfect blend of a highly competent medical professional and a fantastic human being. His line of treatment always starts with a smile, which assures you that u r in right hands and everything is gonna work out. Right through my pregnancy, he made sure that I was getting required medical attention both for my diabetes as well proper growth of my baby. It is completely due to his support that I delivered a perfectly healthy and normal baby boy. I would recommend Dr Nikhil Datar's name to everyone seeking best pre and post pregnancy care. ",

Here was this  man personally checking on me even though he had to leave. \nThe reviews I read earlier from other patients are definitely right in what they said... \nFor me I had a choice of many best gynecologists at the hospital ofcrse he being one of them, what made me go to him and I really would say he is a beautiful soul first and that's important to me. \nI am further following up with him and would recommend other people you could definitely trust on him. Thank you Dr, you are a real gem of person.. ",

He used to answer all my questions patiently. Like other doctors, he was never in hurry to wrap up fast. If there is any complication, he explains the problem and its solution properly in simple language. He never advises unnecessary tests and scans. His advice is always very reasonable and practical. He is always in happy mood, full of optimism and enthusiasm! \n\nI am very grateful and obliged to Dr. Datar for giving me an opportunity to deliver my baby normally, unlike other gynaecologist who hunt for some or the other excuse to make a case of C section. Dr. Nikhil Datar is not only a genius gynaecologist but a very good human being! He is like an elder brother to me!\n\nDuring labor, no doubt there is unbearable excruciating pain but immediately after delivery I felt as if I have not delivered at all! Right the next day, I became completely normal and was able to live my normal life and do my normal day to day household works. In all, ** ********** ** ****** ******** ******* *** ********** ***** ** *** ****** ***** *** ********* *** *** **** ********* ******* ** ** **** **** ***** From heart, I wish Dr. Datar a very happy, healthy and peaceful life ahead!\n",

Dr said that first we will do some test and then decide whether to conceive or not.... But by God grace all tests were normal and the second journey started. Each n every month, slowly n steadily with help of them finally I successfully  completed my journey of pregnancy without any complications just because of Dr Datar sir... This is nothing but like Miracle... As everyone knows that  if you have history of eclampsia  then there are more chances for negative outcome. \nSir always explains each n every thing as it is (Cristal clear) .Most important sir never recommended any unnecessary test or even a single tablet which is unnecessary because they are very much confident in each n every case. So I'm always be thankful to you sir and all Yashada team.\n Once you  visit to Datar sir for any maternity  related or gynac  problem  then sure shot you have taken the most important wise decision....Thanks a lot sir.

This was the first time we met Nikhil Sir; he tried his level best but could not stop the baby from delivering the very same day. As baby was born in 26 weeks so he had multiple complication and could only survive for 23 days in NICU unit of Cloudnine. With the experience we had with Cloudnine, next time when we were expecting again, we immediately consulted Nikhil Sir. Under his guidance and supervision this time it was full-term pregnancy and ended up having a normal delivery with a healthy baby. Was discharged on 3rd day since everything was normal.

Just on physical examination doctor told me that my uterine fibroids have grown quiet a bit and asked me not to delay and get an ultrasound done. \nI went for a USG immediately and the Sonologist confirmed that I need to treat these fibroids at the earliest as they were multiple, big in size and affecting other organs. \nFor a person who\u2019s never been hospitalised I was petrified however doctor made the whole process a cake walk. Not scaring me yet at the same time explaining me the gravity of the situation. \nIt was luck and the good sense that prevailed upon me that time to come to Dr. Nikhil. He suggested an open myomectomy and due his expertise a surprise fibroid was found behind the uterus which wasn\u2019t showing in the USG SCAN also and it was the largest in size of the 11 fibroids that were surgically removed. \nI shall be eternally thankful to Dr. Nikhil for getting me through this. It was only because of  my doctor that this journey was easy and stress free. \nThanks a billion Doctor \ud83d\ude4f \nP.S. never met a doctor with a such a good sense of humour who made sure that even on the OT table the mood is light \ud83e\udd17\n\nWarm regards,\nReema Chopra  ",

Dr. Datar is extremely positive, jovial, practical, has a great sense of humour, has extensive knowledge about his specialisation, is available to answer any questions when needed, is able to ease any worry you may have and is absolutely wonderful at his job. My husband wasn't available for 2/3rd of my pregnancy, but I was able to stay calm and relax throughout my pregnancy because I knew I had the best to attend to me. He never made me feel silly with the smallest of questions I had, never judged me and ensured I felt safe. I always look forward to my visits with him and today I have a beautiful baby boy with absolute ease and calm. I recommend Dr. Datar to anyone who needs to feel safe n yet needs a modern day approach to a happy and easy experience of pregnancy and delivery.",

He never gave me \u2018gyaan\u2019 on my biological clock ticking etc. He wasn\u2019t intrusive and yet happy to explain things in detail.\n\nAfter some years, my husband and I were ready to have a baby. I was pretty stressed out in general at that time and guess what, he actually asked me not to visit for 2-3 months, destress a bit and come back to discuss next steps. And I naturally conceived the next time I visited him. I was gunning for a natural delivery and he supported me throughout. He would give us just the right guidance without being overbearing. His big smile and sense of humour always lightened up our mood. I particularly remember that despite a personal loss, he was smiling and taking all my queries patiently. He is just amazingly professional. \n\nI had a natural delivery - vacuum assisted and my recovery was smooth and quick. He and his entire team at Cloudnine were amazing throughout delivery and post delivery. Dr. Datar is not just a fantastic  doc but a wonderful human being. A rare find. I can\u2019t thank him enough.

At the same time he was very detailed and methodical in educating me of the various aspects and options of my pregnancy.\n\nHis consulting room never had an awkward or inhibited moment because of his friendly and upbeat demeanour.\n\nHis acumen in taking a decision that suits the health of the mother and baby during complications in labour is what helped avoid a c-section in my case. I will always be grateful that he made a normal and safe delivery and a speedy recovery possible for me. \n\nI was fortunate that my health was in such safe and capable hands.

If you\u2019re looking for a doctor with the balance of personal care and thorough professional expertise, look no further.\n\nFrom our very first meeting, my husband and I both were at ease with Dr Datar\u2019s contagious smile and humour. He explained each milestone and put our fears to rest. With google and various apps, it is very easy to get confused and no one really shares positive stories. Dr Datars logical reasoning is the reason our pregnancy has been so joyful. He held our hands every step of the way, and gave us confidence that we will eventually become parents.\nHe motivated me to continue working and be active throughout my pregnancy. He encouraged us for natural delivery and motivated me throughout my labour. It is because of his encouragement I had a smooth labour and delivered a healthy baby. \n\nDr Datar sincerely cares about you as an individual. His passion and experience speaks through his professional care. Apart from being a fantastic doctor, he is a wonderful human being too. He does a lot of social work and fights for women. \n\nMy husband and I cannot thank him enough for what he has done for our family and what he continues to do for society. \n",

He is one of the most genuine doctor and comes across as a great human being too.\nIt being my first time, I was obviously anxious, full of doubts and confusion but Dr. Datar would patiently answer the silliest of my questions. He takes time to listen to the patients and really understands their wishes. With guidance and instructions pouring from all sides, and with confusing opinions on Google about what to eat,what not eat, how to travel, how to sleep etc, one would always end up in doubt. However, Dr Datar is very logical and reasonable in his approach.  He lightens the mood the moment you enter the cabin and puts you at ease.\nDespite few complications during my pregnancy like fibroid, blood clot etc, Dr Datar helped me remain positive and gave me the confidence to believe that pregnancy is all about wellness and not illness. \nHe is also a women activist and it is amazing to see how he manages his busy schedule and his commitment to give back to the society with so much grace. \nTo me and my husband he was a God sent angel and we will always remain indebted to him to let me cherish the best 9 months of my life.\nThank you Dr Nikhil Datar! You are amazing! ",

I wanted a doctor who would not scare me just because I was pregnant and say things like you can't do this, you can't eat this, you can't go there etc.  (usually your families and people around are enough to do so). I wanted a happy pregnancy :). After meeting multiple doctors I met Dr. Nikhil Datar who lets you be. He answers all the queries, doesnt let you panic, comforts you in all the situations, while also informing you of all the pros and cons of every upcoming situation. He also listens to smallest and silliest of your concerns and helps you through (like the leg cramps, bleeding gums etc.) instead of shooting them down.  He will also help you make an informed decision and explain every single issue/ report/ test etc. (He  did that while i was overdue (in my 41st week) and instructed us to get induced and not wait any more as the tests weren't up to the mark. I delivered a baby girl the next day normally :)) So, if you want a happy go lucky doc and want to be in good hands at the same time, look no further. Thanks a ton Doc :)",

First visit itself me and my family were sure that we made a right decision. Every visit he would keep us in loop of everything that\u2019s happening and never ever rushes with the appointment. He is happy to answer all your doubts even if it\u2019s the silliest. My entire pregnancy went smooth & my delivery was normal. Not only is he amazing but even his team is equally good.\n\nI would request you to keep your inhibition aside & just meet him once. ** ** *** **** ****** *** *** ***** There is a MYTH about him that he is not reachable. Please DO NOT believe in it. He might not be able to take calls because most of the time he is with patients or in OT but he is available on mails. Not once during my pregnancy I must have had difficulty in reaching him. In fact when I went in labor at 11:30pm I mailed him & he was there in no time.\n\n\nYour pregnancy is the most beautiful, precious & sensitive experience. I would request you to trust & give it in Safe Hands- Dr.Nikhil Dattar is that Safe hands.\n\n",

From the onset i was suffering from Nausea, Vomitting cramps and later on gestational diabetes and High Blood pressure. But the moment  we walked into Dr. Datar's Cabin we knew we were in safe hands.  Dr Datar handled my pregnancy and my nature beautifully and brilliantly. I am worrisome and pessimist by nature. For me if something can go wrong will go wrong. Dr. Datar was one of the most approachable, kind, patient Dr. I have ever met, and so skilled at this craft. He handheld me  thruout my pregnancy and put me totally at ease. He would patiently hear me out , my fears, complains and unnecessary worries and no question that i asked was trivial or unimportant and none that of them went unanswered. Dr Datar ** * ****** *******  *** **** importantly he is a good human being with a great humor and  patience. We cant thank him enough for helping us in the beautiful journey of parenthood and helping us bring our bundle of joy in this world",

An amazing doctor and more so an awesome human being. I have never come across a doctor like him. He definitely put me to ease everytime i visited him and is a strong believer of normal delivery which has become very uncommon these days. He was always very patient to answer all my queries and never rushed, no matter how many patients were lined up. Ladies, please do not hesitate to go to a male gynaec, especially Dr Datar! I would strongly recommend him. My entire journey (though only 3 months with him) was wonderful and I couldnt thank him enough for being such a wonderful doctor. I had a normal delivery and all thanks to him and also his assistant dr Meghna for being there throughout and making sure my baby and I were completely fine. He was more of a mentor than a doctor who makes you very comfortable from the time you visit him. I decided to visit him only by reading all the reviews on various blogs and i am glad i chose him to start this beautiful journey of motherhood! Thanks a lot again and god bless you and your entire team! ",

This social stigma is still prevalent and hence male gynaecologists have to face lots of troubles while treating their patients. I talk about this because I too had such stereotyping in me and I did think twice before visiting Dr. Nikhil Datar.\nBut let me also tell you that my baby was delivered by Dr. Nikhil and my wife is very happy about everything and both mom and baby are healthy.\n\nI am here to help you stop thinking twice before meeting this Doctor (\"Male Gynaecologist\"). The very first time we met him, he talked through each and every details which made me and my wife very comfortable. Obviously, he brings in lots of experience in his field but before a good doctor he is a very good person which is evident from the very first meeting. I am really thankful that I met him and never thought again to take a second opinion.\n\nI do not hope that this review will remove the complete stigma but even if it reduces it, we all will be able to get good treatments even from great Male Gynaecologist/Obstetrician like Dr. Nikhil Datar.",

After going through all reviews online, I visited Dr Nikhil Datar when I was two months pregnant. On the first visit itself me and my husband  were confident that we want Dr Nikhil as our Gynac and it was our best decision. Lot of restrictions are imposed on a pregnant women and it is specially difficult to follow all those restrictions for a working women but due to Dr Nikhil and all his vedios on youtube and instagram by taking adequate precautions, I was able to lead a normal life and was able to work till end of the preganancy. These kind of information is exceptional and by following some simple steps women can actually enjoy her preganancy. Also right at the beginning I was provided a booklet which actually gives a road map for 9 months which I found very helpful throughout my preganancy which included medications to be taken in case of illness, scans to be done in subsequent weeks of preganancy, red alerts where doctor needs to be approached immediately etc . I actually enjoyed my preganancy and it was majorly due to Doctor I opted for! Every time I visited him, I felt confident and it was because of his understanding and early evaluation helped me forsee and prepare for what was to come next. ",

His style of simplified explanation and transparency about treatments under given scenario are really appreciative.\n\nThere are not enough words to describe how thankful we are for his wonderful care during my wife\u2019s pregnancy, labor & delivery. Because of his professionalism and great smiles, we felt like we were in good hands and that gave us peace of mind towards the big day. Also it is because of his concern and expertise that we had an unremarkable pregnancy and my wife carried to full term.

It recurred this year and a decision was made to have a hysterectomy. I was told about my options and was advised rightly about which was preferable and why. I followed Dr. Datar's advice and everything went smoothly. Post operative advice was specific and the online consultation was quite handy. Replies were quick and within 24 hours. I can say that the treatment I received was great and the service in the nursing home with the staff was up to the mark. My gratitude and thanks to Dr. Datar and their staff for helping me through this.",

Doctor explained every bit of it and kept us informed about all milestones. Every time we met him we came out happy and confident. \n\nHe is not only a great doctor but also a wonderful person full of energy. Every time you meet him his positivity makes you comfortable and your half worries are sorted upon just meeting him. \n\nI'm glad I met Dr. Nikhil and I will definitely recommend him to all expecting moms out there\u2026!!! \n\nThanks a lot doctor for your support\u2026!",

Dr Nikhil is exactly that kind of doctor. He not only respected my birth plan of having as natural a delivery as possible but also guided me throughout labor so I could stick to it. \n\nWhen my friend first recommended him, I was a little hesitant to consult a male gynecologist. However after the first meeting itself I got the confidence that I was with one of the best doctors. I would strongly recommend him!",

But we in India don't like that too. We like to have same doctor everywhere and every time. And that is humanly impossible to achieve all the time.\nSo I am sorry that you were disappointed.

His relax and easy way of explaining things helps to manage your tension and anxiety. ",

He answered patiently every question that I had in my mind. In first consultation itself I gained the confidence and courage. Without any fear I underwent the operation within a week. Dr. Datar is a down to earth person with friendly and humorous nature. His knowledge and experience in the subject matter is unquestionable.  His entire crew in LifeWave hospital is very courteous and helpful.  I strongly suggest all the ladies who are suffering a condition like me and are concerned about getting operated should meet Dr. Datar once.",

I was surprised when Dr. Nikhil himself took me on wheelchair to operation theater.  The entire team works day night and always available on call.Not only  they are extremely well equipped in terms of knowledge in their field, they added the extra touch of care and concern throughout all our interactions. Even the helath insurance team Ms. Gauri has put her efforts to get our hospital expenses cashless. I would highly recommend anyone looking to undergo any such procedure, to consult with the highly efficient and competent team headed by the most amazingly knowledgeable and compassionate Dr Nikhil Datar.",

It was such a humane conversation, which you don\u2019t see with doctors these days. Luckily I got pregnant a year after and everything went well. My labour was long and painful and I remember towards the end when I was exhausted and in a lot of pain, he encouraged me in a way almost like a dad would and that\u2019s what took me through! I would highly recommend him over any other Gynac. The concept that a female can be comfortable only with a female Gynac is proven completely wrong by him because he\u2019s the best!",

First my husband was a bit skeptical of male Dr.  but just after our first visit we knew that he the only one we want our baby to be delivered. He so easily explained the entire thing and cleared all our doubts and above that his easy going nature was what relieved all of our tension. He recommended multiple exercises, diet etc for natural delivery and encouraged it. We ultimately had natural delivery after 25 hours of labour and there were 2 stages where Dr. could have easily went for c-section but he did not and put all his efforts. For that we would like to extend our gratitude to the entire team of Dr. Nikhil - Vishakha, Shiny, Suvarna, Shradha, Dig and Pradnya. Cheers!!\n",

Dr. Nikhil listened to us from a place of nothing and created actions which ultimately led us to delivering our baby boy naturally. The creation is all the more impressive now when I look back, considering my wife was overweight throughout the pregnancy. For a week prior to the due date, we panicked as we expected the delivery to have happened by then. Dr. Datar's guidance during this period was crucial and we were on course for a natural delivery.\nI clearly remember his smile when he entered the operation theater and a simple sentence in the way it was said, had my wife delivering our boy in less than 20 minutes since his arrival. Thank you Dr. Datar and Dr. Vishakha for making our journey a pleasant experience.         ",

He walked into the hospital the moment he had finished his rituals. He changed and walked into the operation theatre and asked us if we were stressed. By the time we could come up with cogent answers, the baby was delivered. \nAll we have to say Doctor Datar, you're quite a rock star. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. ",

But all thanks to Dr Nikhil Datar.. great great doctor, he kind of helped me through and tried everything to help me during that labour time which was like for more than 21 hours.

I think I felt about 50% ok as soon as I looked at that smiling, positive and energetic man! The best thing about him is he focuses more on the solution of a problem rather than discussing the problem itself which gives the patient an instant relief.\nTables for me were turned since then, now I am in my 37th week of pregnancy and in spite of facing all the negative symptoms that pregnancy gets along with it throughout I feel a positive hope that I will be having the best delivery as I believe I am in the safe hands. Dr Nikhil Datar for me is an angel a guiding star a lucky charm name it whatever you can. The world must know you are a super doctor and an amazing soul!! \nThanks for being the way you are simply amazing :)  ",

Also, he was very efficient in the OT and I did not for a minute feel like I was going to undergo a major surgery. His manner was very pleasant and put our minds at peace, knowing that we were in the hands of such an experienced doctor. Every staff in the hospital was very courteous and ensured that we had a good stay. I would recommend the hospital and Dr Datar to all to-be mothers.",

But Dr. Datar gave me a lot of hope and confidence about my situation by giving me a detailed explanation of the same and more possible treatment options to control the adenomyosis. Finally after giving a lot of thought, I decided to opt for hysterectomy. I am very happy about my decision and was very comfortable during the procedure and my recovery period which was absolutely painfree.  I have deep sense of gratitude for Dr. Datar for helping me out in my painful and chronic condition which had impacted my day to day life. Thank you doctor for a new life.",

Getting treated by u was just as getting treated by a friend. Everything explained appropriately without any misleading info or extra info..  Point to point conversation in a friendly way is 1 of ur best quality I had seen after changing 3 drs. Thanks for Being u and dealing with Patient like me who is even scared of injections.

There are changes that are physical and mental and if there is stress related to pregnancy it can cost you your baby. I was stuck in a similar situation where due to my age (in early 40s) there was fear of baby developing Down syndrome and I was suggested by the gynaecologist I was referring to then, to go for Amniocentesis test which is an invasive test and which can harm the baby if not done in the right way. When I came to Dr. Nikhil Datar first of all he studied my report and comforted me saying there are very less chances of test coming positive. He also asked me to go for NIPT test instead of Amniocentesis test as it is non invasive and not cause any harm to the baby. The report was normal. Dr\u2019s right approach and jolly nature helped me get rid of the stress and enjoy my pregnancy.\nLater in my pregnancy due to age I also developed gestational diabetes and blood pressure which Dr helped me handle very sensibly with his positive and lively attitude and required guidance. With Dr Nikhil Datar I felt I was in safe hands and I delivered normal and healthy baby. So if you are in safe hands and take good care of yourself even pregnancy in 40s can be a memorable and enjoyable experience.\n\nThank you so much Dr.",

It was his confidence that made me so comfortable from the start that I never thought I was meeting my Doctor. He always gave positivity and stood by Me and my husband. Sir conducted my laparoscopy last year, his treatment mame so relaxed that eventually I started trusting Sir more and more everytime.\nThroughout my pregnancy, he knew its not easy pregnancy but he never mentioned it, rather he always asked to be positive and answered all my questions.\nHe is a gem for all patients, I am really fortunate that I went into the right hands of Dr Nikhil. His prediction towards my pregnancy was so perfect right from the start till end, and eventually it did happen that way. \nThank you would be a small word for him. But nevertheless Thank you so much sir for all your efforts and contribution. It means a lot for us!\nI would also like to thank his team too Dr khyati, Hemangi, Staff of Lifewave and Yashada hospital. Truly helpful.",

Making us aware of each phase, symptoms n not to panic. He always explains each report n what it means. He also takes interest to understand how n what u r feeling n then explains why is it like that. He helped even to break hoax about so many maternity related things that v usually keep hearing from our elders n friends. It was really helpful to make our pregnancy period smooth n easy.\n2. His expertise n precision over the subject with all his work experience is awesome. Every time he told or guided us to take care about something or to take some decision while delivery, he was well before time and very accurate in his judgements n decisions.\nWe can strongly recommend him to our friends & family ** *** ** **** ****** ** ******* Thank u Dr. Nikhil for all your support and care!!",

Previously I was treated with surgery for this  4 times and further treatment was ruled out. I was very much depressed and lost all hopes . At that crucial time luckily I came to know about Dr Nikhil Datar.\nWhen I consulted Dr Nikhil, immediately he assured me that he will take care and I need not panic. That was the first ray of hope I got.  Endometriosis and Adenomyosis is a very peculiar and dangerous problem because of which patients suffer from acute pain and severe depression. The only solution to this was surgery, which was very risky at that juncture. But Dr Nikhil took the risk of surgery to save my life and he succeeded to give me a second birth. \nI take this opportunity to thank Dr Nikhil Datar profusely for all the support *** **** ********* ********* *  Definitely I can say, I am alive today because of Dr Nikhil's efforts.\nThanks a lot Sir.

Here we meet you and are told about my ovarian cyst condition post examination. \n\u00a0\nFor us, hearing about having an open surgery for cyst, was not an easy thing. Post 1st surgery, I was completely devasted and had left the hope of becoming mother ever. \u00a0\nThen comes my 6 months medication and again I am detected with another cyst which was treated via laparoscopy \u2013 2nd surgery. I still remember your words holding my hands \u2013 \u201cTu conceive karegi mujhe poora confidence hai\u201d . 5 different OT procedures and countless medical management, looks a mammoth ride which has now come to an end\n\u00a0\nYour always smiling face and optimistic attitude has been the invisible power for us to sail through this unknowing 2 years journey which had many unplanned routes. Despite extreme complicated case history, your continued effort and support has resulted today in twins which at some point was out of my dream. \n\u00a0\nFrom bottom from our heart \u2013 Thank You Dr Nikhil. Thank you for being always there for us to believe in our dream and for us not letting loose grip on this",

Most importantly he clears all the myths and the doubts regarding pregnancy and makes parents understand that pregnancy and childbirth\u00a0is a natural process. ** **** ****** * ***** *** ******* **************************************************************** *** *************** ******** ******************************************* ********* ******** Overall I think if any parent wants to go through an enjoyable, modern and comforting experience, Dr. Nikhil Datar is the perfect doctor to consult with.

We were new to locality soo was not sure about the gynac first, we just visited him to confirm the pregnancy after home test. But after talking to him we were just so sure and positive that he will be our gynac thereon as the spark and positive energy he has in him is just unmatchable. Everytime I went in his cabin with stress and questions but his way of explaning things made it all so simple and stress free. \n\nThe day when my water bursted early morning he was on leave (which was well informed) but still he came to check me up early morning and was continuously checking things on phone. The supporting gynac dr. Bhagyashree was a great help in his absence and did not make me feel left out or stressed as my gynac wasn't available. But later during my delivery Dr. Nikhil came in and explained the entire situation without giving any panic situation. My baby was later delivered and had a healthy happy baby. I would like to thank Dr. Datar for making my pregnancy experience so stress free and enjoyable.\n\nWould surely recommend him ** ** ** *** **** **************",

Who have such problems, can first contact with the Dr. and will easily get understand the things. If I say, I prefer male Dr.,or you can say I found myself more comfortable with the perticular ( Dr. Nikhil). \nAnyways, my journey started with Dr. in my 3rd month of pregnancy, when I switched my Dr. From___ to Dr. Nikhil Datar. I found him very very generous, very genuine and the most about him, his enthusiasm. You can say his experience to deal with different people makes him understand what you actually want from him which I thought his ' Smartness'.  Overall I can say he is my favourite  and the positive vibes comes from every appointment give you strength to push yourself ahead in your journey. The most I like is he always suggest you a positive side of problem. Whenever I asked about my lil lil exciting queries, he always responds in such a way, you get satisfied. The most imp. he never drive your thoughts in his own way, what I feel nowdays, docs do. And this is true in his conversation when I ask about 'to do' things for normal dilivery. He always says why not. As such, I have lot to write here, but let me complete my journey, and I ll be back soon. \n\nTill now I can only say, the Dr. is amazing. One can blindly follow him. I am associated with cloudnine only bcoz of him.\n ",

He has always been reassuring , attentive to all my doubts and problems as well as one of the most energetic person i have known. Around him it would never be a dull moment nor would i think about the surgery. It is today because of him that I again all fit and fine but most importantly fearless.Thank you doctor for constantly motivating me and for ur kind and thoughtful concern in regard to my health and providing me with excellent medical care.

He is very kind and gem of a person. I always walked in tensed and scared with so many questions in my mind but he made me comfortable and answered all my queries with a smile maybe its his experience that he knew what questions I would ask.\nI still remember I was very nervous and scared in the operation theatre but he calmed me down and was very supportive, my delivery experience was very nice. I believe words are not enough to express. I would like to thank Dr Nikhil Datar for making my first delivery experience so wonderful.",

Every meeting with you throughout the 9 months was fantastic and helped me to feel assured about the process.\n\nDelivering my baby was much easier than I anticipated. Thank you for coming to the hospital during the middle of the night to deliver Aadvik. I was very glad to have you there since you\u2019ve been caring for me since the inception of pregnancy. Your easy going manner helped me to relax. I am glad everything went so well! The post operative care and recovery was also very good.\n\nDr. Datar is the best gynec one could ever get.

He is very practical in his approach. Doesnt recommend unnecessary medicines. Remembers your entire case history because of which you dont have either repeat yourself or remind him of anything. Lastly i can proudly say that when you are consulting Dr. Datar, be rest assured that you and your baby are in the best hands. I am glad that my friend recommended cloudnine hospital and Dr. Nikhil Datar to me.",
