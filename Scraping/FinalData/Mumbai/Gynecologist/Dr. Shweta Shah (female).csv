"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"We met Dr. Shweta Shah before I conceived. My Husband & I took an instant liking towards her because of the way she guided us.

To start with, she didn‚Äôt judge us for planning a baby at an age of 35, instead she showed us a proper path to plan & have a healthy conception & pregnancy journey. 

She is highly professional yet very compassionate towards her patients. She has always been available for us and our queries at all times throughout the 9 months & even till date. No matter how many times we wanted clarity or understanding of anything, she very patiently explained us whatever we wanted to know or understand.

I told her at our first meeting that I would like to deliver normally & she supported my decision & motivated me to work towards having a normal delivery. Even at the time of delivery, had it not been for her sheer perseverance & motivation & the extremely helpful staff at Cloudnine Malad, I would not have been able to deliver normally.

We are forever grateful to her for delivering our baby!!!
