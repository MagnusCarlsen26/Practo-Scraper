                "review_text": "I went to Dr. Narvekar for the first time on 19-March-2018 for extreme and severe pain during menstruation. I went to a lot of doctors before that but most of them were only interested in knowing if I wanted to conceive or no and were least interested in solving the issue at hand. Dr. Narvekar is one helluva polished doctor. He just asked me his usual questions regarding my menstrual health, my age, and asked me if I've had kids which is the general question that most doctors ask. I was 36 then and married for 12 years already. Doctor told me that the later I push my conception, the more complications I  will be inviting for my child and myself. That is it. Thereafter he started all my tests and we learnt simultaneously that along with a blocked fallopian tube and a T-shape Uterus, I also had endometriosis. With one corrective surgery to cure all three issues I was finally free from my pain and the potholed road to conception was now a cemented multi lane highway. Almost exactly a year later on 15-March-2019 I was blessed with a baby boy via normal conception and normal delivery by Dr. Narvekar. My entire pregnancy was very tough. I was in constant pain, had a cervical stitch, severe pelvic pain, extreme morning sickness was on complete bed rest. Through all this Dr. Narvekar assured me and patiently guided me at every stage of my pregnancy. Even though you can't reach doctor directly, he is still 100% accessible via his clinic that I would call at several times, sometimes late at night or early mornings. They would speak to the doctor and call me back asap advising me what to do. Doctor helped me pull through my entire 9 months and gave me a normal delivery. Dr. Narvekar's hands are blessed. He is always impeccably dressed in formals and is very calm and patient with you. He will only answer what you need to know he won't frighten you with what ifs. If you're looking for a doctor who is extremely skilled, loaded with experience, calm yet firm and blessed with golden hands then I highly recommend Dr. Narvekar for your gynaec health, reproductive issues and normal and high risk obstetrics. Just one advice, make sure while pregnant you don't put on too much weight.",
