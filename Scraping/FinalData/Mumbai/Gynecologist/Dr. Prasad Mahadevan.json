We visited him starting second month and were with him till delivery. \nCheck ups: During visits always wait times are less than an hr (through he get many patients). He was always calm and answered all our queries. Great thing about him is he tells you only what is needed. He will never add to your anxiety. We went by what he said. I remember his typical dialogue after check up -- \" All well.. Lets do another check up after one month\". Tests suggested were optimum. Please understand he is not there to answer your google queries.\nDelivery: My wife delivered at his clinic. It is run in a traditional way but really pleased with the level of care. Extremely clean. You can only get your bag -- they provide everything (though we took baby clothes/ towels n all). Another amazing thing -- he charges nearly the same for normal and c-section so i was assured that he won' t do anything for want of additional fees. In our case he waited for 15 hrs.. then took decisive step and performed normal delivery using vacuum pump/ forceps.. Always grateful to him.. Recommend to all Mom and Dad to be's. ",

We visited him starting second month and were with him till delivery. \nCheck ups: During visits always wait times are less than an hr (through he get many patients). He was always calm and answered all our queries. Great thing about him is he tells you only what is needed. He will never add to your anxiety. We went by what he said. I remember his typical dialogue after check up -- \" All well.. Lets do another check up after one month\". Tests suggested were optimum. Please understand he is not there to answer your google queries.\nDelivery: My wife delivered at his clinic. It is run in a traditional way but really pleased with the level of care. Extremely clean. You can only get your bag -- they provide everything (though we took baby clothes/ towels n all). Another amazing thing -- he charges nearly the same for normal and c-section so i was assured that he won' t do anything for want of additional fees. In our case he waited for 15 hrs.. then took decisive step and performed normal delivery using vacuum pump/ forceps.. Always grateful to him.. Recommend to all Mom and Dad to be's. ",
