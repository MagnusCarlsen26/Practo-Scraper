"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Infertility Evaluation / Treatment,",0,0,YES,"This is the review I am writing after our one-year journey with Dr. Shruti ma'am.

We were planning our second child, and during that time, my wife had two spontaneous miscarriages with pregnancies of less than two months. After the last miscarriage, it was almost 1.5 years; she could not even conceive. We were getting impatient. In between, we changed our gynecologist and moved to a second one who suggested she has PCOS. After a few months of PCOS treatment and seeing no improvement, we thought of taking a second opinion.

I had seen the board of Shruti ma'am clinic on link road earlier but was hesitant then. As it was COVID time,  we consulted online Shruti ma'am on our first call. During that call, she ruled out PCOS. She logically explained that the AMH level of my wife is small, so it can't be PCOS. It was a big realization for us that we were on the wrong track, and we immediately switched to ma'am.

During this one-year journey, we have seen her closely putting tremendous efforts for us to see the result. She will constantly carry out some improvements in medicines and herself will do the follicular scan. Instead of just believing in ultrasound reports, she will present there to see if everything is fine. She will follow the path methodically and logically.

She is a confident and amazing doctor. She is available round the clock for you to handle any emergency or query. She will make the patient feel at ease and will provide moral support. Her presence gives very positive vibes and makes you believe you will see your baby one day. In the beginning, I was skeptical seeing all the 5 star reviews, but I now realize the reason for them.

Due to her efforts, my wife has now conceived and is now in 3rd month. We have got some wisdom during this time. For those struggling to conceive for more than a year, better see a fertility specialist as a regular gynecologist won't be of much help. If you are with Shruti ma'am, just follow her guidance regarding medicines, injections, tests, etc., and trust her instincts. Believe me; you will reach your goal timely with that.

Just as ma'am is wonderful, her staff at the clinic also deserves the same praise. They are cooperative and ready to help you out with small small things.

Lastly, ma'am, thank you is a very small word to say for what you have given us. Throughout our life, we will be grateful to you for the joy you have brought in our life.",2022-09-21 17:35:51,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
