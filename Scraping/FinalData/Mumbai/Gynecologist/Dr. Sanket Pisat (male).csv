,,0,0,YES,"** ****** ***** ** ** ********* *********** *******. I had a very good experience of fibroid removal surgery which was almost painless. Many other doctors had suggested for open surgery but Dr Sanket was confident of removing by  lapro method. He explained us entire procedure and all possible options so we were totally at ease before the surgery!
Also gave us a wide choice of hospitals... being on a narrow budget we could choose a low cost alternative, but it was still done fully cashless. Thanks Dr Pisat God Bless!",2021-11-16 05:28:32,False,True,Pravin,,,
"Doctor friendliness,","Laparoscopy Hysterectomy,",0,0,YES,"Visited for Hysteroscopic Myoma resection + Laparoscopic Myomectomy

Dr. Sanket Pisat is a excellent doctor and he properly and frankly explain the problem and clarify all the doubts moreover, the doctor answered all my question with calm and composure and the hospital entire staff is good and extra caring during my entire treatment. It just wasn’t the treatment, but the doctor's reassuring words which gave me the strength to pull through my condition.

However, personally I had a great experience and extremely comforting with your hygienic hospital.

 I am grateful I got the confidence that I am in safe hands.

Thank you for the wonderful treatment and care taken by  Dr. Sanket Pisat and his whole team.

,,0,0,YES,"We had a pleasant experience during our surgery with Dr Sanket Pisat. Because it was a complicated cancer surgery he made sure the cancer Surgeon, pathologist doctor, emergency ICU doctor etc were all informed and ready before starting surgery itself. In spite of having his junior assistants, he himself visited twice daily to make sure my mom was comfortable. Would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for reliable opinion and skilled care",2021-11-15 13:32:35,False,True,Vijay Chauhan,,,
