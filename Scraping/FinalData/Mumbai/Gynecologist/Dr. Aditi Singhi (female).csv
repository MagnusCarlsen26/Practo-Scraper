,,0,0,YES,She is a wonderful doctor and a great human being. I visited her for miscarriage and thereafter a successful pregnancy. She has been my doctor throughout my 4+ years of ttc and fertility journey and finally helped me deliver my beautiful baby boy. My delivery and post partum recovery was very very smooth inspite of csection due to baby being breech and several other complications. She is my most preferred gynaec in town! Thanks a lot to Maam!!,2024-02-28 10:19:12,False,True,Sneha Roy Choudhary,,,

,,0,0,YES,One of my most memorable interactions with Dr. Aditi Singhi. I was blessed with a baby girl through normal delivery under her supervision. She was able to relate to every aspect of my  9 month journey. I would strongly recommend her because of her expertise and sincerity in her field. I wish her the best of luck in her career.,2021-04-10 15:54:57,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
