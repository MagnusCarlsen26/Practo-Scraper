He works step by step and does not push to put one’s body through extreme measures straightaway.

He went out of his way and organised an HSG for me under anaesthesia, for which I’m very grateful.

Nurse Vrinda was a very motherly figure around the clinic, she was so caring and helpful, whether it's with pre/ post-op care or just talking to you and making you feel better.
Dr.Dilip was my anesthesiologist and he made sure I kept talking and distracting myself till I was put under.
I will be recommending Dr.Ankesh to any one who needs it as I have never had a better experience with any doctor , as he really cares about his patients and will actually empathize with them as well, which makes him a very personable doctor.

He takes his time to explain you theory in the most simplest manner and not once did i felt that i was being rushed into the diagnosis. I have been to 3 other gynecologist in the last 3 years and I was always felt that my PCOD is my fault and it was a huge mountain to climb. But Dr Ankesh kept assuring me that this is all treatable and instill confidence in me that he is with me during this process. For the first time I felt like we both were on the same side. His knowledge, expertise, warmth and process for treatment is why you should visit him. I highly recommend him to everyone. Trust me once you meet him, you know that your problem is going to be treated and not just shoved aside. He has always been available to answer my slightest to silliest queries.

He does not just treat the problem, but heals the situation. As I bled beyond the menopausal deadline, Doctor did an internal examination to discover my endometrial lining was thicker than the healthy marker. He suggested a D&C and hysterectoscopy to rule out abnormalities. The biopsy report came and Doctor called me in to explain my options - wait and watch or get a preventative laparoscopic hysterectomy done.

He explained to me the pros and cons of both the options. My husband and I decided to take the “prevention is better than cure” course.

Dr Ankesh called us in for a Counselling session to explain the entire procedure and answer every one of our questions. We felt safe and secure going through the procedure with him.

From pre-operative to post-operative care, Dr Ankesh & his entire team have scaled heights of caring and healing, including his Anaesthetologist who kept a check on my blood glucose levels till discharge.

I feel blessed to be treated by the best. 

Despite my kind of nervous disposition caused by 31 years of type 1 diabetes, I actually felt relaxed and confident that I will emerge healed from this procedure.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Gynae advice,",0,0,YES,"During this terrible lockdown, my constant fear was and had been that my loved ones should not fall ill or have to visit a doctor, clinic or a hospital. Ironically, the chosen one happened to be myself. All of a sudden late evening, I started having severe cramps in my pelvic region with severe pain radiating to my back. The first thing which came to my mind was either it is an ovarian cyst or a kidney stone as I happened to be diagnosed with them sometime back but was in clear till now. Tried connecting with all the doctors known to me but somehow did not get the revert and did not know how to go about as the agony was unbearable. Tried self-medicating as had previously too had incidents similar to these but it just seemed to worsen. And, then, I recollected my best friends doctor and thought of contacting him. He was like a Messiah, a saviour. A prompt reply, prescription and also papers so that we could go for diagnosis and not only that he ensured that he spoke to the sonologist. After confirmation, that an ovarian cyst had burst, he asked us to come to the clinic so that he could explain the line of treatment.
I, really appreciate that at the time when everyone's safety is at stake, he was true to his profession, met us, guided and explained and was ever so courteous to even ask us to inform him the very next day about my well-being.

I visited Dr. Ankesh following referrals from my mother and my sister and his Instagram sessions for discomfort during periods and associated problems. This was my first visit to a gynaecologist ever. I was noticeably apprehensive and shy about the visit. Catching on to this fear, Dr. Ankesh made me comfortable with the entire consultation. He took a thorough interest in learning about my lifestyle and habits and more importantly what made that consultation necessary for me. Throughout the consultation, our interaction was without fear of judgment which, in my opinion, is very important. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism a year back. When informed about the diagnosis, Dr. Ankesh asked questions related to the symptoms that led to the diagnosis, the medical reports and the treatment thereafter which left no stone unturned in terms of knowing previous medical history. At the end of this briefing, Dr. Ankesh frankly and openly said that he was unwilling to order tests and medicines that are unwarranted which was much to my surprise because I was expecting a long list of blood tests and examinations. 

Two major practises of Dr. Ankesh that makes me want to follow his advice to the letter are: (1) Dr. Ankesh explains the cause/problem without using any heavy medical jargon or words that may cause some anxiety or stress. He uses plastic organ models and drawings in his explanation and how the course of action recommended by him would address the problem. (2) The lifestyle modifications recommended by him are doable and gradual and does not give an impression of a ‘do or die’ situation. 

Dr. Ankesh does not hurry through a consultation. He is calm, patient and definitely not a doctor who is just trying to empty his waiting room 😊

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","PCOD/PCOS Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr Ankesh Sahetya lives up to what one would have gathered from his Instagram page. I have done one consultation visit and one follow up with him so far. 

A little about me: I am 29 years old, married. My presenting concerns were irregular periods, multiple small follicles in the ovaries, acne, some weight gain on and off, hairfall, stress, elevated Insulin and Blood Sugar levels and extremely high Prolactin despite not being pregnant. 

Here's why my experience with him was a positive one and why I'd highly recommend him to any of my friends: 

1. He built a good rapport with me and made me feel comfortable. 
2. I was given all the information that I needed, to my satisfaction. All my follow up questions were answered patiently and in a way that I would understand better. He performed an ultrasound for me in his clinic itself which gave us the most recent and new information about my uterus- we discovered a few cysts on both ovaries. He also calmly went through a checklist related to PCOS for me and also explained specifically what the severity of my case looks like. I learned that it wasn't as severe as I was assuming. 
3. His prescription was spot on- he prescribed a medicine for reducing the cyst and a supplement for regulating Insulin processing. In just 16-17 days, my Insulin and blood sugar levels reduced (this was also along with an meal plan I was following from a different nutrition expert), I got my period and was able to get further hormone tests done. 
4. The follow up has been good- he checked on all the things he had prescribed earlier to me and also told me what the test results meant and prescribed a medication as needed. 
5. I did not think that I was made to do unnecessary procedures or take unnecessary medication. I worry a lot and therefore I look these things up a lot and I have been satisfied with his process. 
6. His availability- I was given an appointment both times as per my convenience, and he is also easily approachable and responsive on WhatsApp. 
7. The facilities are quite decent and the nurses and he also made me feel physically comfortable in all the procedures that they carried out. 

I am very glad my Husband found him when he was looking up good Doctors for PCOS and his search results suggested that Dr Ankesh Sahetya is the best person to go to. I am very happy with my experience and would want to continue consulting him in the future. I wish him the best of health and success in his endeavors!

The process overall was smooth, quick, transparent and pain free. We were made very comfortable by the hospital staff.

We would also like to add, that in a society like ours Dr. Ankesh and his staff’s approach was free of judgement ehich put my husband and I at ease.
