As a foreign citizen from the very beginning of my pregnancy I was stuck in India because of the pandemic, she guided me perfectly throughout such a complex period and under difficult circumstances. She is the most meticulous doctor I have ever met. She pays attention to every tiny detail, she follows up the patients very closely and she works out a solution to any problem no matter what it is. She is very communicative and even compassionate; she explains everything to the patients and she informs the patients about all the options and processes. Occasionally, waiting time can be too long for a regular visit but it is definitely worth it because she gives the time they require to all the patients. A medical problem related to pregnancy is a very sensitive subject. As a foreigner and as a Phd I was very doubtful and picky yet I felt very comfortable after I met her. I have complete trust in her expertise and experience. I completely rely upon her advice and I feel very luck to have her as my doctor.",
