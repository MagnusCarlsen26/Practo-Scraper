She always listens to the problem clearly and patiently, and then prescribe medicine if actually needed. We were planning  a baby from last 1.5 years and before we came to know about her clinic thru practo we had consulted many gynac however that has not bring us the results which we wishes for. My period was not clear and also have high thyroid .  When we went to her clinic,  after few test, endrometric polyp was diagnosed and my two fallopian tube also found blocked. So doctor decided to go for a surgery to remove endrometric polyp through hysteroscopy and also tubes clearing thru laparoscopy surgery.  Under her continual gudience and medication my thyroid also in normal range and period also improved. Most important thing , after these two surgeries ,I conceived naturally within 3 months. Till now my pregnancy journey is smooth. I'm very happy and so thankful to Dr. Vaishali mam. I would surely recommend this doctor to you all as your gynecologist including those who are planning to become parents..",

My period was not clear and also have high thyroid .  When we went to her clinic,  after few test, endrometric polyp was diagnosed and my two fallopian tube also found blocked. So doctor decided to go for a surgery to remove endrometric polyp through hysteroscopy and also tubes clearing thru laparoscopy surgery.  Under her continual gudience and medication my thyroid also in normal range and period also improved. Most important thing , after these two surgeries ,I conceived naturally within 3 months. Till now my pregnancy journey is smooth. I'm very happy and so thankful to Dr. Vaishali mam. I would surely recommend this doctor to you all as your gynecologist including those who are planning to become parents..",
