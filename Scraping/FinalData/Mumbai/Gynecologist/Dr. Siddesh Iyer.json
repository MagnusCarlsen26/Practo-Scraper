We can't put it into words rather I would say as doctor Siddesh has been a companion and a strong pillar of support, he has guided us, he has explained every minor detail. Whatever questions we asked, might have been silly too but he answered them patiently with a smile the smile on doctor Siddhesh's face is magnetic and I would say we are encouraged to ask questions and have them answered. So it was a very beautiful experience we never felt that we are going to a hospital or to Meet a doctor it was like a friend was waiting for us on the other side and what do I say about Mrs. Doc ? Mrs. Doc is a pillar of support And a big thanks to the staff too. The staff is also very cooperative. Atmosphere at the clinicI puts you at your ease as soon as you enter . To meet the Doctors and talk to them was a stress reliever, it gives you relief even for from your minor ills, and you know minor things which disturb during pregnancy and delivery . It was a joyful journey that's all we can say thanks  to both the doctors to Doc and Mrs. Doc  thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nEven when something  puts you down or you feel a little down and things are a little greyish, I would say one talk with the doctor and it puts you back on track you feel OK . He is there for us . I would say from beginning to end of my journey They are there for you. Both of the docs thanks\ud83c\udf39",
