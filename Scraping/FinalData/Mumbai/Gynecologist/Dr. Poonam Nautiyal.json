The event was extremely traumatic for both of us. So the second time, we were quite concerned about getting a good obstetrician, especially who can manage the deep set fear and trauma of my wife, and help us conclude the pregnancy successfully. \n\nWe searched in Practo, and found Dr Poonam, amongst a few others. But we liked her profile since there were many good reviews about her. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 9 months since we have been interacting with Dr Poonam. During the course of time, she managed to create an environment of safety and trust for my wife, through consultations to the extent that my wife got deeply attached to her emotionally. In this time interval of 9 months there have been times where Dr Poonam was unavailable for physical consultation for a couple of weeks. But she provided us with a backup doctor to handle any emergencies. Even while she was travelling, Dr Poonam was still always available for telephonic consultations. Hats off to her dedication. Her concern for my wife seemed similar to her own daughter. \n\nWe are now the happy parents of a newborn baby. The baby was born in Surya Hospitals via Cesarean (because of the previous mishap we didn\u2019t want to take chances). Prior to the surgery, Dr Poonam had let us talk to one of her patients who had just delivered via Cesarean to check how easy or difficult it is to recover after a Cesarean, and associated first hand experiences.\n\nDr Poonam helped us with the hospitalisation. She also explained to us that we might need an attendant for the mother and baby post operation and gave us references for attendants. She was extremely supportive for all our requests. She got her own team to perform the operation. It was done at the exact time of our choice, the surgery went perfectly well. She even invited me to be there physically in the operating theatre so that I could provide emotional support to my wife during the surgery. I have found Dr Poonam extremely thoughtful and sensitive in these matters - she comprehends these innate needs of a to-be-parent couple so easily. Her emotional intelligence must be extremely high. \n\nThe operation has gone very well. My wife recovered extremely fast from the operation and was mobile within a couple of days (we thought it would be weeks). \n\nIn a world where there are so many reckless doctors (like the one we had the misfortune to consult for our first baby), it is doctors like Dr Poonam who bring back our faith for the medical profession. \n\nI am humbly thankful, grateful, and fortunate, as a husband and a parent, to have been blessed with an angel like Dr Poonam. \n\nFor any expectant mother / father, I will highly recommend Dr Poonam - you will be in very safe hands, and I am talking from the perspective of a first hand wonderful experience.",

The best part about her is that she personally gets involved in her cases. She explains things in a very simplified way and gives sufficient time for the patients to ask questions. We asked her a lot of questions during my pregnancy journey and she was very prompt in answering all of them, be it during clinic visit or over call/whatsapp. There were lot of ups and downs during my pregnancy journey but Dr Poonam was there for me both as a doctor and a great emotional support. She was reachable 24x7 and always made me feel I was in safe hands.\n\nI had to undergo C-section due to some underlying conditions but everything went very smooth. I was nervous and tensed when I was admitted and being prepared for the procedure but Dr Poonam personally came into my room, met my family and I felt so calm and relaxed. She guided me very well for post delivery care and breastfeeding. She had promised me a healthy baby and fulfilled the same. By the end of my pregnancy journey it feels like she is family and she is still approachable for any queries we have. For us she is a god figure and approaching her for my pregnancy journey was the best decision we made.",

We found her via practo app and basis the feedbacks wanted to give it a shot to find a suitable doctor for us.\n\nBefore going to her I had been visiting another doctor for initial two months of my pregnancy and I must tell you that all our visits lasted for not more than five minutes and all she use to say was \"sab Khao, travel ka Dhyan rakho\". I was never told the initial struggles of pregnancy nor any medicine to take care of my weakness and vomiting. With such insensitivity I was on a mission to find a new doctor. Being new to Mumbai all I could rely on was the online feedbacks. After going through feedback for Dr Poonam Nautiyal on Practo we decided to meet her. Our first meeting had been awesome!! She counselled us for 30-40 minutes , explaining Do's and Don't, setting up the right expectations, explaining how body changes during pregnancy, etc. The best was when she shared her number and asked me to call her up anytime for any doubt rather than googling or consulting friends/ family. Please note, this is something which doctors usually never do!! After this visit we were clear that we are going to stick to her and an unsaid trust developed for her.\n\nThe visits had been really knowledgeable and for everything she guided us on, she gave us the explanation about it which gave us an assurance that we were in safe hands. Also, there was a bonus, which was that she not only counselled me but my hubby as well regarding my health and mood swings :D\n\nDuring 36 week during sonography we found that the baby had turned into breech position which was kind of uncomfortable and something which made me feel very low. After receiving the call from the sonography centre, she immediately called me to comfort me and on our visit, the next day she mentally prepared me for c section in case baby doesnt turn back, comforted me and suggested that we wait for another two weeks, hoping the baby turns again! Post 38 week, we decided for a planned c section since the baby was still in breech. The surgery was very very very smooth and painless. During our stay in hospital, she visited us often, called us in evening to enquire about my health, taught me breastfeeding, took me for my first walk post c section and guided me on my new journey called motherhood. Also, post delivery we were guided us to get the baby checked since she was making some grunting noise. At this moment, she had been more than a family to us and went with my hubby to child speciality hospital to get the her checked up as quickly as possible (Pls note, this is something we don't expect from a doctor but she did) \n\nI am glad I am putting this feedback for her. ***** ** *** ** *** **** ****** * ***** **** ***** I have been truly blessed. Without doubt I would recommend her for your all gynaecology needs. \n\nTotally reliable, genuine doctor who makes your pregnancy journey very smooth and assuring everything will be taken care off thereby easing you of any stress or tension.\n\nThanks you sooooo much doctor!!!\n",

After getting pregnant I ws so happy and ws thinking of giving the best for self and my baby. So I started wt my consultation in hiranandani. One of the top hospital. Lot of spending.. blood test, sonography, n many other test. My first pregnancy so ws not sure if I ws doing right. But smwhr my mind ws not satisfied n ws a bit nervous..thinking all OK. . One of top category dr I ws consulting but all visit I got to meet Jr dr asking me do test n even the main dr insisted do several test to confirm gud health of child. As we know dr at hira want to complete their target. They forgot to tell me my placenta ws low lying and I need to rest. Unaware of this I continued my daily scheduled and in my 6th month my placenta ws completely down n I started bleeding. It ws a nightmare. Approached hiranandani and they admitted  and I HD a HORRIBLE experience.  When asked dr she started shouting n suggested abortion. I didn't know wht to do.my husband and mom took discharge against medical advice. Frnd referred me to dr poonam. I ws completely bed ridden. I called dr n just talking to her on ph I ws a bit relaxed and positive. My problem ws bleeding. If I move I use to bleed. I ws at 28 week  and I had to go 35 weeks. Smhw I went for consultation and I can't explain the support dr gave me. She is a saviour. As days passed my condition ws more critical. There is no med which cn bring my placenta up. I ws afraid to stay at home. 1 and half month I ws admitted. Every day dr use to come n boost my moral explained things. I ws afraid of heavy med. Understand me she gv min med and explained me all reason of gvng those med. I used to trouble her every day but she kept her calm n supported me. I could continue my pregnancy only because of Dr Poonam.  She assured me all would be well. 35 th week n dr sd we can't wait and HD to do c section. I HD my schedule c section at 7 on 25th Oct.  But mrg 4 I started heavy bleed. I called dr n in 10 min she came n arranged all n at 5 I delivered my baby boy. All thanks to my sweet dr poonam. She is excellent.\n\nNw a days we run behind top notch dr but unfortunately they are behind money n don't care of spending time n explaining healthy pregnancy.. it's just reports and test. Dr poonam is amazing. She herself use to call me n explain all. If u really need a good care of ur baby and stay positive... it's only dr poonam. I really we'd like to thank from the bottom of my heart for giving me my lovely son. \n",

The event was extremely traumatic for both of us. So the second time, we were quite concerned about getting a good obstetrician, especially who can manage the deep set fear and trauma of my wife, and help us conclude the pregnancy successfully. \n\nWe searched in Practo, and found Dr Poonam, amongst a few others. But we liked her profile since there were many good reviews about her. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 9 months since we have been interacting with Dr Poonam. During the course of time, she managed to create an environment of safety and trust for my wife, through consultations to the extent that my wife got deeply attached to her emotionally. In this time interval of 9 months there have been times where Dr Poonam was unavailable for physical consultation for a couple of weeks. But she provided us with a backup doctor to handle any emergencies. Even while she was travelling, Dr Poonam was still always available for telephonic consultations. Hats off to her dedication. Her concern for my wife seemed similar to her own daughter. \n\nWe are now the happy parents of a newborn baby. The baby was born in Surya Hospitals via Cesarean (because of the previous mishap we didn\u2019t want to take chances). Prior to the surgery, Dr Poonam had let us talk to one of her patients who had just delivered via Cesarean to check how easy or difficult it is to recover after a Cesarean, and associated first hand experiences.\n\nDr Poonam helped us with the hospitalisation. She also explained to us that we might need an attendant for the mother and baby post operation and gave us references for attendants. She was extremely supportive for all our requests. She got her own team to perform the operation. It was done at the exact time of our choice, the surgery went perfectly well. She even invited me to be there physically in the operating theatre so that I could provide emotional support to my wife during the surgery. I have found Dr Poonam extremely thoughtful and sensitive in these matters - she comprehends these innate needs of a to-be-parent couple so easily. Her emotional intelligence must be extremely high. \n\nThe operation has gone very well. My wife recovered extremely fast from the operation and was mobile within a couple of days (we thought it would be weeks). \n\nIn a world where there are so many reckless doctors (like the one we had the misfortune to consult for our first baby), it is doctors like Dr Poonam who bring back our faith for the medical profession. \n\nI am humbly thankful, grateful, and fortunate, as a husband and a parent, to have been blessed with an angel like Dr Poonam. \n\nFor any expectant mother / father, I will highly recommend Dr Poonam - you will be in very safe hands, and I am talking from the perspective of a first hand wonderful experience.",

The best part about her is that she personally gets involved in her cases. She explains things in a very simplified way and gives sufficient time for the patients to ask questions. We asked her a lot of questions during my pregnancy journey and she was very prompt in answering all of them, be it during clinic visit or over call/whatsapp. There were lot of ups and downs during my pregnancy journey but Dr Poonam was there for me both as a doctor and a great emotional support. She was reachable 24x7 and always made me feel I was in safe hands.\n\nI had to undergo C-section due to some underlying conditions but everything went very smooth. I was nervous and tensed when I was admitted and being prepared for the procedure but Dr Poonam personally came into my room, met my family and I felt so calm and relaxed. She guided me very well for post delivery care and breastfeeding. She had promised me a healthy baby and fulfilled the same. By the end of my pregnancy journey it feels like she is family and she is still approachable for any queries we have. For us she is a god figure and approaching her for my pregnancy journey was the best decision we made.",

We found her via practo app and basis the feedbacks wanted to give it a shot to find a suitable doctor for us.\n\nBefore going to her I had been visiting another doctor for initial two months of my pregnancy and I must tell you that all our visits lasted for not more than five minutes and all she use to say was \"sab Khao, travel ka Dhyan rakho\". I was never told the initial struggles of pregnancy nor any medicine to take care of my weakness and vomiting. With such insensitivity I was on a mission to find a new doctor. Being new to Mumbai all I could rely on was the online feedbacks. After going through feedback for Dr Poonam Nautiyal on Practo we decided to meet her. Our first meeting had been awesome!! She counselled us for 30-40 minutes , explaining Do's and Don't, setting up the right expectations, explaining how body changes during pregnancy, etc. The best was when she shared her number and asked me to call her up anytime for any doubt rather than googling or consulting friends/ family. Please note, this is something which doctors usually never do!! After this visit we were clear that we are going to stick to her and an unsaid trust developed for her.\n\nThe visits had been really knowledgeable and for everything she guided us on, she gave us the explanation about it which gave us an assurance that we were in safe hands. Also, there was a bonus, which was that she not only counselled me but my hubby as well regarding my health and mood swings :D\n\nDuring 36 week during sonography we found that the baby had turned into breech position which was kind of uncomfortable and something which made me feel very low. After receiving the call from the sonography centre, she immediately called me to comfort me and on our visit, the next day she mentally prepared me for c section in case baby doesnt turn back, comforted me and suggested that we wait for another two weeks, hoping the baby turns again! Post 38 week, we decided for a planned c section since the baby was still in breech. The surgery was very very very smooth and painless. During our stay in hospital, she visited us often, called us in evening to enquire about my health, taught me breastfeeding, took me for my first walk post c section and guided me on my new journey called motherhood. Also, post delivery we were guided us to get the baby checked since she was making some grunting noise. At this moment, she had been more than a family to us and went with my hubby to child speciality hospital to get the her checked up as quickly as possible (Pls note, this is something we don't expect from a doctor but she did) \n\nI am glad I am putting this feedback for her. ***** ** *** ** *** **** ****** * ***** **** ***** I have been truly blessed. Without doubt I would recommend her for your all gynaecology needs. \n\nTotally reliable, genuine doctor who makes your pregnancy journey very smooth and assuring everything will be taken care off thereby easing you of any stress or tension.\n\nThanks you sooooo much doctor!!!\n",

After getting pregnant I ws so happy and ws thinking of giving the best for self and my baby. So I started wt my consultation in hiranandani. One of the top hospital. Lot of spending.. blood test, sonography, n many other test. My first pregnancy so ws not sure if I ws doing right. But smwhr my mind ws not satisfied n ws a bit nervous..thinking all OK. . One of top category dr I ws consulting but all visit I got to meet Jr dr asking me do test n even the main dr insisted do several test to confirm gud health of child. As we know dr at hira want to complete their target. They forgot to tell me my placenta ws low lying and I need to rest. Unaware of this I continued my daily scheduled and in my 6th month my placenta ws completely down n I started bleeding. It ws a nightmare. Approached hiranandani and they admitted  and I HD a HORRIBLE experience.  When asked dr she started shouting n suggested abortion. I didn't know wht to do.my husband and mom took discharge against medical advice. Frnd referred me to dr poonam. I ws completely bed ridden. I called dr n just talking to her on ph I ws a bit relaxed and positive. My problem ws bleeding. If I move I use to bleed. I ws at 28 week  and I had to go 35 weeks. Smhw I went for consultation and I can't explain the support dr gave me. She is a saviour. As days passed my condition ws more critical. There is no med which cn bring my placenta up. I ws afraid to stay at home. 1 and half month I ws admitted. Every day dr use to come n boost my moral explained things. I ws afraid of heavy med. Understand me she gv min med and explained me all reason of gvng those med. I used to trouble her every day but she kept her calm n supported me. I could continue my pregnancy only because of Dr Poonam.  She assured me all would be well. 35 th week n dr sd we can't wait and HD to do c section. I HD my schedule c section at 7 on 25th Oct.  But mrg 4 I started heavy bleed. I called dr n in 10 min she came n arranged all n at 5 I delivered my baby boy. All thanks to my sweet dr poonam. She is excellent.\n\nNw a days we run behind top notch dr but unfortunately they are behind money n don't care of spending time n explaining healthy pregnancy.. it's just reports and test. Dr poonam is amazing. She herself use to call me n explain all. If u really need a good care of ur baby and stay positive... it's only dr poonam. I really we'd like to thank from the bottom of my heart for giving me my lovely son. \n",

Patient aways feel comfortable with her throughout journey. She is very friendly and always means 24/7 available for you on call or what's app. 2. She always answers all queries. She prefers patient's convenience and comfort first. 3. She recommends other best doctors for other tests as and when required.4. She  not only has expertise but also always  genuine compassion and concerns towards patient's.Throught out 9 month pregancy journey went very smooth but due to high AFI index, I had to choose surgery at last moment with the advise of Dr. Poonam. With her guidance and immense care I delivered my baby girl via c section. Surgery was super smooth without any complications. Post discharge she was constantly in touch with me checked upon me and my new born. She also guided me on breastfeeding.A big Thank You to Dr. Poonam. Me and my husband strongly recommend her ** **** ************ *** ************ for pregancy journey.",

We first met Doc in Apr'19 when me and my husband wanted to start trying to build our family. We met her for prenatal education and by Aug'19, we had conceived. But during our 12th week NT scan, we were told that the baby had Acrania/Anencephaly. The skull wasn't fully developed and would never be. It is a condition that isn't compatible with life. We were told to opt for MTP or Medically Terminated Pregnancy and the very next went to Criticare Andheri for the procedure. Though it's a small surgical procedure, usually conducted at OPD, Doc ensured we got the OT so that nothing was amiss. She even suggested we send the fetus for genetic testing, just to be sure it won't be a recurrent issue. We were heartbroken, as any to-be would be, but Doc stood by us super strong and kept giving me the assurance that things will look up. After a month, we conceived again, and this time Doc was super protective of us. Increased number of scans, lesser travel (lockdown helped in that one as well), energy rich diet, walking and exercising. And everytime we spoke to her, she became less of a Doc and more of a friend. I remember when I was detected with short cervix at 26 weeks and suggested bedrest along with steroid shots for fetus' lung development, Doc actually came to my house and gave me the shot just so I don't have to travel till the clinic for it. Such small gestures leaves such deep impact! After my c-sec, I recovered so so well within 2 days, could carry my bub and walk in the hospital corridor. She taught me how to latch, while my other new mum friends struggled with it. And surprisingly, my son refuses to go to anyone other than us and Doc. She is more than our doctor, she has been our friend, our savior",

Just 1 year we shifted from another city and immediately consulted her online and started our journey and finally she helped us deliver our baby starting from planning to conceiving to delivering. In this whole journey of 1 year she has been wonderful at every moment. She is friendly, helpful, patience, caring, supporting, extremely knowledgeable, approachable. She is reachable 24*7. Hats off to this lady who has given her heart and soul to her profession for the love of her patients. She owns every case and leaves no stone unturned to make sure her patients get the solution for which they visited her. Ours was a normal family planning and pregnancy journey and she was with us every second we needed her. We are lucky that she was the one to deliver our baby. *** ** ****** ******* ** ******* *** *** ****** *** ********* ** ***. She is highly highly experienced doctor yet she is with no arrogance, very humble. We are extremely extremely thankful to her for her support and presence in our journey and she is highly recommended for all planning to consult for pregnancy or any gynaec related issues. My words will fall short for all the appreciation to her and we can convey our deep gratitude towards her support.  Anyone reading this review, please do consult her if you looking for some real solution to your queries. ",

The event was extremely traumatic for both of us. So the second time, we were quite concerned about getting a good obstetrician, especially who can manage the deep set fear and trauma of my wife, and help us conclude the pregnancy successfully. \n\nWe searched in Practo, and found Dr Poonam, amongst a few others. But we liked her profile since there were many good reviews about her. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 9 months since we have been interacting with Dr Poonam. During the course of time, she managed to create an environment of safety and trust for my wife, through consultations to the extent that my wife got deeply attached to her emotionally. In this time interval of 9 months there have been times where Dr Poonam was unavailable for physical consultation for a couple of weeks. But she provided us with a backup doctor to handle any emergencies. Even while she was travelling, Dr Poonam was still always available for telephonic consultations. Hats off to her dedication. Her concern for my wife seemed similar to her own daughter. \n\nWe are now the happy parents of a newborn baby. The baby was born in Surya Hospitals via Cesarean (because of the previous mishap we didn\u2019t want to take chances). Prior to the surgery, Dr Poonam had let us talk to one of her patients who had just delivered via Cesarean to check how easy or difficult it is to recover after a Cesarean, and associated first hand experiences.\n\nDr Poonam helped us with the hospitalisation. She also explained to us that we might need an attendant for the mother and baby post operation and gave us references for attendants. She was extremely supportive for all our requests. She got her own team to perform the operation. It was done at the exact time of our choice, the surgery went perfectly well. She even invited me to be there physically in the operating theatre so that I could provide emotional support to my wife during the surgery. I have found Dr Poonam extremely thoughtful and sensitive in these matters - she comprehends these innate needs of a to-be-parent couple so easily. Her emotional intelligence must be extremely high. \n\nThe operation has gone very well. My wife recovered extremely fast from the operation and was mobile within a couple of days (we thought it would be weeks). \n\nIn a world where there are so many reckless doctors (like the one we had the misfortune to consult for our first baby), it is doctors like Dr Poonam who bring back our faith for the medical profession. \n\nI am humbly thankful, grateful, and fortunate, as a husband and a parent, to have been blessed with an angel like Dr Poonam. \n\nFor any expectant mother / father, I will highly recommend Dr Poonam - you will be in very safe hands, and I am talking from the perspective of a first hand wonderful experience.",

She is ALWAYS available via phone for any question or doubt. Throughout my journey I did ask her a lot of questions and she patiently responded to all. My husband and I really liked that she is extremely meticulous and leaves nothing to chance. I felt really secure throughout my pregnancy as I knew I was in good hands.\nI spoke to her about my preference for normal delivery during the last trimester and she made that happen for me. She told me exercises to help me achieve that and on the day of delivery there were unforeseen challenges for a normal delivery but she waited patiently and made it possible for me. I am really really thankful to her.\nAfter delivery she counselled me on how to feed and set my time according to my child.\nWe found in her a true friend, philosopher and guide. I would definitely recommend her to all my friends.",

It was a smooth experience for all of us including my family and every small thing wrt to me and my baby we're meticulously taken care of!!\nShe is more than a Doctor...kind, friendly, approachable, available, comforting and God sent angel for you and your family!!",

We couldn't have chosen a better doctor than poonam madam. Infact post our 1st visit we didn't even felt like we were visiting a doctor. Her such detail & in-depth intervention into our case is simply unmatched & unparalleled to any doctor. My wife was very hopeful to have a normal delivery & she(doctor) tried her level best to have a normal delivery ofcourse within the limits of any danger.We(Hodiwala's) shall always be thankful to her for all the medical & most important emotional & mental suppport than she extended towards us. As per me her biggest quality is her down to earth approach towards every case & her immense experience towards her feild. Actually we almost feel like spoilt kids as now our expectation from each & every doctor would be the same. Hence its certain we are surely up for some dissapointments in future :)A hug & thank you from our precious lil princess \"Joyce\" :)Looking forward to host you at our house for the brunch we discussed :)Wish you all the Good Health & God Speed.\u00a0- Adil Rumy Hodiwala.",

We used to check on internet regarding complications with the twin pregnancy and bombard her with all the queries where she used to patiently answer us. I used to be so tensed on our visit but after meeting her I used to feel positive and elated. In truth She is a HEALER. She monitored my condition so closely that I used to feel she is a part of my family. \nNow my whole family including my Mom is a great fan of Dr. Poonam. \nBeing pregnant in itself is a miracle and the journey can make u miserable with all nausea and vomiting but if you want to make it enjoyable I would recommend to have a strong and positive partner like Dr. Poonam.\nThank you so much Dr. Poonam.",

She is a doctor who has that patience,positivity and honesty which keeps you confident while taking the treatment and gives you the assurance where half of your issues are gone. From the day I visited her first, three years back and from that point I found a friend in her and will always be that. ",

Subsequently I was operated by her, and during the operation looking at her skills and the way she deftly handled everything, I was happy that I am in safe hands.

Also, my pregnancy was difficult due to existing medical conditions and complications that I developed in the second trimester. Doctor Poonam took the time to understand my medical history and recommended a safe way forward. One of the things that I like most about her is that she listened to all my concerns patiently and addressed each one in detail. She ensured that at no point was I overwhelmed. She delivered my little one a week back and I couldn\u2019t be more thankful to her. \nI would highly recommend Doctor Poonam. \n",

The best thing about dr poonam is that you can speak very freely with her and she patiently listens to your problems and explains you the issue and how she can help you treat it. She is one of the few doctors who are always available to help the patient when in need and doubt even over the phone. For my pregnancy also I was consulting Dr Poonam who helped me really well in my maternity journey by guiding me and always being available to clear any doubts I had. Thanks to Dr Poonam\u2019s guidance I have been able to deliver a healthy Baby Girl. ",

She is a very friendly doctor who will listen to all your concerns and advise you accordingly. Under her supervision and care pregnancy which is one of the most crucial and vulnerable phase in a woman's life, felt like a joy ride and was very smooth. She always available for her patients at any hour of day or night. If you have any queries or concerns, she is merely a call or text away. I felt very secure during my entire pregnancy. I didn't need to worry about anything. She didn't advise any unnecessary tests and scans and will always keep up updated on future course of action. She is a very mature and responsible doctor. She will never prescribed any unnecessary extra medicines. I delivered a baby boy and am very happy about the way she handled my delivery and post delivery care. Would recommend the doctor to anyone for any gynocological issue. ",

What I like the most is the fact that whenever there is any issue the doctor would try to address the worst case scenario (and try to identify and eliminate the most difficult conditions) first and then work to identifying lesser issues which may arise from same diagnosis. There is nothing left to chance and as you will realize during the pregnancy there are many things that will come up and will require someone who patiently addresses the conxerns without compromising on the time required either for diagnosis or discussions with the patient. My wife is extremely satisfied and we are glad that she is our gynaecologist.",

Initially, I visited her for UTI and she did not only prescribed the treatment but also  helped me understand implication of my overweight and motivated me to work on that. I had read reviews on Practo before I met her and trust me once you meet her you'll find all of the reviews underrated, including the one I'm writing now.\nIn our first meet, I ended up discussing my next two year plan of baby. Unfortunately, during my UTI treatment, I realised I had to visit her for MTP. She was very supportive and explained the processes in detail to both of us. Through the treatment of MTP, I faced other smaller concerns like palpitations but she was very proactive to consult senior cardiologist for me. \nLong story short, Dr. Poonam is one rare example who is just a call away. She wouldn't sleep until she makes sure you're okay, and would go an extra mile to make it easier for you.",
