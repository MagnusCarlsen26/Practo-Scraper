I would highly recommend all of my friends and family to seek an appointment with Dr Sangeeta,  should they ever need a medical intervention for a gynecology/ obstetrics issue. \n\n",

Through the entire 9 months Dr. Sangeeta was consistently very approachable and friendly - addressing all our doubts and anxieties patiently. I always found her very calm and positive in all the interactions.\n\nShe has the approach of pregnancy being a very normal physiological process for a woman and should be treated as such. This approach helped me have a very smooth pregnancy while enjoying my normal life - including office work with minimum restrictions and medications.\n\nI was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes and low amniotic fluid levels (Oligohydramnios) during my pregnancy. Due to detection and intervention at the right time, we were able to mitigate the impact of both and still proceed to have a normal delivery.***** ***** ****** *** **** ** **** ******* *** experienced and but also very motivated to help her patients achieve their goals while ensuring their well being.\nWe had expressed to her early on during the pregnancy that we were keen on having a normal delivery. However due to GD and Oligohydramnios it was actually a high risk pregnancy and I would probably have been advised a caeserean by any other doctor.\nHowever, thanks to the calculated risks taken by Dr. Sangeeta during my labour, we were able to have a normal delivery.\n\nIn addition, she had gone out of her way to help us select the hospital taking into account the financials and our medical needs. Also, she had personally reached out to us to counsel during the Covid wave 2 about the vaccinations.\n\nI completely owe my very smooth pregnancy and delivery experience to Dr. Sangeeta Raodeo and would definitely recommend her.\n",

She advised USG and Imaging, based on which her analysis was partly correct. The issue was adnexal cyst, which was causing the pain, in addition to external fibroids on uterus.\n\nDr advised us to go for removal of both, since the uterus would have caused problems later (as had been the case with my cousin sister). From there on, Dr was available for consultation and guidance up to Surgery. She even explained the various possibilities that can happen after surgery, so that we are mentally prepared to handle the same.\n\nOn the admission day, Dr came to the room and patiently explained all the details again and answered some of our queries. Post-surgery, she called us to the room and explained the various actions taken during the surgery. \n\nOverall, a neighborhood doctor, smiling and confident, that we can confide on her and ask even the silliest of the questions to get it answered. I would recommend her to my friends & relatives.",

She not only give me moral support during my hard times but she totaly ensures that my complications get resolved and my body will be ready for next pregnancy. Recently we blessed with a baby girl and we owe our child to her. She was there with me for all nine months of pregnacy and treated me like a friend. She answered all our queries with the smiling face and explained all the issues very well in detail. Before delivery she explained each and every point of delivery expenses and precautions. She is always ready to receive a call and provide us her support. It is rare to find a doctor who combines excellent medical care with such compassionate regards for her patients. So we are very thankfull to her for providing extended support during this pandemic time. She is an extraordinary doctor and highly recommended for those who are planning for the baby. Thanks maam for making us proud parents and i always feel greatful to have u as my gynecologist.",

She is one of the few doctors who is very professional yet approachable enough to make you feel comfortable to ask all your queries and patiently answers them all . She is always smiling and puts you at ease with her calm and pleasant demeanour. She gave us sound advice at every followup. She also tried to do normal delivery till the end, something not commonly seen. However, we had to go for emergency C-section due to some last moment complications and she was there within minutes to handle it and deliver our baby despite it being past midnight hour.  Overall, we could not have asked for a better gynaec and forever grateful for her support throughout the 9 months. Strongly recommend her to all pregnant women for their check up and delivery.",

Despite issues like GDM and high  BP, along with a cerclage, I was able to carry the baby till 37 weeks, all thanks to Dr Sangeeta and her team.

Through the entire 9 months Dr. Sangeeta was consistently very approachable and friendly - addressing all our doubts and anxieties patiently. I always found her very calm and positive in all the interactions.\n\nShe has the approach of pregnancy being a very normal physiological process for a woman and should be treated as such. This approach helped me have a very smooth pregnancy while enjoying my normal life - including office work with minimum restrictions and medications.\n\nI was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes and low amniotic fluid levels (Oligohydramnios) during my pregnancy. Due to detection and intervention at the right time, we were able to mitigate the impact of both and still proceed to have a normal delivery.***** ***** ****** *** **** ** **** ******* *** experienced and but also very motivated to help her patients achieve their goals while ensuring their well being.\nWe had expressed to her early on during the pregnancy that we were keen on having a normal delivery. However due to GD and Oligohydramnios it was actually a high risk pregnancy and I would probably have been advised a caeserean by any other doctor.\nHowever, thanks to the calculated risks taken by Dr. Sangeeta during my labour, we were able to have a normal delivery.\n\nIn addition, she had gone out of her way to help us select the hospital taking into account the financials and our medical needs. Also, she had personally reached out to us to counsel during the Covid wave 2 about the vaccinations.\n\nI completely owe my very smooth pregnancy and delivery experience to Dr. Sangeeta Raodeo and would definitely recommend her.\n",

We went to Dr. Sangeeta based on feedback from Practo. \n\nInitial Observation: Dr. Sangeeta immediately pointed out that the uterus is big and is the cause of the issue. She advised USG and Imaging, based on which her analysis was partly correct. The issue was adnexal cyst, which was causing the pain, in addition to external fibroids on uterus.\n\nDr advised us to go for removal of both, since the uterus would have caused problems later (as had been the case with my cousin sister). From there on, Dr was available for consultation and guidance up to Surgery. She even explained the various possibilities that can happen after surgery, so that we are mentally prepared to handle the same.\n\nOn the admission day, Dr came to the room and patiently explained all the details again and answered some of our queries. Post-surgery, she called us to the room and explained the various actions taken during the surgery. \n\nOverall, a neighborhood doctor, smiling and confident, that we can confide on her and ask even the silliest of the questions to get it answered. I would recommend her to my friends & relatives.",

She not only give me moral support during my hard times but she totaly ensures that my complications get resolved and my body will be ready for next pregnancy. Recently we blessed with a baby girl and we owe our child to her. She was there with me for all nine months of pregnacy and treated me like a friend. She answered all our queries with the smiling face and explained all the issues very well in detail. Before delivery she explained each and every point of delivery expenses and precautions. She is always ready to receive a call and provide us her support. It is rare to find a doctor who combines excellent medical care with such compassionate regards for her patients. So we are very thankfull to her for providing extended support during this pandemic time. She is an extraordinary doctor and highly recommended for those who are planning for the baby. Thanks maam for making us proud parents and i always feel greatful to have u as my gynecologist.",

She is always smiling and puts you at ease with her calm and pleasant demeanour. She gave us sound advice at every followup.

However, we had to go for emergency C-section due to some last moment complications and she was there within minutes to handle it and deliver our baby despite it being past midnight hour.  Overall, we could not have asked for a better gynaec and forever grateful for her support throughout the 9 months. Strongly recommend her to all pregnant women for their check up and delivery.",

Despite issues like GDM and high  BP, along with a cerclage, I was able to carry the baby till 37 weeks, all thanks to Dr Sangeeta and her team.  I delivered through C section and the entire experience was very comforting because Dr Raodeo gave us the confidence boost we needed time and again.",

Approached Dr Sangeeta for \"Online consulting\". One of the best decision so far. She made my chattering mind calm despite of it being filled with zillion questions. Very positive, approachable, sensitive ( which is most important thing I was looking for) and someone who had good time available for my story. Met her when in India and I wished either her to be in hk to handhold me during pregnancy or myself to be in mumbai just for her! :) Thank you Dr Raodeo. ",

My wife underwent treatment for PCOS by an exceptional Doctor: Dr. Sangeeta Raodeo. The doctor not only identified the root cause but also worked with us to evaluate first and second line of treatment in a cost effective and timely manner. When we saw the benefits, we opted for a more direct intervention and the doctor pulled all ends together to ensure the surgery was completed over a weekend and my wife could rest and recuperate to join normal routine ASAP. \n\nThe hospital staff was courteous and costs were under control. I used my company insurance and therefore the procedures were covered under cashless option. \n\nPost op follow up has been timely and helpful.\n\nIf you are coming to Fortis for gynaec treatment, look.no further than Dr. Sangeeta Raodeo. The doctor has won award in her field and is down to earth and spends time answering your questions ... Rare to find such doctor in gynaecology when everyone else just wants to work on easy cases, low hanging fruits.",

Her explanations were easy to understand and interpret. She was available to us all of the times to answer silliest of the questions, comfor highest levels of anxiety and guide at crucial of the times. Post pregnancy care was well taken care of leaving us with the best of the memories of this wonderful phase of pregnancy. Could not have asked for more! ",
