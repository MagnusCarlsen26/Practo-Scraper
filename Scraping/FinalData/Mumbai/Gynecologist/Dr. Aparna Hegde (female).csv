I want to express my gratitude for the care I received from you. I was very impressed by the kindness and professionalism you and your staff showed.  a special thank you to the doctor for being so good at what you do. I will never forget what you did for me.
My name is PRASAD MUNDHE. I traveled from Yeola to visit Dr. Aparna Hegde at Surya Hospital, MUMBAI SANTA CRUZ, for my recurring urine problem I am just 17 years old and I was suffering from urine problems my urine was stopped for 4 months, and for many days I had used urine bag and after some days I had started self catheter and many doctors had told me that we have to do surgery but DR ANITA PATEL referred me to meet Aparna maan and as she told imminently I visited aperna maam and after visiting her She encouraged me to not do surgery and go for physiotherapy instead. This helped me save money and work on my health naturally, via exercises the first day she told me to stop my all tablets and go form only exercises and she told me to do physiotherapy 15 times after that when I started it 3 to 4 times after I started my urine naturally and now I am feeling better than before so I would prefer if someone is having such type of problem or any type of urine related u must visit Aparna maam and ONCE MORE THANK U MAAM FOR YOUR GREAT WORK

I have no words to express my gratitude towards her. The lady in whose house I work in has translated this into English as I feel my story needs to be told. I am only 36 years old and I had my second delivery seven years ago. Since then my pelvic organs started dropping through my vagina. I did not do anything about it for the first few years and then because of covid I could not access care. In the last three years, my uterus, bladder and rectum, all prolapsed out of the vagina. After a few months, the prolapse was so big that it could not be pushed back in. Over the next year, ulcers formed on the prolapse and it was obstructing my urethra and I could not empty my bladder. It became unbearable and I was in severe pain and I could not sit or stand. I could not afford treatment and hence I went to Cama Hospital for treatment. There I was admitted under the Gynecology department. They took me into the operation theatre and gave anesthesia but they did not operate as it was a very difficult case. They extubated me and then gave some medicines hoping that the prolapse would reduce and the ulcers would heal. After 20 days, they again took me into the operation theatre.  Again the senior doctor felt that it was too difficult. Because I was under anesthesia for the second time, they had to call a senior highly accomplished doctor to perfom the surgery  And so they called Dr. Aparna Hegde who offers free service as an honorary Professor of  Urogynecology at Cama Hospital every morning. She performed the difficult surgery very well even though the first time she was seeing me was in the operation theatre under anesthesia. I was really relieved post surgery.. However, because my bladder was not emptying properly for many years, post surgery when Dr. Hegde tried to remove the catheter, I could not pee. Dr. Hegde hadn't seen me pre-surgery as she was called to see me for the first time when I was under anesthesia. And hence she could not assess the condition of my bladder and kidneys pre-surgery. And hence it was very difficult for Dr. Hegde to provide optimal treatment for my bladder and kidneys post surgery. She rightly diagnosed that because of long standing retention of urine due to untreated prolapse, my bladder muscle had been damaged and also there was back pressure changes exerted on my kidneys.  However, no one had done any tests on me pre surgery to determine the status of my bladder and kidneys. Even though  it was really difficult, Dr. Hegde provided the right treatment. She kept me on catheter for a month to give rest to the bladder and then she performed biofeedback therapy weekly for relaxation free of charge for me as my pelvic muscles were also not relaxing while peeing. It was a very difficult journey, but now I have completely recovered only because of Dr. Hegde. 
She has come as an angel into my life. She was very kind and spent a lot of time with me to guide me through the difficult process though I could not pay her much money for any of the treatment she provided. She said it was her mission to help me get better because I had suffered so much. She is very soft-hearted and communicates the last details with her patients with patience and holds their hand through difficult treatments. I am so lucky that I met Dr. Hegde as otherwise my life would have been very difficult. And I would have been on lifelong catheter. My kidneys were distended with fluid and now they have also completely recovered due to Dr. Hegde's competence. I will be eternally grateful to her for saving my life. 
In the end, i want to say that all women with prolapse should consult Urogynecologists like Dr. Hegde because they not only assess the prolapse but also co-existing urinary and bowel problems before surgery. And provide treatment for that too. De. Hegde is a great surgeon and doctor and I recommend every patient to consult her for prolapse and bowel and bladder problems.

My mother suffered from immense pain in the lower region of her abdomen for many many years. We approached so many doctors but nothing worked.

She was very depressed hearing this and she was in a bad state for many years. We did not know what to do. We had also exhausted all our financial resources. We met Dr. Hegde when we had given up all hope. Things immediately transformed when we met her. Her warmth and kindness gave hope to my mother for the first time after many years.

Dr. Hegde is the best doctor we have ever met  The only procedure my mother had to undergo was cystoscopy. And all other treatment was non-operative. My mother had a severe problem peeing in addition to the pain. Dr. Hegde explained that it is because her pelvic muscles were contracted in response to the pain.  Dr. Hegde did biofeedback therapy for my mother weekly in which she was taught how to keep her lower muscles relaxed. It was really helpful as the spasm in the muscles was responsible partly for the severe pain. My mother also was put on a strict diet and several medication to rebuild the lining of her bladder.
 My mother is pain-free now and goes for walks in the evening and has regained a good quality of life. We understand that the condition is chronic but we are confident that under the guidance of Dr. Hegde, my mother will have a good life. ",2022-09-10 06:15:04,False,True,Sitadevi Yadav,,,

I do not have words to express my gratitude to Dr. Hegde. She is a genius. I am from Nepal and have been suffering from leaking of urine since many years. A few years ago, another doctor had performed a botched surgery that failed. The leaking or urine increased and had made my life really difficult. I would smell of urine daily. Even if I moved a little, i would leak a lot.  I was very frustrated. 

I visited many senior doctors and it was very difficult to find the right solution. Then someone recommended that I visit Dr. Hegde. She is a pioneer in three dimensional ultrasound of the pelvis and she can do sonography to understand where the previous sling is located and why it is causing problems. I was told that she is the only one who could diagnose what was going wrong and give the right treatment. 

Dr. Hegde was very kind, warm and patient. She questioned me in a very detailed manner and understood the problem thoroughly. She did ultrasound and found out the position of the previous sling. She said that when i coughed, the sling was pulling apart the neck of the bladder increasing leak. She said that a repeat surgery would be needed to remove the previous sling and to take care of the leak. I had major financial issues and she was very considerate about that. She did a test called Urodynamics at very low cost to understand every issue with my bladder. She performed the surgery in the Government Hospital in Mumbai for free where she does charity work every morning. 
The care was really considerate even though it was in a government hospital. I am very lucky that Dr. Hegde entered my life. She is truly a boon to society. She does charity work through her NGO also which is working throughout India. Please look up online and you will be amazed at her dedication to the women and children of India.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,",,0,0,YES,"So my problem started 1 year back... i had burning enough to not let me sleep... and frequency..
It was diagnosed as a urinary infection and my saga of anitibiotics started.
the problem did not disapear and with every week passing my anxiety increased.. In the process i changed multiple doctors as i did not get correct diagnosis or treatment..I was told that its in my mind or i am not particular with my hygiene but believe my after 6 months of NONSTOP burning  i was trying it all..
i was asking doctors do i have bladder pain syndrome and they all refused.. 
Finally one doctor suggested a cystoscopy and diagnosed me with bladder pain syndrome. However the treatment was soo superficial..  I was adviced cystopen and to eat less spicy and less oily.. The joke is that i never ate spicy or oily. After this I got a bad flare in 1 month and i could not get thru the doctor for 3 days..after 3 days when i met him he said u have to live with this... from a group in india i got dr aparna hegdes number..
the first time i went to meet her i was very anxious cause she was my last ray of hope to get my original life back.. She saw me and understood what i was undergoing. She patiently explained me the whole problem and the treatment.. her approach was to treat my whole body and repair it from the roots..
She was the only doctor amongst the NINE doctors i met who agreed there is an actual problem.. i was adviced 
bladder instillations 
a strict diet 
physiotherapy(biofeedback by maple only done by her)
6 months down the treatment i can say i have got a new way of life which is healthier and not unpredictable healthwise..
SHe is there to guide to me 24 by 7.. 
She was firm with me and at times i was fedup but believe me it was for my good at the end of the day..
I was scared to go to work also but after her treatment i did a 15 day travel and i was very comfortable..
Any bladder issue I highly recommend DR APARNA HEGDE who really gave me a new life a healthier life.",2020-03-20 09:39:07,False,True,Ruchits Shah,,,

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Urinary Incontinence (Ui) Treatment,",0,0,YES,it was the most wonderful experience to have met Dr. Hegde. She is the best doctor I have ever met. I had problems emptying my bladder. A few times I just could not pee and my bladder bloated up with over 1000 ml of urine. This led to damage to my bladder muscle as a result of which I was having overflow of urine and leakage. I was put on catheter for weeks endlessly by various doctors which led to several bladder infection episodes and severe pain. I was suffering so much.  Several doctors dilated my urethra but the problem would recur in a few months. No doctor could diagnose my problem. At that time I was referred to Dr. Hegde who performed Urodynamics and diagnosed that I had the problem that I was not relaxing my pelvis and the urethra while peeing which led to the problem. She was really kind and patient when she explained the problem to me. Half my worries were resolved just by talking to her. She did biofeedback therapy for relaxation for me and my problem is completely resolved.  I am extremely grateful to Dr. Hegde. God bless her! ,2022-11-26 05:15:15,False,True,Shaheeda Banu,,,

She is the most wonderful doctor I have ever met. Not only is she exceptional at her work, but is very warm, humble and patient. She gave me a lot of time to explain my problem and answered all my queries calmly explaining very complex scientific things in simple language. I felt very supported through the whole process. She is very thorough in her work and leaves nothing unattended. And so I developed complete faith in her abilities. She was very considerate even about my financial issues.  I had prolapse of my uterus, bladder and rectum. I met many doctors before her and I was not convinced of the treatment options they were offering me. In the first visit itself, I realised how systematic Dr. Aparna is. She was very detail-oriented and did proper examination to understand where the problem was. She uncovered the fact that i had the problem of leaking of urine on cough also which no other doctor had diagnosed. She said that the prolapse was pressing on the urethra and hence the leaking was not apparent. But pushing back the prolapse showed clearly that i had leaking of urine also. She explained all the options and worked with me to choose the best option for surgery. The surgery process was very smooth. And there was hardly any pain post surgery. She made me feel very comfortable through the whooe stay in the hospital. I am very grateful. After three months, she will be doing biofeedback therapy to strengthen my pelvic muscles. I believe that this therapy is not offered by most doctors and is necessary to ensure proper support to my pelvis. All the best Dr. Hegde for all the work you do for humanity. I saw online that you are the founder of a very nice NGO that works through out India to improve the lives of mothers and children. You are truly a great doctor and surgeon.

As a child, I've had several episodes where I was put on frequent antibiotics. After marriage as well, I had several episodes and a few where I was hospitalized. At about 42 years of age, I realized that I had been dealing with this issue for too long and something about the way I was treated wasn't right. I found Dr Aparna on Practo and right from the first appointment I knew that she truly understood what I was going through. She recommended a cystoscopy which threw up an inflamed bladder situation. So all this while, I thought I had bacterial infections, but in reality it was something else altogether. Dr Hegde prescribed a rigorous treatment for 6 months. To begin with, I was scared and in denial. I felt like I didn't need to go under such treatment and went into hibernation for about a month. in that period, I went through the flares again and visited her again to only fully accept and go through the entire treatment procedure that she was earlier recommending. after about 6 months, I can say that I'm a lot better. I understand my condition a lot more than I did 6 months back. I've also accepted this as a part of my life and have been actively working towards relieving my flares whenever they crop up. Dr Aparna Hegde has been a godsend to me. She is the right measure of empathetic   strict that one could ask for in a doctor. She has been extremely patient with me and all my questions and idiosyncrasies. She has a wealth of experience and has put it to excellent use with all the community service that she does. I admire her in a lot of ways and I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone who is facing urinary tract or bladder related issues. ",2021-08-19 09:02:30,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

As a doctor, I really care about my patients, and I would love to provide the best care to every patient patiently and with warmth. All other reviews on practo testify that I try my best for them. And so, I regret the misunderstanding here. 
But there is a context to every situation and your review does not give that context which I am recounting here: 

-  I video called you at the exact time of the consultation which you describe as being in an absolute hurry. You had not written on the chat that you wanted to send any reports there before I called, so I was unaware of the same. Practo insists that we call on time. It starts sending messages and calling three minutes before the consultation time to say that a patient is waiting. And hence I video called on time. I don’t understand the issue here. 

-	I mentioned that I am in a hospital because I was faced with a medical emergency that day. An elderly patient of mine was in an emergency that was unforeseen, and I had been called down to see her. I was genuinely pressed for time that day. Yet I called at the designated time. And I told you that I was in the hospital dealing with a patient. 

-	Only when we spoke I realized that you had called for a menstrual problem. It is clearly written in my bio that I am a Urogynecologist. I have been exclusively practicing Urogynecology since my fellowship.  I do not practice general gynecology at all. There is no way a doctor can know why a patient has booked an appointment until the call. 

-	You had a longstanding menstrual problem for which you had consulted multiple doctors in Delhi in the past. It was apparent immediately that you needed in-person consultation which I told you clearly. You said you were fine with coming in for an in-person consultation. 

-	I live in Mumbai and my bio on practo clearly mentions that Dr. Karishma Thariani looks after our Delhi center. Since you needed an in-person consultation and you live in Delhi, I recommended you visit Dr. Karishma Thariani as she is an excellent doctor and looks after menstrual problems in addition to being a Urogynecologist. I said clearly that you need an examination before medicines could be given. And you agreed to visit Dr. Thariani. Another reason I recommended Dr. Thariani is that when patients have already paid on practo for a video consultation, we give them free service when they come for a in -person consultation.",2022-08-31T10:18:51+0000,Dr. Aparna Hegde
