Dr. Aditi who was attending to me post operation is also a very knowledgeable and humble person.

She is a very helpful, knowledgeable and a person who is willing to go an extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction. Also, another person we met was Hemal who also had the same qualities.

It would be unfair if I don't mention about the hospital staff - i.e. the  Sisters, Mawshi's and other hospital staff. They all were very attentive, supportive and helpful all the time I stayed at the hospital.

The food... how can I forget this. Right from morning tea, breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner...It was the most sattvic, delicious , filling and homemade food that I ever had. The attendant who accompanies the patient also is served the same food.
