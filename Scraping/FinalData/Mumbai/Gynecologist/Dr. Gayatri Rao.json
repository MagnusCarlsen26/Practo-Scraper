She handled my case really well.Actually, my own gynaecologist was out of town during the week of my delivery and in her absence I was referred for a C-section by the team of assistant doctors of my gynaecologist, since I was diagnosed with Oligoamnios due to low amniotic fluid level in the last week of pregnancy. This created anxiety and a state of panic, as everything was on track for a normal delivery until the last scan done in week 36 of my pregnancy. We then began to look elsewhere in the hope of a normal delivery. I was then given a very strong recommendation of Dr. Gayatri Rao by my sister-in-law who had a normal delivery under her supervision, despite a critical pregnancy.So, we rushed to Womens Hospital for an emergency consultation and delivery by Dr. Gayatri Rao as I was already past my due date into week 41 and had gone into early labour. She responded to our late night emergency call and visited us at the hospital as soon as possible despite us having no prior appointment with her. After meeting her, we immediately realised that we were in the best hands. She assessed and explained the best possible outcome of my case with a calm composure. She tried all possible methods in the next 26 hours to induce and dilate for a normal delivery. By the grace of God and expertise of Dr. Gayatri Rao and team, I had a normal delivery and am blessed with a healthy baby girl.A big shoutout to the staff and team of doctors at Womens Hospital as well, as they worked tirelessly for pulling off something no less than a miracle. I have not seen or heard of any doctor who has displayed so much patience in pursuit of a normal delivery under such critical circumstances.I highly recommend Dr. Gayatri Rao and Womens Hospital for expertise on pregnancy related cases. Thank you so much Doctor, you are an angel indeed!",

Since it's a once in a lifetime experience, you want everything to be great and perfect and not just the doctors but the support staff ensure that you have an even better experience than you can imagine. I can't stop raving about the Dr. Gayatri Rao and how confident and calm she always was every time we saw her. She always made us realize that everything is under control and that would give us a world of confidence. Even Dr. Manju Sinha, who is the owner of the hospital is always around and keeps comforting you. when our baby was born, Dr. Manju Sinha herself clicked atleast 150 pictures for us. something we had completely forgotten but are now one of best captured memories. All the sisters and support staff are extremely helpful *** ************* and would always be around to take care of the baby and the way they take care of the baby, you can sense that they are not just doing it as a job but they are genuinely caring. There was not a single instance where I felt that anyone is trying to inflate the bill or trying anything smart. The hospital also has a very beautiful cafeteria and serve very good homely food which they offer without any charges to all attendants. I had never had better food than that in a hospital. Finally, just want to say that I really loved the experience and would highly recommend this hospital and Dr. Gayatri Rao if you are looking for a gynaecologist or a hospital for delivery. You wouldn't regret it!! ",

The doctor, the team, this place, the whole process, it was filled with divine energy. I felt so loved and protected in the OT by all the doctors and staff. I was informed at each step what is going to happen next with me. Each and every person at the hospital is so dedictaed to the well being of the mother and the baby. The care at Womens Hospital is so homely yet a zillion times better than even home. The care is way beyond expectations and I am indebted to them for life for this gift and the love and warmth received. Words won\u2019t be enough!

Dr Manju Sinha helped me relax before the anesthesia and even took our first pictures with the baby. She even made sure to meet us before the discharge to make sure we were doing okay. Hats off to the entire team including the support staff in the wards. All in all I would definitely recommend Dr Gayatri and Women's hospital to everyone I know.",

                "review_text": "Dr. Gayatri Rao is a gem of a person. She handled my case really well.Actually, my own gynaecologist was out of town during the week of my delivery and in her absence I was referred for a C-section by the team of assistant doctors of my gynaecologist, since I was diagnosed with Oligoamnios due to low amniotic fluid level in the last week of pregnancy. This created anxiety and a state of panic, as everything was on track for a normal delivery until the last scan done in week 36 of my pregnancy. We then began to look elsewhere in the hope of a normal delivery. I was then given a very strong recommendation of Dr. Gayatri Rao by my sister-in-law who had a normal delivery under her supervision, despite a critical pregnancy.So, we rushed to Womens Hospital for an emergency consultation and delivery by Dr. Gayatri Rao as I was already past my due date into week 41 and had gone into early labour. She responded to our late night emergency call and visited us at the hospital as soon as possible despite us having no prior appointment with her. After meeting her, we immediately realised that we were in the best hands. She assessed and explained the best possible outcome of my case with a calm composure. She tried all possible methods in the next 26 hours to induce and dilate for a normal delivery. By the grace of God and expertise of Dr. Gayatri Rao and team, I had a normal delivery and am blessed with a healthy baby girl.A big shoutout to the staff and team of doctors at Womens Hospital as well, as they worked tirelessly for pulling off something no less than a miracle. I have not seen or heard of any doctor who has displayed so much patience in pursuit of a normal delivery under such critical circumstances.I highly recommend Dr. Gayatri Rao and Womens Hospital for expertise on pregnancy related cases. Thank you so much Doctor, you are an angel indeed!",

Since it's a once in a lifetime experience, you want everything to be great and perfect and not just the doctors but the support staff ensure that you have an even better experience than you can imagine. I can't stop raving about the Dr. Gayatri Rao and how confident and calm she always was every time we saw her. She always made us realize that everything is under control and that would give us a world of confidence. Even Dr. Manju Sinha, who is the owner of the hospital is always around and keeps comforting you. when our baby was born, Dr. Manju Sinha herself clicked atleast 150 pictures for us. something we had completely forgotten but are now one of best captured memories. All the sisters and support staff are extremely helpful *** ************* and would always be around to take care of the baby and the way they take care of the baby, you can sense that they are not just doing it as a job but they are genuinely caring. There was not a single instance where I felt that anyone is trying to inflate the bill or trying anything smart. The hospital also has a very beautiful cafeteria and serve very good homely food which they offer without any charges to all attendants. I had never had better food than that in a hospital. Finally, just want to say that I really loved the experience and would highly recommend this hospital and Dr. Gayatri Rao if you are looking for a gynaecologist or a hospital for delivery. You wouldn't regret it!! ",

The doctor, the team, this place, the whole process, it was filled with divine energy. I felt so loved and protected in the OT by all the doctors and staff. I was informed at each step what is going to happen next with me. Each and every person at the hospital is so dedictaed to the well being of the mother and the baby. The care at Womens Hospital is so homely yet a zillion times better than even home. The care is way beyond expectations and I am indebted to them for life for this gift and the love and warmth received. Words won\u2019t be enough! God bless her and everyone at the hospital with umpteen happiness and choicest blessings. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u2665\ufe0f Lots of love and my warmest regards. \ud83d\udc95",

I'm so glad I chose her for my pregnancy journey and women's hospital too as I feel I couldn't have had a better delivery experience. Every single person in the operation theatre was so supportive. Dr Manju Sinha helped me relax before the anesthesia and even took our first pictures with the baby. She even made sure to meet us before the discharge to make sure we were doing okay. Hats off to the entire team including the support staff in the wards. All in all I would definitely recommend Dr Gayatri and Women's hospital to everyone I know.",

My experience with Dr. Shweta's treatment was very smooth going and seamless. She listens to the patients and gives the  couples the best advice. \n\nThen after few months of conceiving I was transferred for further pregnancy treatment to Dr. Gayatri Roa. As mentioned earlier very professional and at the same time good care was taken through out my pregnancy. I had a great experience with Dr. Shweta and Dr. Gayatri throughout my treatment for and during pregnancy.\nI would definitely recommend Women's hospital for any pregnancy treatment or gynaecology treatment.

As for the care she provides, I truly appreciate her approach as well as her diagnosis. I have rarely seen any doctor so proactive. Even with such a hectic schedule, she always used to answer the silliest of my queries over WhatsApp. During my delivery, I felt I am with my family, not just doctors. Even the pain management of my Caesarean was so excellent that I never felt that I went through a surgery. I started my usual routine within seven days of my Caesarean. \n\nRegards,\nUmang Talreja\n\n\n\n \n \n\n ",

Being in a hospital is a daunting experience at any time, more so during a pandemic. The hospital took all the necessary precautions before I underwent a laparoscopic myomectomy a few months ago. Not once did I regret my decision to stay at the hospital alone post surgery. She took extra care and ensured the process went off seamlessly, which was incredibly reassuring for someone undergoing surgery for the first time. I had the smallest incisions and minimal discomfort during recovery. A special shout out to everyone at the hospital, right from the receptionists, to the assistant surgeons, the anaesthesiologists, the sisters and even the\u00a0finance team.They were\u00a0the most approachable, helpful and supportive and one can never have enough of that. The only downside is that I am running out of reasons to keep visiting :)",
