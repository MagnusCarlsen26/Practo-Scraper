"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Pregnancy,Pregnancy Hypertension (Preeclampsia/ Eclampsia),Pre and Post Delivery Care,Obstetrics / Antenatal Care,Caesarean Section (C Section),",0,0,YES,"Extremely proactive, very strong commitment and sense of responsibility, deeply empathetic, near 24/7 availability for patient, always flexible to accommodate the patient‚Äôs needs, very professional yet so humane, permanently cheerful, humorous and warm.

These are how I would try to summarise Dr Poonam Nautiyal in a few key words.

My wife and I had an earlier unsuccessful pregnancy primarily due to the negligence and lack of responsibility of our previous obstetrician. The event was extremely traumatic for both of us. So the second time, we were quite concerned about getting a good obstetrician, especially who can manage the deep set fear and trauma of my wife, and help us conclude the pregnancy successfully. 

We searched in Practo, and found Dr Poonam, amongst a few others. But we liked her profile since there were many good reviews about her. 

It‚Äôs been about 9 months since we have been interacting with Dr Poonam. During the course of time, she managed to create an environment of safety and trust for my wife, through consultations to the extent that my wife got deeply attached to her emotionally. In this time interval of 9 months there have been times where Dr Poonam was unavailable for physical consultation for a couple of weeks. But she provided us with a backup doctor to handle any emergencies. Even while she was travelling, Dr Poonam was still always available for telephonic consultations. Hats off to her dedication. Her concern for my wife seemed similar to her own daughter. 

We are now the happy parents of a newborn baby. The baby was born in Surya Hospitals via Cesarean (because of the previous mishap we didn‚Äôt want to take chances). Prior to the surgery, Dr Poonam had let us talk to one of her patients who had just delivered via Cesarean to check how easy or difficult it is to recover after a Cesarean, and associated first hand experiences.

Dr Poonam helped us with the hospitalisation. She also explained to us that we might need an attendant for the mother and baby post operation and gave us references for attendants. She was extremely supportive for all our requests. She got her own team to perform the operation. It was done at the exact time of our choice, the surgery went perfectly well. She even invited me to be there physically in the operating theatre so that I could provide emotional support to my wife during the surgery. I have found Dr Poonam extremely thoughtful and sensitive in these matters - she comprehends these innate needs of a to-be-parent couple so easily. Her emotional intelligence must be extremely high. 

The operation has gone very well. My wife recovered extremely fast from the operation and was mobile within a couple of days (we thought it would be weeks). 

In a world where there are so many reckless doctors (like the one we had the misfortune to consult for our first baby), it is doctors like Dr Poonam who bring back our faith for the medical profession. 

I am humbly thankful, grateful, and fortunate, as a husband and a parent, to have been blessed with an angel like Dr Poonam. 

For any expectant mother / father, I will highly recommend Dr Poonam - you will be in very safe hands, and I am talking from the perspective of a first hand wonderful experience.",2023-07-23 14:17:39,False,True,Haryy G,,,

Though the journey till this point hasn't been super smooth. We first met Doc in Apr'19 when me and my husband wanted to start trying to build our family. We met her for prenatal education and by Aug'19, we had conceived. But during our 12th week NT scan, we were told that the baby had Acrania/Anencephaly. The skull wasn't fully developed and would never be. It is a condition that isn't compatible with life. We were told to opt for MTP or Medically Terminated Pregnancy and the very next went to Criticare Andheri for the procedure. Though it's a small surgical procedure, usually conducted at OPD, Doc ensured we got the OT so that nothing was amiss. She even suggested we send the fetus for genetic testing, just to be sure it won't be a recurrent issue. We were heartbroken, as any to-be would be, but Doc stood by us super strong and kept giving me the assurance that things will look up. After a month, we conceived again, and this time Doc was super protective of us. Increased number of scans, lesser travel (lockdown helped in that one as well), energy rich diet, walking and exercising. And everytime we spoke to her, she became less of a Doc and more of a friend. I remember when I was detected with short cervix at 26 weeks and suggested bedrest along with steroid shots for fetus' lung development, Doc actually came to my house and gave me the shot just so I don't have to travel till the clinic for it. Such small gestures leaves such deep impact! After my c-sec, I recovered so so well within 2 days, could carry my bub and walk in the hospital corridor. She taught me how to latch, while my other new mum friends struggled with it. And surprisingly, my son refuses to go to anyone other than us and Doc.
