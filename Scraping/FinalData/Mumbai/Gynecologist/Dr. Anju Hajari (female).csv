"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Anju Hazari is absolutely outstanding gynecologist! 
We started consulting her in April, 2020 during my seventh month pregnancy and delivered our baby via C section on July 9, 2020. Due to Covid, she suggested we do video consulting as much as possible to avoid risk. However, for physical examination she called us to a clinic which was near my house. She never made us wait for any appointments and she is very punctual. She guided us step by step throughout my pregnancy and post delivery as well. She heard our concerns very patiently. She made us undergo countless BP checks, Sugar checks and blood test ( towards the end we were tierd :) ) but today we realise how important these tests were in order to have a healthy baby and we are very grateful for her guidance. Doctor Anju is detail oriented and extremely meticulous in recording every issue or concern raised by me during pregnancy and post pregnancy. After delivery she has constantly followed up on my health and baby's health. I completely trust her judgement.
To sum up, in my experience she is an excellent doctor because she is always available, polite,extremely patient, accurate guidance, constant follow ups on WA and phone, ",2020-09-04 09:39:44,False,True,Shefali Baviskar,Thank you Shefali for such an elaborate feedback,2020-09-04T13:58:49+0000,Dr. Anju Hajari
"Treatment satisfaction,","Pregnancy Check Up,",0,0,YES,"After reading positive reviews, we chose Dr Anju Hazari as our primary gynaecologist for pregnancy care and delivery of our first baby. She helped us throughout our pregnancy journey by providing able guidance. She is very meticulous in her work and made sure I underwent timely tests/scans to rule out any complications and alter course of medications wherever needed. During the delivery which was a C-section, she was a calming influence and helped ease my anxiety. She even helped with post operative care i.e support with lactation and exercises to help get back in shape. Really want to thank doctor for making my pregnancy journey healthy, safe and overall positive experience.

She gives a patient hearing to your problems. She first understands and comprehends your issue with complete detailing and then suggests the medical course of action.
