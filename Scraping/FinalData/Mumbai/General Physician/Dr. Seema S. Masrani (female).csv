,,0,0,NO,"Firstly I booked an appointment for 9PM. Spoke to the doctor only at 9:45 because she was busy with in-clinic patients which is understandable. But by then I was already not feeling well. 
Doctor explained the diagnosis and the treatment well but whether it was technical glitch or a simple oversee, I did not receive the prescription. I waited till 10:30, followed up on chat, but nothing. Finally after frantically calling Practo, I was connected with another doctor who gave me a diagnosis and prescription by 11:45 PM. 
After taking her meds, I finally felt relief at 1AM. 
So from 9PM - 11:45PM, I was just on the app, trying to get some meds for relief on a Saturday night knowing that on Sunday there will be no doctor available. 
The doctor finally sent the prescription on Sunday which was of no use to me. Itâ€™s important to ensure that in app patients are also given due service",2021-11-21 06:51:21,True,False,Verified Patient,Extremely sorry...was not aware that you did not receive prescription...would have appreciated if you would have called again....This app is internet based... techniqual challenges are know..I was just a phone call away...,2021-11-22T11:43:07+0000,Dr. Seema S.
