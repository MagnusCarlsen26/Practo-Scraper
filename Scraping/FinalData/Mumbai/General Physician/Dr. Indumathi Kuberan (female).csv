* Your Time - She gives ample time for consulting¬†and understands the history of patient
* Your Pocket - She understands¬†the value and would recommend generic medications with a similar composition.
* Your Diet - Instead of restricting, she suggests the proper proportions and benefits of everything.
* Your Results - Based on your periodic results, she would revise and gradually reduce your medications.
