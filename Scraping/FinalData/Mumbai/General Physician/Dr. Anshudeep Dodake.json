Since then I started having an intermittent runny nose and severe irritation in the throat following that i increased steam inhalation even further. Doctor asked me to bring a steamer along on the follow-up visit, he dismantled it and showed me burnt and singed plastic on the heating element, he further said this could be the cause of my nose and throat problem, upon stopping the use all my symptoms resolved promptly, I was speechless. Now me and my wife  take the trouble of traveling for 2 hours just to visit him for my BP and diabetes treatment and Rheumatoid arthritis of my wife, But its worth the hassle.  ",

Doctor asked me to bring a steamer along on the follow-up visit, he dismantled it and showed me burnt and singed plastic on the heating element, he further said this could be the cause of my nose and throat problem, upon stopping the use all my symptoms resolved promptly, I was speechless. Now me and my wife  take the trouble of traveling for 2 hours just to visit him for my BP and diabetes treatment and Rheumatoid arthritis of my wife, But its worth the hassle.  ",
