He emphasised on the importance of diet and liquid intake which helped my sister ultimately recover from her sickness. I also visited Dr. Jeevan Jain (Dr. Akshay\u2019s father) for this purpose and I\u2019m extremely happy with both the doctors especially with their friendly attitude towards their patients.",

On visiting, he explained the symptoms and the disease in detail which greatly eased my discomfort. He explained the cause and even the medication in great detail and was very helpful with any questions I had. He has been very friendly and welcoming as well as patient with me. He was also available after hours when I had an emergency, which was truly a blessing. He is caring towards his patients and has a remarkable personal touch. It already feels like I have been his patient for years and not merely days. Thank you Dr Akshay Jain for such a wonderful treatment. God Bless.",

He explained the cause and even the medication in great detail and was very helpful with any questions I had. He has been very friendly and welcoming as well as patient with me. He was also available after hours when I had an emergency, which was truly a blessing. He is caring towards his patients and has a remarkable personal touch.
