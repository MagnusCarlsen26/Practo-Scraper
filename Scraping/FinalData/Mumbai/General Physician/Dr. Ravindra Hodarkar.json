His answers were:\n1. It might be because I may be diabetic which I confirmed to him that based on my comprehensive medical reports done 3 months ago I am not diabetic.\n2. I might be having a high tolerance towards pain.\nThis answer I could not accept from a senior Doctor who has specialized in the field for which I had visited him.\nI was referred to a particular pathological laboratory for a laundry list of tests and X-ray. I was surprised to hear just the cost of X-ray of Rs 4500/- and that too it needs a precursor test that costs around Rs 180/-\n\nThank you to all those who had spent their time reading my feedback and I will appreciate those in advance who can make a small change here that benefits humanity.",

I might be having a high tolerance towards pain.\nThis answer I could not accept from a senior Doctor who has specialized in the field for which I had visited him.\nI was referred to a particular pathological laboratory for a laundry list of tests and X-ray.
