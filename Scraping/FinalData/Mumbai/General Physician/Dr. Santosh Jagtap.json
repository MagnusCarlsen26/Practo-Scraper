I said the doctor it was not a big issue to do all the tests when I already have the report which I did two months back with the same report I showed to another doctor. Doctor he couldn\u2019t find my problem, he said some different problems. Doctor behaves well and he is also good. Hospital is also good. Hospital nurses are also good.

I said the doctor it was not a big issue to do all the tests when I already have the report which I did two months back with the same report I showed to another doctor. Doctor he couldn\u2019t find my problem, he said some different problems. Doctor behaves well and he is also good. Hospital is also good. Hospital nurses are also good. From his side was was doing well only I didn't want to do all the test so I didnt visit him again. ",
