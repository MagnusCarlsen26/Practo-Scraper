But by then I was already not feeling well. \nDoctor explained the diagnosis and the treatment well but whether it was technical glitch or a simple oversee, I did not receive the prescription. I waited till 10:30, followed up on chat, but nothing. Finally after frantically calling Practo, I was connected with another doctor who gave me a diagnosis and prescription by 11:45 PM. \nAfter taking her meds, I finally felt relief at 1AM. \nSo from 9PM - 11:45PM, I was just on the app, trying to get some meds for relief on a Saturday night knowing that on Sunday there will be no doctor available. \nThe doctor finally sent the prescription on Sunday which was of no use to me. It\u2019s important to ensure that in app patients are also given due service",
