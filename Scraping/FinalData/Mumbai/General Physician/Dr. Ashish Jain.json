In my very first phone call to him, he was able to identify my case as one of likely Dengue, even before any testing was done. He was proved correct. Then, on an ongoing basis, he ensured proper handling of my hydration, platelet and other parameters. He explained the linkage of Hemoglobin and hydration and other nuances to me. All in all, he handled my case very admirably and I am very happy to recommend him as a General Physician.",
