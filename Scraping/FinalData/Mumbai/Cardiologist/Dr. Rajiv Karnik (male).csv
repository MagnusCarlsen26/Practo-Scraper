"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,","Hypertension Treatment,",0,0,YES,"First time I met him. Though it was late night,Dr was relaxed and cool. There was no sign of exhaustion. He checked all the reports I carried and scrutinized them. Advised some tests and changes in BP tablets which is being taken since long.

Looking forward to show reports  of tests done.
My best wishes to him. ",2021-07-29 07:50:16,False,True,Snehalata PAlkar,,,
