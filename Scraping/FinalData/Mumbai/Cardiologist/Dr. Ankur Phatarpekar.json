                "review_text": "I am a senior physiotherapist who has practiced for 43 years in several hospitals across South Mumbai. In this review I would like to summarize my excellent experience with cardiologist, Dr. Ankur Phatarphekar. I have had two consultations with him at his clinic for preoperative consultation on 2D-Echo and ECG tests. The first one was before my laser ablation procedure earlier this year, and for the second time, more recently, prior to my upcoming carpal tunnel surgery.\n \nWe often hear about fears of patients undergoing cardiac procedures like angioplasty and angiography. I too was apprehensive about my tests, and worried about a dire outcome. Throughout the assessment, the doctor assured me and explained in detail on what to expect. My assessment was thorough and I have been declared fit for surgery next week! Assuring the patient and explaining regarding the conditions, without exaggerating the problems is a critical part of patient care. Dr. Ankur was meticulous in his assessment, with attention to detail and clarity of assessment/ explanation.\n \nIn spite of having a heavy load of patients, Dr. Ankur was able to give adequate attention to patients, without the quality of treatment being compromised. He is a humble doctor and possesses a calm temperament. My years of experience as a physiotherapist is able to give me a unique perspective in patient care, and I was thoroughly satisfied as a patient at Dr. Ankur\u2019s cardiology clinic. In Mumbai, we surely need cardiologists like Dr. Ankur who keep our hearts healthy and excel in patient care thus leaving a patient feeling assured.\n \nTo summarize, I give Dr. Ankur P. an \u201cExcellent\u201d in patient care, detailed assessment, perfect diagnosis, correct advice, and a great attitude. I express my gratitude and thankfulness for his time. I wish him all the best in his flourishing career!\n \n\u2013 Review by Dr. Mrs. Meera Chiplunkar",

My grandfather had three blockages in his heart, and two of them were over 90%, with the other at 80%. He also suffered from kidney failure and was a dialysis patient, which added to the complexity of the situation.Dr. Ankur Phatarpekar was able to manage my grandfather's complicated medical condition and perform a successful angioplasty. He utilized advanced tools that allowed him to use the same thickness of dye for angioplasty as used in angiography. This was remarkable, as it minimized the risk of complications during the procedure while effectively treating my grandfather's condition.Dr. Ankur also took the time to communicate with us clearly and explain the complications of my grandfather beforehand. But it was reassuring to know that he was doing everything he could to ensure that the procedure went smoothly and that my grandfather was comfortable throughout.Overall, I would highly recommend Dr. Ankur to anyone seeking exceptional care and expertise in handling complex cases. He is a exceptional doctor who takes pride in his work, and my family and I are extremely grateful for his help. Thank you, Dr. Ankur Phatarpekar!",

My dad is fit and fine now.\nThanks from Mandelia family",

In this review I would like to summarize my excellent experience with cardiologist, Dr. Ankur Phatarphekar. I have had two consultations with him at his clinic for preoperative consultation on 2D-Echo and ECG tests. The first one was before my laser ablation procedure earlier this year, and for the second time, more recently, prior to my upcoming carpal tunnel surgery.\n \nWe often hear about fears of patients undergoing cardiac procedures like angioplasty and angiography. I too was apprehensive about my tests, and worried about a dire outcome. Throughout the assessment, the doctor assured me and explained in detail on what to expect. My assessment was thorough and I have been declared fit for surgery next week! Assuring the patient and explaining regarding the conditions, without exaggerating the problems is a critical part of patient care. Dr. Ankur was meticulous in his assessment, with attention to detail and clarity of assessment/ explanation.\n \nIn spite of having a heavy load of patients, Dr. Ankur was able to give adequate attention to patients, without the quality of treatment being compromised. He is a humble doctor and possesses a calm temperament. My years of experience as a physiotherapist is able to give me a unique perspective in patient care, and I was thoroughly satisfied as a patient at Dr. Ankur\u2019s cardiology clinic. In Mumbai, we surely need cardiologists like Dr. Ankur who keep our hearts healthy and excel in patient care thus leaving a patient feeling assured.\n \nTo summarize, I give Dr. Ankur P. an \u201cExcellent\u201d in patient care, detailed assessment, perfect diagnosis, correct advice, and a great attitude. I express my gratitude and thankfulness for his time. I wish him all the best in his flourishing career!\n \n\u2013 Review by Dr. Mrs. Meera Chiplunkar",

My grandfather had three blockages in his heart, and two of them were over 90%, with the other at 80%. He also suffered from kidney failure and was a dialysis patient, which added to the complexity of the situation.Dr. Ankur Phatarpekar was able to manage my grandfather's complicated medical condition and perform a successful angioplasty. He utilized advanced tools that allowed him to use the same thickness of dye for angioplasty as used in angiography. This was remarkable, as it minimized the risk of complications during the procedure while effectively treating my grandfather's condition.Dr. Ankur also took the time to communicate with us clearly and explain the complications of my grandfather beforehand. But it was reassuring to know that he was doing everything he could to ensure that the procedure went smoothly and that my grandfather was comfortable throughout.Overall, I would highly recommend Dr. Ankur to anyone seeking exceptional care and expertise in handling complex cases. He is a exceptional doctor who takes pride in his work, and my family and I are extremely grateful for his help. Thank you, Dr. Ankur Phatarpekar!",

                "review_text": "My dad was having trouble with chest pain while walking and climbing stairs. Family physician recommended Dr. Ankur Phatarpekar. \nMy dad consulted Dr. Ankur P. and he told him that he is symptomatic for an angioplasty and needs an urgent angiograph.\nMy first interaction with Dr. Ankur P. was directly in the operation theatre where my dad's angiograph showed 100% block.\nI appreciate Dr. Ankur's professionalism to explain us options and guide us with correct medical advice.\nMy great thanks to Dr. Ankur P. is based on the fact that my dad has a history of blood pressure and Dr. Ankur P. revived him to give him a new life.\nAs my dad was in critical condition, Dr. Ankur P. helped us with his team to be in the Hospital till his parameters were stable which was close to 20 hours of personal supervision. \nBecause of this personal care and sharing of facts during those 20 hours, I would recommend Dr. Ankur Phatarpekar. \nEven though I have no medical background, but, out of curiosity we checked the academics of Dr. Ankur P. **** *** ***** \nMy dad had multiple blockages and Dr. Ankur P. only used a stent for opening the 100% blockage and recommended a diet and exercises for the other blockages. My dad is fit and fine now.\nThanks from Mandelia family",
