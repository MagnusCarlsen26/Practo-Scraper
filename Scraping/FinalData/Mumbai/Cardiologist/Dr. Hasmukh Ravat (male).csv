,,0,0,Yes,My dad had consulted the doctor and it was for general follow up visit. ********* *** **** ** ******* I would like to recommend the doctor to other people. There was no waiting time in the hospital when we went. ,2021-06-09 04:11:55,False,True,Pamela Tauro,,,
,,0,0,NO,"My parents visited him through a formal ECHS (Army medical scheme) referral. 
As soon as he came to know that they were visiting him under the ECHS scheme, he was rude and indifferent to them - he pushed their papers to his assistant and didn’t even talk to them.
