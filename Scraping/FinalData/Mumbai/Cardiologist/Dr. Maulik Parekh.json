                "review_text": "Dr. Maulik Parekh performed a highly advanced cardiac valve procedure TAVR on my father to treat his Aortic Valve in Sir H N Reliance Hospital. \nAfter initially finding out my father has Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis I was referred to a cardiac surgeon who advised us to do the conventional open heart surgery for valve replacement. \n\nMe and my Family's huge fear was the Trauma of Open Heart Surgery, it's complications and more over the painful recovery process and long time for him to be back to normal. I was determined that at age 74 I don't want my father to go thru this painful surgery. To add to it, my father has a rare blood group (B negative) and he already has two stents in his heart from previously done Angioplasty and more importantly a traumatic and painful kidney surgery done in past which was always back of his and our mind.\n\nAfter an extensive research to find an alternative procedure for valve replacement I learnt about TAVR. That\u2019s when I started looking for doctors who perform TAVR procedure in India and if possible in Mumbai. I came across a very humble profile of Dr. Maulik Parekh with not much social media hype, but I studied his profile and saw his extensive experience in TAVI / TAVR and decided to consult him. \n\nAfter consulting and meeting with Dr.Parekh in Sir HN Reliance Hospital, who came across as a very young, friendly but passionate doctor and very thorough about TAVR. He explained me, my father and my sister very patiently about every detail of the entire process of TAVR including the pros and cons. Despite my fear and worry, he walked me through each step with great patience and answered all my queries calmly until we felt satisfied.\u00a0 This consultation gave me and more importantly my father a lot of confidence and we were sure that he is the right doctor for my father's treatment and decided to go ahead with TAVR. \n\nThe procedure was done on 15th February and during the procedure Dr. Parekh and his entire team were very professional and caring, and they showed me and my father tremendous generosity of spirit. \n\nI watched Dr. Parekh's team interact and the way whole Reliance Hospital staff were comforting and kept me informed and assured as I stood outside the OT about each and every step during procedure. I will never forget how Dr. Maulik came out of the OT after completion of procedure, he had a big smile and was so happy and told me that the procedure went excellent and everything went without any concerns and procedure was perfect. He took me inside immediately and explained me the whole procedure on screen as it was done real-time. He asked me to meet my Father in recovery room and I was amazed that my father spoke to me and was sharing his lovely experience in the OT and how the staff of OT kept comforting him and interacted with him with comfort. \n\nThe recovery of my father post surgery was very fast and was discharged on the 3rd day of the procedure. He is recovering very fast and has already started doing his everyday chorus by his own.\n\nThe quality of my experience here makes me wish everyone should get such wonderful doctor and treatment in our healthcare system like I am glad I could give my father. \n\nAll thanks to Dr. Maulik Parekh.\ud83d\ude4f\n",
