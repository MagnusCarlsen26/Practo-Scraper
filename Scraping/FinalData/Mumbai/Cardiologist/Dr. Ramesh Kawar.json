Doctor prescribed medicines which suited to my body and very helpful because I took some medicines from outside which were not suitable for my body. I visited for a BP check up because after my pregnancy blood pressure was not controlled and I took outside medicines which were not suitable for my body. There was a long waiting time and the staff were not supportive and they did not give importance to appointment booked patients and there was no queue for patients other than that doctor was very good and I would like to recommend this doctor and they have improve staff and appointment system.",
