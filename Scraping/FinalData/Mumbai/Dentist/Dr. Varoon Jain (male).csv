He aslo assured me that it was a regular procedure and assured me of a painless treatment as well..

I was completely satisfied and decided to go ahead with the procedure..
Few regulatory blood tests before the implant and got an appointment for the very next day...

The dental implant went pitch perfect and I hardly had any pain during or after the procedure..

Today is my third day after the implant and I am very happy as I have no pain, I can eat normally and now just waiting to get the healing so I can have a cap soon...

Kudos to Dr. Varoon and smile sutra team..
You guys rock..
