Because of my fear I have visited a dentist for the second time until the age of 32 and my last visit was over a decade back. Cause of negligence in visiting a good dentist I had multiple issues before I visited Dr Raunak. \n\nIn my first 1-2 sittings I was very scared cause I knew I needed a root canal , a tooth extraction and few fillings. The best part of the whole thing is it\u2019s been like overall 4 sittings so far and I am kind of through with fixing most of my dental issues. \n\nRight in the consultation sitting Dr Raunak explained to me what were the issues with my respective teeth. He not only explained me what procedures were required but he actually kept me updated on real time basis while he was performing the procedures so as to what exactly was he doing.  \n\nI always regarded dental implants to be the most scariest thing because it\u2019s like extracting a tooth first drilling inside the bone and fixing a screw.  Had it not been the encouragement and confidence from Dr Raunak I doubt I would have ever done an implant in my life . \n\nBe it my root canal, implant, extraction, fillings, cleaning all went extremely smooth.\n\nDr Raunak and Dr Surena manage things skilfully they perfectly know how to educate their clients they ensure client satisfaction is given upmost priority.  The staff working at their clinic are very cordial and caring. \n\nThanks a million Doctor Raunak and Doctor Surena.. I am struggling with words to express my gratitude..! ",

Living abroad and visiting dentists there, I was always apprehensive and coming to Innovar dental changed my perception completely. The process was prompt and procedure painless, done with utmost care and professionalism. Thank you doc for putting my fear of dentist\u2019s chair to rest. Cannot recommend you enough. Grateful for your time, patience and expertise. Cheers. ",

Dr. Raunak tells it how it is and told me that a procedure is not needed. Guess what? He was right. He favors patient care over dollars. He truly cares about all his patients. A diamond in the rough.

Because of my fear I have visited a dentist for the second time until the age of 32 and my last visit was over a decade back. Cause of negligence in visiting a good dentist I had multiple issues before I visited Dr Raunak. \n\nIn my first 1-2 sittings I was very scared cause I knew I needed a root canal , a tooth extraction and few fillings. The best part of the whole thing is it\u2019s been like overall 4 sittings so far and I am kind of through with fixing most of my dental issues. \n\nRight in the consultation sitting Dr Raunak explained to me what were the issues with my respective teeth. He not only explained me what procedures were required but he actually kept me updated on real time basis while he was performing the procedures so as to what exactly was he doing.  \n\nI always regarded dental implants to be the most scariest thing because it\u2019s like extracting a tooth first drilling inside the bone and fixing a screw.  Had it not been the encouragement and confidence from Dr Raunak I doubt I would have ever done an implant in my life . \n\nBe it my root canal, implant, extraction, fillings, cleaning all went extremely smooth.\n\nDr Raunak and Dr Surena manage things skilfully they perfectly know how to educate their clients they ensure client satisfaction is given upmost priority.  The staff working at their clinic are very cordial and caring. \n\nThanks a million Doctor Raunak and Doctor Surena.. I am struggling with words to express my gratitude..! ",

Living abroad and visiting dentists there, I was always apprehensive and coming to Innovar dental changed my perception completely. The process was prompt and procedure painless, done with utmost care and professionalism. Thank you doc for putting my fear of dentist\u2019s chair to rest. Cannot recommend you enough.

At first i was very sceptical about going to him as i have always been to my old doctor but when i went to him he put me at ease. He explained the entire procedure to me which was not done by the previous doctor. Got a root canalling done and denture fixing must say did not feel even the slightest pain during the procedure. Was extremely happy with everything. Have also recommended him to my other friends and colleagues. God bless him. He is truly an amazing dentist. Please do visit him without any hesitation. Will give him a 10 on 10. Thank you Dr. Raunak.",

The fact that makes them so good is their way of involving and explaining the patient what is wrong and what needs to be done! Not only them but their staff is also friendly and it makes them very approachable.\nAnd checking on patients after their procedures is something which I found really sweet. \n\nI 100% recommend Dr.Ranauk's services! You won't be disappointed :)",
