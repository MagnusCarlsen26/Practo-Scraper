The process of filling and cosmetically re-shaping filling was done in such a way that no one can make out that anything was ever wrong with that area. \n\nCavity removal and filling on two back teeth was painless and done within an hour in one single sitting.\n\nRoot canal was a difficult one, it took 3+ hours, and my case had a high risk of nerve damage, he explained the entire thing before hand along with where and how I would feel pain,  the procedure was mostly painless, with the unavoidable exception of  a few of the times that the nerve was pinched as the tooth was slowly taken out.

We mutually agreed to at least try and save it thinking it might work with your consent of course and explained you the possible pros and cons clearly.\nWhat does informed consent mean?\nUnfortunately your pain didn\u2019t subside as we had expected. So as discussed at the consultation appointment the other option was the only thing left to be implemented i.e extracting the tooth.\nAnd this is what informed consent means.\nBut this option didn\u2019t go down your throat when the time arrived for it. You shouldn\u2019t have agreed upon for it at the first appointment itself and denied any sort of treatment at our clinic if you were not ready to get the tooth removed if the first option doesn\u2019t work.\nYou being a smart clever and well educated girl such a puerile behaviour was not expected at all especially after discussing each and every detail before hand.\nAs far as medications are concerned the doctor had cleared his stand on that day itself that until and and unless the source of infection (i.e the broken instrument) is either removed or bypassed completely or disinfected effectively the infection will recur again and again periodically ultimately transforming into a big abscess which might hurt you even more may be not today but surely some day later. This is what more than 13 years of experience of our expert doctor concludes.\nInstead of thanking the doctor that he tried to save your tooth that too without even charging his fees for it, you are inappropriately recommending others not to go to him? He himself even personally messaged you the following day when the procedure was performed to know about your wellbeing. But you and your father didn\u2019t even show any respect for the doctor. That proves your immaturity and arrogance anyhow.\nWe are practising in this city since 13 years and encounter a lot of good calibre and high profile cases daily so performing treatments without prior consent is not at all our preference no matter whatever the situation would be. We never ever compromise on the standards and quality for that matter and we even charge for it extra if needed. \nWe have tons of patients walking in and out but None of them have ever complained such a thing in past except you in these years.\n\n\nHaving said that we still hope the best for you in future and pray to Almighty for your complete recovery soon \ud83d\ude0a \nMay you stay blessed happy and healthy always..!!",

I went to him because i had severe toothache due to an unfinished root canal done by my previous dentist. I was given 2 options of either extracting the tooth or attempting a re-root canal by the dr after looking at an x-ray that he took on the spot. I asked him what he recommended and he said that he would want me to give him a chance to save the tooth and so i did and we started the procedure immediately. I was prescribed anti inflammatorys and a painkiller ******* *** to be taken 3 times a day for 5 days. These 5 days were the most painful days of my life. After this when i went back to him i had a huge hard and painful swelling on my jaw which showed that i did have infection and that I should have been prescribed antibiotics for the same. ******* ** ******** *** ********** i was recommended to do an extraction and place an implant as soon as we extract the tooth to save time. Since I didn\u2019t want to lose my tooth i called up my family dr right after getting out of that clinic and told him the entire scenario* * *** **** **** **** ** ***** **** *** ********** **** ************* *** ****** *** **** ** ** **** ********* ****** *** ****** *********** *** * **** *** **** ** * ****** **** ** ************ It took me 3 days to recover from the pain but i still have a huge swelling filled with puss and infection. This was my experience with Dr. Aashiq and i feel the readers are smart enough to know what is best for them.",

The process of filling and cosmetically re-shaping filling was done in such a way that no one can make out that anything was ever wrong with that area. \n\nCavity removal and filling on two back teeth was painless and done within an hour in one single sitting.\n\nRoot canal was a difficult one, it took 3+ hours, and my case had a high risk of nerve damage, he explained the entire thing before hand along with where and how I would feel pain,  the procedure was mostly painless, with the unavoidable exception of  a few of the times that the nerve was pinched as the tooth was slowly taken out.

                "reply_text": "Thanks a lot for blaming us and negatively recommending us for wrong things done by your previous dentist.\nYour previous doctor had broken an root canal cleaning instrument right at the apex of your tooth root while doing root canal procedure which definitely will cause you pain whether we prescribe antibiotics or not. \nWe clarified this right at the time of consultation itself and gave you two options whether to extract or to give it a chance and save it. We mutually agreed to at least try and save it thinking it might work with your consent of course and explained you the possible pros and cons clearly.\nWhat does informed consent mean?\nUnfortunately your pain didn\u2019t subside as we had expected. So as discussed at the consultation appointment the other option was the only thing left to be implemented i.e extracting the tooth.\nAnd this is what informed consent means.\nBut this option didn\u2019t go down your throat when the time arrived for it. You shouldn\u2019t have agreed upon for it at the first appointment itself and denied any sort of treatment at our clinic if you were not ready to get the tooth removed if the first option doesn\u2019t work.\nYou being a smart clever and well educated girl such a puerile behaviour was not expected at all especially after discussing each and every detail before hand.\nAs far as medications are concerned the doctor had cleared his stand on that day itself that until and and unless the source of infection (i.e the broken instrument) is either removed or bypassed completely or disinfected effectively the infection will recur again and again periodically ultimately transforming into a big abscess which might hurt you even more may be not today but surely some day later. This is what more than 13 years of experience of our expert doctor concludes.\nInstead of thanking the doctor that he tried to save your tooth that too without even charging his fees for it, you are inappropriately recommending others not to go to him? He himself even personally messaged you the following day when the procedure was performed to know about your wellbeing. But you and your father didn\u2019t even show any respect for the doctor. That proves your immaturity and arrogance anyhow.\nWe are practising in this city since 13 years and encounter a lot of good calibre and high profile cases daily so performing treatments without prior consent is not at all our preference no matter whatever the situation would be. We never ever compromise on the standards and quality for that matter and we even charge for it extra if needed. \nWe have tons of patients walking in and out but None of them have ever complained such a thing in past except you in these years.\n\n\nHaving said that we still hope the best for you in future and pray to Almighty for your complete recovery soon \ud83d\ude0a \nMay you stay blessed happy and healthy always..!!",

I went to him because i had severe toothache due to an unfinished root canal done by my previous dentist. I was given 2 options of either extracting the tooth or attempting a re-root canal by the dr after looking at an x-ray that he took on the spot. I asked him what he recommended and he said that he would want me to give him a chance to save the tooth and so i did and we started the procedure immediately. I was prescribed anti inflammatorys and a painkiller ******* *** to be taken 3 times a day for 5 days. These 5 days were the most painful days of my life. After this when i went back to him i had a huge hard and painful swelling on my jaw which showed that i did have infection and that I should have been prescribed antibiotics for the same. ******* ** ******** *** ********** i was recommended to do an extraction and place an implant as soon as we extract the tooth to save time. Since I didn\u2019t want to lose my tooth i called up my family dr right after getting out of that clinic and told him the entire scenario* * *** **** **** **** ** ***** **** *** ********** **** ************* *** ****** *** **** ** ** **** ********* ****** *** ****** *********** *** * **** *** **** ** * ****** **** ** ************ It took me 3 days to recover from the pain but i still have a huge swelling filled with puss and infection.

But Dr. Shaikh makes it clear that his patients understand everything well before the treatment is started with clarity and utter transparency on the budget as well as the stipulated time frame for the required treatment. I'm feeling fortunate enough to have found an excellent professional but more importantly a friend who would guide you through the process. I'd give Dr. Shaikh 5 stars for his amazing work.",

He even suggested me to place a mini crown after RCT which I would be doing Very soon\n\nA big Thank you to Dr. Shaikh and Practo for helping needful patients to find their specific doctors at the tip of the fingers..!!!",

We are very happy with the treatment we got and we recommend him strongly.\n\nSecondly i would like to praise the staff as well as they were very kind and helpful throughout. I have found that in other clinics the staff is not that much concerned nor caring and not even soft-spoken.\nAnd lastly the clinic environment is also calm and soothing to everyone. Very nicely designed.\n\nOverall very nice experience and excellent treatment.\nKeep up the good work.!!\n",

I got 3 treatments done from .\n1) onlay \n2) surgical tooth extraction and \n3 ) wisdom tooth extraction. \nHe makes sure that the patient understands the complete procedure and explains it in simple words . \n Initially I wanted to opt for crown instead of onlay but he made me understand what a world of a difference the onlay would make . \nI was also scared about the surgical extraction which was done smoothly as well . \nAll my worries were thrown out of the window .\nWould surely recommend Doc sheikh . \n\n",

He made my mom very comfortable(as my mom was very apprehensive), had a thorough examination of the entire oral cavity, and explained the possible treatment (root canal followed by placement of cap) and fabrication of a bridge for one of the missing tooth, very nicely and with a reasonable expense for the same.\n \nThe best part was, we had only 3 visits and we're done with the entire treatment. The procedure done by the Dr was ethically done and with due care, the Dr was very polite and humble and gentle in his approach towards the patient which I would highly appreciate.\n\nAll in all it was a very good experience and I felt satisfied for the for the money I'd to spend on the treatment.\n\nI would highly recommend Dr Aashiq Shaikh for any dental treatment if anyone is looking for in and around Navi Mumbai.\n\nWarm Regards,\nSatisfied patient.",

An Dental XRay was suggested before next follow up visit which on subsequent follow up visit ruled out any major issue.The clarity of Dr Shaikh was amazing and I found him very approachable and patient centric in his approach.

He insisted on maintaining the naturalness of my original teeth as much as i can while getting an ideal smile line that best suited my face. These laminates are really fantastic, I never thought of getting such nice and original looking teeth with any artificial material. Dr. Shaikh educated me thoroughly about this concept and he even asked me to search on the Internet about emax veneers.now my perception for dentistry has changed altogether. A 100% recommendation for Dr. Shaikh from my behalf without any second thought. ",

One of the options was to restore my badly broken tooth with an emax  veneer instead of a crown which required unnecessary grinding of the tooth. i liked this option very much and he actually restored my tooth with no or minimum grinding .he and his assistant all were helpful and kind throughout the procedure. i felt comfortable and relaxed and now my fear for dental treatment is totally gone.thanks to the super expert doctor in our town.now i would not recommend any one to unnecessary grind their whole tooth just to place a crown instead emax veneer would be a better option...!cheers to him and his assistant... god bless them..!",

I hardly felt any sort of pain not even discomfort for that matter. He had placed a rubber sheet which prevented water and the chemicals used for root canal treatment getting into my mouth and made my experience totally comfortable. I had never seen any other doctor using this rubber sheet anywhere else.\nVery dedicated and passionate doctor who really cares for his patients.\nAnd to top that up he has a very overwhelming and welcoming staff who guided me before and after the procedure as to what care should be taken after the procedure.\nAll together I recommend him strongly and wish him very good luck in future.\n:-) ",

I had never thought that visiting a dentist would be so much relaxing and comfortable. The doctor was kind enough to take time and listen to my problem calmly.\nHe explained to me in detail about the problem that occured in my tooth which was paining horribly, and he provided a permanent solution for it. He performed root canal treatment without any pain. And moreover i liked his concept of not grinding the tooth just to place a cap or a crown instead placing emax onlays was a way much more better option. And i am happy and feeling much relieved after the treatment now. He restored my tooth back almost like nothing had happened to it ever. The ugly decayed tooth is now looking as good as natural tooth. \nDr. Aashiq is really a COSMETIC DENTIST and looks at doing treatment correctly and beautifully.\n\nMr. PERFECTIONIST i would say...!!!",
