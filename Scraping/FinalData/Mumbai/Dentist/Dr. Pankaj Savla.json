I didn't raise this to him as I had already agreed the rates after which I came to know about this, so would request the doctor to revisit the charges for the future treatment. \n\nHowever this does not undermine the fact that his treatment is very good and recommended to anyone with a dental problem",

I was with my friends at a dinner party, and my front tooth which was partially artificial came off while eating as I bit on a chicken bone very hard. It was so embarassing as I couldn't smile properly. It was 9pm at night, but I took a chance and I called Dr.Pankaj while he was attending his last patient for the day and was supposed to catch up with his family after that. But he agreed to treat me instead. I immediately left from my dinner party to him. He got it done in 20 mins and I was back for the dinner within an hour smiling broadly as if nothing happened. Really appreciate Dr.Pankaj's attitude towards his patients and I highly recommend him as your regular dentist. ",

I didn't raise this to him as I had already agreed the rates after which I came to know about this, so would request the doctor to revisit the charges for the future treatment. \n\nHowever this does not undermine the fact that his treatment is very good and recommended to anyone with a dental problem",

It was so embarassing as I couldn't smile properly. It was 9pm at night, but I took a chance and I called Dr.Pankaj while he was attending his last patient for the day and was supposed to catch up with his family after that. But he agreed to treat me instead. I immediately left from my dinner party to him. He got it done in 20 mins and I was back for the dinner within an hour smiling broadly as if nothing happened. Really appreciate Dr.Pankaj's attitude towards his patients and I highly recommend him as your regular dentist. ",
