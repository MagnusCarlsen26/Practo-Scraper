The entire team is really punctual and cares a lot about their patients. Even after my RCT treatment, the doctors took followups just to check with me if there is no pain and I\u2019m not facing any issues. Will 10/10 recommend Dr Shetty and team for a one stop solution for all dental needs.",

The surgery was conducted in her clinic by a visting Surgent  who was very professional too  he explained me each stage of the procedure while Dr Rashmi was present through the surgery . After the surgery Dr Rashmi checked on me by calling me and and also answered all my queries that I had during the recovery .\nEven her staff in her clinic are very friendly and polite .\nPeople say wisdom tooth extraction is so traumatic but for me it was such a smooth experience thanks to Dr Rashmi and her staff.

The surgery was conducted in her clinic by a visting Surgent  who was very professional too  he explained me each stage of the procedure while Dr Rashmi was present through the surgery . After the surgery Dr Rashmi checked on me by calling me and and also answered all my queries that I had during the recovery .\nEven her staff in her clinic are very friendly and polite .\nPeople say wisdom tooth extraction is so traumatic but for me it was such a smooth experience thanks to Dr Rashmi and her staff. Thank you once again .\n",

At the moment I trusted everything but after getting the filling done I had pain for a month. I visited again for the pain and they told me that it's for some other reason which they've now fixed. I still had a lot of pain so I got it checked by someone else *** ***** *** **** ** ***** *** ***** * **** ***** ******* *** ******* ** ******** *** ***** *** ***** *** **** ******* **** **** ** *** ******** ***\nI had no issues or pain when I first went to see them for braces.

The extraction and implant process went seamlessly and without any pain, demonstrating her remarkable expertise and unwavering commitment to my well-being. I was deeply impressed by Dr. Shetty's dedication to ensuring my comfort throughout the entire treatment, and her exceptional post-treatment care left me feeling secure and well-cared for during my recovery. Not only did Dr. Shetty provide a flawless implant result, but she also fully restored my trust in dental procedures. For anyone seeking exceptional dental care with a personal touch, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Rashmi Shetty.",
