So visited a dentist by visiting Practo and checking the online reviews for a nearby dentist . Thus landed on \\\" Roots Dental Clinic -  Dr Meenaz Thakaar \\\"  Thanks to Practo !!!\\n\\nI was being operated by \\\"Dr Urvi Ashar \\\" . ******** ********* *** **** **  *** ****** ** ***** ***** ******* I had a cavity which had entered the root area and thus I was advised for a root canal . It was a good experience with minimal pain or discomfort during the whole root canal  treatment . It took 3 to 4 sessions for the same followed by permanent filling . \\n\\nRoot canal was smoothly done by the doctor at Roots Dental Clinic. It was probably due to advancements in the technology  over the years and also precise expertise of the doctor who treated me.  I would recommend , to visit the clinic whenever you need to see a dentist for any tooth related problems . \\n\\nNow about the charges , I was being charged 5k for the Root Canal and 1.8 k for the final fillings . You can verify the market price of the treatment and decide for you if it's overpriced or optimum pricing .  Service here is good and doctor is friendly and explained me the minute details which a patient needs to know. \\n\\nMy advice to others would be - Root Canal nowadays is just like a Cakewalk and can be done with  ease and it won't be that  painful or complex as the term \\\"Root canal\\\" creates a painful picture in the back of your mind . Get it done immediately to arrest further decay of your tooth .\\n\\nOverall it was a great experience getting my Root Canal treatment at the \\\" Roots Dental Clinic Chembur by Dr Urvi Ashar  \\",

Dr. URVI's passion for her profession and her humane and personal caring demeanour is truly admirable. My best wishes for happiness and success in all her professional and personal endeavours.",

So visited a dentist by visiting Practo and checking the online reviews for a nearby dentist . Thus landed on \\\" Roots Dental Clinic -  Dr Meenaz Thakaar \\\"  Thanks to Practo !!!\\n\\nI was being operated by \\\"Dr Urvi Ashar \\\" . ******** ********* *** **** **  *** ****** ** ***** ***** ******* I had a cavity which had entered the root area and thus I was advised for a root canal . It was a good experience with minimal pain or discomfort during the whole root canal  treatment . It took 3 to 4 sessions for the same followed by permanent filling . \\n\\nRoot canal was smoothly done by the doctor at Roots Dental Clinic. It was probably due to advancements in the technology  over the years and also precise expertise of the doctor who treated me.  I would recommend , to visit the clinic whenever you need to see a dentist for any tooth related problems . \\n\\nNow about the charges , I was being charged 5k for the Root Canal and 1.8 k for the final fillings . You can verify the market price of the treatment and decide for you if it's overpriced or optimum pricing .  Service here is good and doctor is friendly and explained me the minute details which a patient needs to know. \\n\\nMy advice to others would be - Root Canal nowadays is just like a Cakewalk and can be done with  ease and it won't be that  painful or complex as the term \\\"Root canal\\\" creates a painful picture in the back of your mind . Get it done immediately to arrest further decay of your tooth .\\n\\nOverall it was a great experience getting my Root Canal treatment at the \\\" Roots Dental Clinic Chembur by Dr Urvi Ashar  \\",

My front tooth was in a bad condition and have always done composite filling with my childhood dentist but it always had a stain and lacked finish. \nI then decided to go to Dr Urvi and she completely transformed it. My front tooth  has never been in a better and healthier condition. I must thank Dr Urvi for a confident smile now. The follow up appointments have been great and more importantly the treatment is painfree.\nIt's a state of the art clinic and I would strongly recommend Dr Urvi to anyone who is looking for a healthier teeth coupled with a professional and a pain free treatment \n\nThank you\nRam\n",

She explained  what had  happened to my tooth n what possible options i was having  . While other dentist  told me to remove tooth,she gave option for RCT. My RCT was done in just one sitting and it was done with such a perfection that i didn't have to take even a crocin tablet . Then after one week i got permanent filling for that.

I appreciate her soft spokenness, patience in explaining the actual problem to the patient and allowing the patient to decide whether the treatment can be started immediately or not depending upon the intensity of the problem.\nCharges are also highly reasonable.

But treatment under Dr. Urvi Ashar is a totally different experience which cannot be explained. ",
