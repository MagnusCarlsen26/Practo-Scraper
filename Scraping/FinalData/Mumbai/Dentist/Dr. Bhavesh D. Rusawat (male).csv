"Value for money,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Doctor friendliness,","Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,NO,"I went as I chipped off a part of my tooth 
Instead of recommending a filling to short term heel the issue the doctor directly asked me to think for Long term by getting implants and the cost of which was 11000 per tooth 
He told me that I had to do for atleast 6 upper teeth 
Maybe this is needed long term but directly jumping on it made me feel that he was not ready to heal the issue for now 
There was no solution provided to cure immediately
