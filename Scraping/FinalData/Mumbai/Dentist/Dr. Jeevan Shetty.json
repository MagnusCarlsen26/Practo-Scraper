I had basically come to him for a recurring toothache and for second opinion on Bone Grafting suggested by my previous dentist. But preliminary investigation by Dr. Jeevan suggested that so such procedure was required. The root cause was identified and explained well by Dr. Jeevan and the necessary treatment for the same was done and I really had a sigh of relief.  \nI recently got another Root Canal treatment done from Dr. Jeevan last week.  Again this time, it was very professionally handled and even the minor issues I had was taken care of.  Let me tell you I had RCT done earlier, but none could beat the experience at \u201c32 Smile  Stones\u201d.  Needless to mention that being a working professional, I was able to get the appointments as per my convenience. \nA very peculiar aspect of Dr. Jeevan is that he is a perfectionist. He and his team will ensure that he you are comfortable and he himself is convinced about the same.  With all the latest equipment\u2019s and accessories in place, the ambience of his clinic, *** ********* and vast experience, be rest assured that you have ended up at the right place.  I would strongly recommend Dr. Jeevan for any dental issues you experience. \n",

I had basically come to him for a recurring toothache and for second opinion on Bone Grafting suggested by my previous dentist. But preliminary investigation by Dr. Jeevan suggested that so such procedure was required. The root cause was identified and explained well by Dr. Jeevan and the necessary treatment for the same was done and I really had a sigh of relief.  \nI recently got another Root Canal treatment done from Dr. Jeevan last week.  Again this time, it was very professionally handled and even the minor issues I had was taken care of.  Let me tell you I had RCT done earlier, but none could beat the experience at \u201c32 Smile  Stones\u201d.  Needless to mention that being a working professional, I was able to get the appointments as per my convenience. \nA very peculiar aspect of Dr. Jeevan is that he is a perfectionist. He and his team will ensure that he you are comfortable and he himself is convinced about the same.  With all the latest equipment\u2019s and accessories in place, the ambience of his clinic, *** ********* and vast experience, be rest assured that you have ended up at the right place.  I would strongly recommend Dr. Jeevan for any dental issues you experience. \n",

The tooth looked quite normal, like any other teeth but it was very painful.\nThe left side of my head started aching very badly, the left temple side's blood vessel veins pulsating could not only be felt but also seen, it was so painful. I have preserved the extracted tooth. The rot in the tooth could be seen only after extraction. The rot is the result of my carelessness.\nNot brushing my teeth before going to bed is the prise I had to pay.\nI thank Dr. Jeevan Shetty for extracting my rotten tooth without damage to any other teeth, gums, cheeck or tongue.\nAt night I enjoyed my ice cream, cold milkshake with bananas and a good night sleep.\nI am back to normal.",

His clinic is well equipped with all the relevant tools and accessories.  Without a doubt, I confidently recommend Dr. Shetty for being guardian of your \"32 Smile Stones\". \n\nPS; Dr. Shetty: When I will start my independent research in 3D printing. I hope to have the opportunity to work with you in real time case studies.\n\n",

Dr Shetty is a living example of it. \r\nhe's been my dentist since I was a collage kid, he saved a pair of my tooth... twice.\r\nI had a sever tooth decay case for which all dentists I visit advised to remove that and add a dental implant, I was 21 back than, not ready to loose a tooth, that's when I found Dr Shetty's clinic in powai and he was able to do root canal on same tooth that others out rightly said was a dead tooth. \r\nI recently got off another another root canal treatment with him like two weeks ago and this is what I honestly have to say,\r\nDr Shetty is one of the rare professional  who loves his job. once you decide to go with him, you can be assured of the quality and accountability. he takes his job very seriously and continuously gives his best, yet he is very down to earth and candid.\r\nYou can trust my judgement on this, I'm a manager in IT firm by profession, it's my job to observe people ;-)\r\n",

His utmost effort to save a couple of teeth was really praiseworthy. I had 6 seatings with him. Even if I had any issues at home he was always available on call and gave me advise to resolve my issues. Now coming down to the clinic, I think this is like a one stop solution for all your dental problems. He has also created a very comforting environment in he clinic and even plays your favorite music to get you relaxed. This really helps in easing out uncomfortable procedures. If you have any dental issue, I would definitely recommend Dr. Shetty and you can be sure u r in good hands. ****** *** *** ********* ********* *** ******* ****** ***********.\n",

He is very particular about the hygiene levels of his clinic including using face masks, hand-gloves, sterile equipment, etc.  As far as my dental procedure goes, he did an excellent job.  He worked with utmost care & precision & with a personalized touch which resulted in excellent final results.  The crowns which he fitted on me after the root canal procedure were so perfect in terms of shape, size & color that they blended so well with my natural teeth.  He suggested emax crowns which are very natural looking.  Overall it was a great experience.  Dr. Jeevan Shetty as well as his staff are well-mannered & soft spoken.  I give a 100 on 100 for Dr. Jeevan Shetty & his Dental Clinic. ",

While the earlier Doctor has address the issue, but planted a stone for new problem, Cavity between the New Cap and existing teeth (behind the treated one).\r\n\r\nWhile I was expecting that the teeth might have lost, Dr. Shetty has nicely addressed the problem, not only by addressing the Cavity problem (a physics based solution) but also rectified the previous problem by modifying the CAP (an engineering problem).
