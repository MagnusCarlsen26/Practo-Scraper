"Doctor friendliness,Treatment satisfaction,Explanation of the health issue,Value for money,Wait time,","Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"I would like to share my overall experience about my treatment at Dr. Vora‚Äôs clinic. I had gaps in my teeth. The major one was in upper front row teeth. I was very uncomfortable with it for several years. I knew that putting braces could be an option however I was not comfortable with the braces either.. was concerned about how I would look with it..

 

I came to know about Dr. Vora‚Äôs clinic when I was searching for braces treatment on internet. It was one of the options I checked. When I met Dr. Naman Vora first time, he took all my worries away. He explained me the different treatments they had to fix my dental problem. He advised me to go for lingual braces treatment which was perfect for me since the braces are fixed to the back of your teeth and they are not visible while you talk or smile.

 

Cost of the treatment:

Before visiting Dr. Vora‚Äôs clinic I had visited few more doctors and understood various treatments available. The cost of the treatment at Dr. Vora‚Äôs clinic was the lowest among all the clinics I visited. But the quality of treatment was not compromised at all..

 

***** *** ***** ********* ***** ** ** ** ****** *** ************* ** *** ****** *** ***** **** ** he is very nice human being, very friendly and caring person. It happens (perhaps with many of us) that when you talk to your doctor, half of your problems go away. With Dr. Naman I have strongly experienced this right from my first visit. He made me very comfortable, all of my queries were addressed properly every time.

 

Results of treatment:

It will not be an exaggeration if I say that this treatment has changed my life. My confidence level used to be low because of the big gap between front row teeth. I had never thought that with the braces treatment the gaps can be completely closed. The results were visible from 1st or 2nd week of treatment only and obviously I was very happy and excited to see that. After my treatment was over I changed my job also and moved to technical sales where I had to visit customers, travel, make presentations. I am sure, without this treatment I would not have been comfortable and confident to visit different people, make presentations etc. The treatment brought lot of positive changes in my life and this magic was done by Dr. Naman.
