Dr. Amruta took X-ray of my teeth thoroughly and gave it to me on my mobile also for my records. and then she explained me very nicely about my problem and also about overall root canal treatment seating's in layman's language which made me very easy to understand it. She had given me root-canal treatment and also smooth capping (crown) on it. Also i would like to mention this that i am working woman so she adjusted my appointments in evening time which was suitable for me. It was really very good experience Dr. Amruta and will surely visit your clinic every 6 months interval. ",

Post treatment there was no issue with food Lodgement also one of my lower molar crown was fractured which was replaced with a new crown and got a 15 years warranty for the same.

Dr. Amruta took X-ray of my teeth thoroughly and gave it to me on my mobile also for my records. and then she explained me very nicely about my problem and also about overall root canal treatment seating's in layman's language which made me very easy to understand it. She had given me root-canal treatment and also smooth capping (crown) on it. Also i would like to mention this that i am working woman so she adjusted my appointments in evening time which was suitable for me. It was really very good experience Dr. Amruta and will surely visit your clinic every 6 months interval. ",

Post treatment there was no issue with food Lodgement also one of my lower molar crown was fractured which was replaced with a new crown and got a 15 years warranty for the same.
