The clinic is so neat and beautiful and doesn\u2019t look like other dentistry which i\u2019ve Seen earlier. It is positive and feels comfortable when you sit for counselling with her to explain my problem. She is knowledgable with her work and explained the cause and care of teeth in a layman\u2019s Language where I could even understand the medical terms. Her Handwork in using the tools for dental work is superb Because I did not get tired nor pain when she did the cleaning and polishing of my teeth.  \n\nI also had my 5 year old daugther checked as she had two decays in both her grinder teeth. Initially I was wondering how a 5 year kid would react listening to the tools operating but Dr. Siddhi calmed and within no time she finished removing the decay and filled it up. Of course, my daugther cried due to sound of the tools but within 5 minute of dental filling done, she was all Happy and playing. \n\nHer hand stability is superb. Infact seeing her handle my kid, i asked her whether she has done Paediatric dentistry but she hasn\u2019t. She is definitely super and recommended when I have to advise someone for dental care.\n\nThank you Dr. Siddhi for your Care and excellent work. All the best\ud83d\udc4d",

The clinic is so neat and beautiful and doesn\u2019t look like other dentistry which i\u2019ve Seen earlier. It is positive and feels comfortable when you sit for counselling with her to explain my problem. She is knowledgable with her work and explained the cause and care of teeth in a layman\u2019s Language where I could even understand the medical terms. Her Handwork in using the tools for dental work is superb Because I did not get tired nor pain when she did the cleaning and polishing of my teeth.  \n\nI also had my 5 year old daugther checked as she had two decays in both her grinder teeth. Initially I was wondering how a 5 year kid would react listening to the tools operating but Dr. Siddhi calmed and within no time she finished removing the decay and filled it up. Of course, my daugther cried due to sound of the tools but within 5 minute of dental filling done, she was all Happy and playing. \n\nHer hand stability is superb. Infact seeing her handle my kid, i asked her whether she has done Paediatric dentistry but she hasn\u2019t. She is definitely super and recommended when I have to advise someone for dental care.\n\nThank you Dr. Siddhi for your Care and excellent work. All the best\ud83d\udc4d",
