                "review_text": "I recently needed to get some dental work done and I had an excellent experience with Dr.Sejal Jain at Smiles And More Dental Care Center For those with a short attention span, here's my review: Dr.Sejal is a great communicator, has an excellent and calming bedside manner, and as a nervous patient she gave me an excellent, pain-free experience! HIGHLY recommended. For people who have had some bad/painful past experiences with dentists. Unfortunately, I waited almost a months to go to the dentist because I was afraid. So Finally I decided to go in for a visit. When I came in to the clinic Dr.Sejal greeted me with a friendly smile and a warm handshake and I immediately felt more at ease. She took a look at my problem tooth as well as a check of all my other teeth and talked me through the procedure we needed to take on. My hands were immediately sweating and my heart was racing at the thought of the procedure that was about to happen. She gave me some options for anesthesia and I told her of some of my last experiences and my fear, so we made a choice for the best option for me. She put me at ease through the whole numbing process and I knew I was going to be fine. She kindly and patiently talked me through out every step and within minutes of beginning till the end of procedure I was completely relaxed WHICH WAS A MIRACLE! By the time we finished I Just Thanked Her For My RCT(Root Canal Treatment) Done So Smoothly. That night when I lay in bed I had the biggest relief knowing I didn't have to dread making that appointment and was to thankful that it all went so unbelievably well. Thanks to Dr.Sejal and Her Awesome Assistant for such a great experience! I haven't been this happy leaving the dental Clinic in a very long time.",

HIGHLY recommended. For people who have had some bad/painful past experiences with dentists. Unfortunately, I waited almost a months to go to the dentist because I was afraid. So Finally I decided to go in for a visit. When I came in to the clinic Dr.Sejal greeted me with a friendly smile and a warm handshake and I immediately felt more at ease. She took a look at my problem tooth as well as a check of all my other teeth and talked me through the procedure we needed to take on. My hands were immediately sweating and my heart was racing at the thought of the procedure that was about to happen. She gave me some options for anesthesia and I told her of some of my last experiences and my fear, so we made a choice for the best option for me. She put me at ease through the whole numbing process and I knew I was going to be fine. She kindly and patiently talked me through out every step and within minutes of beginning till the end of procedure I was completely relaxed WHICH WAS A MIRACLE! By the time we finished I Just Thanked Her For My RCT(Root Canal Treatment) Done So Smoothly. That night when I lay in bed I had the biggest relief knowing I didn't have to dread making that appointment and was to thankful that it all went so unbelievably well. Thanks to Dr.Sejal and Her Awesome Assistant for such a great experience! I haven't been this happy leaving the dental Clinic in a very long time.",
