What I really liked about Dr Angad that he explained the process very elaborately and also told the risks associated with the procedure very upfront.\nThe clinic charged me very reasonably as compared to other places I had consulted.\nI am writing this review almost after 2 months so as to see any post surgery side effects. So far I am extremely satisfied with the whole experience and I recommend that one should really visit this clinic before finalising a procedure at other clinics in Kandivali area.",

What I really liked about Dr Angad that he explained the process very elaborately and also told the risks associated with the procedure very upfront.\nThe clinic charged me very reasonably as compared to other places I had consulted.\nI am writing this review almost after 2 months so as to see any post surgery side effects.
