Since childhood I have been visiting dentist and rarely have had any doctor win my confidence.\nAfter visiting many doctors I visited DR.PARAG KHATRI and my hunt for a good comforting well  soft spoken dentist ended here..\nI explained my issue and my fear .\n he was polite and explained every query  on the spot.\nOn the day of my implant dr khatri and another doctor who was same natured  comforted me  and were very presice and patient in their work. A big thumbs up for that.\n\nThere was no pain at all while doing the sugery as well as post also was well taken care of.\n  What I liked most that dr khatri after being busy still took time to call me and ask  me how's everything . Which many doctors don't do that . \n\nIt was touching and made me confident to do other dental problems solved only by dr khatri.\n\n They have done the implant but crowning is remaining which I know will be done PERFECT  MATCHED.\n\n Lastly a big big thank u to dr KHATRI, his co Drs and his staff for maintaining hygenie,Taking care if over feared patients like me. and building my confidence.\n100%recommended. \n",

He diagnosed the problem and recommended a repeat root canal as the canals were not cleaned till the root which is why the pain still existed. I had also started getting pain in my upper tooth which my previous dentist diagnosed as \"sensitivity\". When Dr. Parag checked it he mentioned that it was referred pain caused by my wisdom tooth. My root canal was done by a visiting dentist named Nikhil Modi under the supervision of Dr Parag - he was equally professional.\n\nMy advice to everyone is to not choose a dentist only because they charge you less. I went through a 2 month horrendous experience ******* ** ********* ********** While my problem was solved by Dr Parag in just 4 visits. I would recommend him for all your dental problems",

Since childhood I have been visiting dentist and rarely have had any doctor win my confidence.\nAfter visiting many doctors I visited DR.PARAG KHATRI and my hunt for a good comforting well  soft spoken dentist ended here..\nI explained my issue and my fear .\n he was polite and explained every query  on the spot.\nOn the day of my implant dr khatri and another doctor who was same natured  comforted me  and were very presice and patient in their work. A big thumbs up for that.\n\nThere was no pain at all while doing the sugery as well as post also was well taken care of.\n  What I liked most that dr khatri after being busy still took time to call me and ask  me how's everything . Which many doctors don't do that . \n\nIt was touching and made me confident to do other dental problems solved only by dr khatri.\n\n They have done the implant but crowning is remaining which I know will be done PERFECT  MATCHED.\n\n Lastly a big big thank u to dr KHATRI, his co Drs and his staff for maintaining hygenie,Taking care if over feared patients like me. and building my confidence.\n100%recommended. \n",

He diagnosed the problem and recommended a repeat root canal as the canals were not cleaned till the root which is why the pain still existed. I had also started getting pain in my upper tooth which my previous dentist diagnosed as \"sensitivity\". When Dr. Parag checked it he mentioned that it was referred pain caused by my wisdom tooth. My root canal was done by a visiting dentist named Nikhil Modi under the supervision of Dr Parag - he was equally professional.\n\nMy advice to everyone is to not choose a dentist only because they charge you less. I went through a 2 month horrendous experience ******* ** ********* ********** While my problem was solved by Dr Parag in just 4 visits. I would recommend him for all your dental problems",

One required surgery as it was in the formation of a hook, settled in a nerve and the other one was to be extracted. Both were stage 4 decayed.\n1. On my first visit I was greeted with chilled Apple Fizz and a typed prescription with clearly mentioning my issues on one side and medicines on another. He did not poke the decayed teeth instead asked us to get a second x-ray and email the same instead of running around. \n2. We discussed everything else via phone and chat. He was prompt in replying and gave detail replies. \n3. On the D-day it went so smoothly, he kept on chatting and making sure I was not in pain. Both him and his staff member - Sandhya were highly professional. I had very less swelling than I had expected and was able to chew solid food within few hours. He went ahead and enquired about my health in the evening.\n4. Today is my 3rd day after surgery, both teeth are healed, though I still have stitches on. I don't really remember getting it done. \nOverall one of the best experiences, along with that very reasonable fees and various modes of payment. Instead of feeling embarrassed of the decayed teeth, I actually felt confident. Thank you so much Dr. Khatri for the whole experience, truly appreciated. ",

She was now able to use both sides of her teeth while having food. But after trying tye new denture for few days she found that it will need further adjustment. Dr Parag saw her the same morning and did the minor adjustment that needs to be done. The final fit was too good. We are so please with his approach to his patients and for his patience to listen to any issue that we may present to him. Absolutely wonderful experience.. in fact we live in UK, but we now have a dentist in Mumbai.. thanks Dr Parag .. ",

Almost all the teeth capping were in a very crucial and complex stage so much so that any dentist would think twice prior taking the job into his hands.  Dr. Parag & his staff had been kind enough to handle this serious issue and sort it out bringing back the confidence in my mother once again. I sincerely thank Dr. Parag and his staff million times for bringing back the smile not only to my mother but also to us as a family. \nLast but not the least, I found Dr. Parag most genuine a thorough Gentleman and value add without even reminding us about payments till the entire treatment was completed ! :-) :-)    \n",
