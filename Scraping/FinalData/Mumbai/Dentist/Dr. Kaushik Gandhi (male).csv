"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Dental Cleaning,",0,0,YES,"It will be difficult to articulate how grateful I am to Dr. Kaushik Gandhi, but I will attempt to convey all the reasons why anyone can blindly trust his professional services. 

I had been suffering from persistent pain/ sensitivity due to formation of a cavity in one of my molars. The pain was so much that I was taking pain killers everyday and my day to day routines were impacted. I kept pushing the treatment because I thought ' If the cavity itself is causing so much pain, the treatment of the same ( Root Canal Treatment) would be a nightmare'.

However when the pain started getting out of hand, I came across Dr Kaushik on Practo. I believe I am very lucky that this happened.

I spoke with Dr Kaushik for 10 minutes over the call and that was enough for me to book a consultation. He reassured me that I will not feel any pain whatsoever and the entire treatment will be hassle free. And all of that was 100% true. 

Across my 3 sittings which included Consultation, Dental Cleaning, Root Canal, Temporary Cap & permanent cap fitting, these were the highlights:

* No waiting time: I did not have to wait for even 5 minutes before Dr Kaushik began his treatment 

* Hygiene: Dr Kaushik's entire team was clad in PPE suits and utmost importance was given to hygiene 

* Behaviour & Attitude: Dr Kaushik patiently explained the medical nuisances of the treatment and constantly updated me about the next steps. His nature & attitude was very comforting. 

* Quality of Equipment/ Products: All the products and equipment that was used during the treatment was of the highest possible standards- right from the temporary cap to the cements used to the numbing gels.

* No Pain: I will not be exaggerating when I say there was 'zero' pain throughout the treatment. After getting to know Dr Kaushik, I realized that he has spent years studying &Pain and methods to alleviate Discomfort'. 

* End Result: I now have a clean pair of teeth owing the deep cleaning done by Dr Kaushik. The persistent pain has gone. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. 

I have now made it a point to visit Dr Kaushik on a regular basis because I have complete faith in him today. 

To anyone who is confused about where to go for dental problems, I will insist you spend only 5 minutes talking to him- I am sure you will not look anywhere else for dental treatments.

To conclude I want to mention one instance:

I often asked the doctor after various phases of the treatment - ' Is the procedure really done?'. This is because I could not believe how I could not feel even a pinch.",2020-12-30 08:22:15,False,True,Sanket Tiwary,,,

I was aware that a major overhaul will be required for my teeth to be made presentable and for me to be able to smile in a confident manner.

Dr Gandhi was very encouraging and confident right from my first visit on what he can do and achieve for me.

He operates in a meticulously clean environment and makes use of all the latest technology available in his treatment plans.

Based on all this, I decided to go ahead with him for my treatment and I have no regrets.

He did a sterling job in reconstructing my teeth and was quite open with what he can achieve and what he cannot guarantee based upon his observations as well as the Xray and scan reports.

The results that he has achieved over a period of less than two months have been astounding, given the condition of my teeth before.

I noticed that he was passionate and very meticulous in his approach to get the job done to the patient's satisfaction.

I would gladly recommend him for anyone needing advanced dental treatment.

"Doctor friendliness,","Root Canal Treatment (RCT),",0,0,YES,"I have known Dr Kaushik since I was a kid. He did fillings for all my four molars when I was about 10 years old (now I am 35).  His treatment was way advanced for the time then, and nothing has changed now! He keeps abreast with the research and upgrading his knowledge in the field of DENTAL CARE  and brings it to his patients with cutting edge technologies. 

I booked my appointment without a blink as for 25 years  I never had to revisit him or anyone else for the fillings in these years as the job was done perfectly!  This time too the experience was noting short of magical. A painless root canal! I was dreading it as i had heard stories about bitter experiences from friends on how painful it could be. 

The best thing is there's no waiting time whatsoever as that's a policy he wouches by. He is highly experienced and skilled with a an awesome team of two assistants and his lovely wife who looked over my two kids which I was getting treated. The clinic is immaculately maintained, and he uses premium products.

 He explained the whole process with pros and cons to help me take an informed decision on which type of tooth cap I should choose. 

Being a perfectionist at his job, he will do whatever it takes to ensure you get the best! My tooth being small was difficult to scan for an x- ray, but he wouldn't stop retaking x rays until he was convinced.  Moreover he measured my tooth digitally for precession. It was so quick and smooth 
 Also he completed the procedure in just three sittings.

I highly recommend him for all your dental care needs. Thank you doctor for this wonderful experience.

if you want to have your teeth treated by most experienced Dental Specialist....Trust Dr. Kaushik Blindfold.

1st Appointment - Dr Kaushik Gandhi is most experienced Dental Specialist I ever came accross, 
He did full assessment of my current conditions of teeth, suggested me for RCT, gave me a reasonable estimation.

2nd Appointment - Did RCT in 40-45 mins, and its done, it was that simple
