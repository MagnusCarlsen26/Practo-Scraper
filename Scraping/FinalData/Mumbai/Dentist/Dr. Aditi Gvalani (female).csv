The doctor enquired about my family members, whom she treats. Very easy to communicative with. Ofcourse, she had a mask on, but was laughing quite often, which created a friendly and happy environment.  
She explained the existing dental condition, after a thorough examination. Offered alternatives for areas where applicable (eg. Use of numbing gel or local anaesthesia). Suggested alternate treatment options and explained pros and cons. Gave her decision and asked if I was ok with it, before proceeding. 
Doctor's assistant was also friendly and appeared well trained and skilled. 
Treatment was carried out very well, with well-timed 10 sec breaks to catch a breath. So the doctor seems very perceptive to patient's condition and needs. 24 hours post treatment, everything still normal - no post treatment issues.

  I delayed the treatment due to lockdown by popping some antibiotics and painkillers. I went to the clinic only when  lockdown was partially lifted.

In this condition i called Dr. Gwalani and she  prescribed medicines to let the swelling subside as I couldnâ€™t open my mouth for her to work. 

I will share my experience with the clinic here- 
I was skeptical in going to the clinic. But the moment you go in, they check your temperature, you have to sanitise your hands, they give you the PPE kit which includes disposable feet covers and head cap. You are supposed to wear your mask till you are on the patient seat. The staff also wears their masks and keeps the clinic disinfected. Doctors also wear their masks, gloves &  gowns.  
Appointments are well managed so that you donâ€™t have to wait for your turn.
