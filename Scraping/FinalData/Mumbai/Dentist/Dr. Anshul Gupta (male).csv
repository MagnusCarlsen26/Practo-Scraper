,,0,0,YES,"i had gone in for teeth scaling and cleaning, in the past i have had horrible experiences with other dentists hence for a long time i had skipped it, but being a smoker i had to get it done sooner or later. was pleasantly surprised 1st at the place, very upscale, and clean. 2nd the staff was very cordial and understood what i wantes. most importantly dr.anshul is extremely professional in his work, i didn't even feel a slight bit of pain during the entire cleaning process.  highly recommend my my side.
