They took the time to explain the procedure and answered all my questions, making sure I was comfortable throughout the process. The equipment used was modern, and I could tell that hygiene and patient care are top priorities at this clinic.\n\nThe cleaning was thorough yet gentle, and I appreciated the dentist's attention to detail. I left the clinic feeling well taken care of and informed about my dental health.\n\nI highly recommend dentalfix to anyone looking for a reliable and friendly dental clinic. The combination of excellent service, professional staff, and a clean environment makes it my go-to place for dental care.\n\nThank you, Dentalfix, for a great experience!",

They took the time to explain the procedure and answered all my questions, making sure I was comfortable throughout the process. The equipment used was modern, and I could tell that hygiene and patient care are top priorities at this clinic.\n\nThe cleaning was thorough yet gentle, and I appreciated the dentist's attention to detail. I left the clinic feeling well taken care of and informed about my dental health.\n\nI highly recommend dentalfix to anyone looking for a reliable and friendly dental clinic. The combination of excellent service, professional staff, and a clean environment makes it my go-to place for dental care.\n\nThank you, Dentalfix, for a great experience!",

She looks at the overall oral health and suggests treatments that will ensure effective and long lasting oral health. My oral health has improved tremendously. I went to her because I was developing a gap in my teeth and she addressed some other concerns like cavities, tooth sensitivity and tartar deposits. Over a year with her guidance and treatments, my teeth feel much better and I am very conscious about my oral health. Her specialist doctors, the ones who worked on my root canal and my braces have done a fantastic job. They are available if there is a problem and it\u2019s instantly fixed. Dr. Dipika is one of the few doctors who I completely trust!  I would highly recommend a visit to Dentalfix if you are looking at healthy and long lasting oral hygiene. ",

Dr. explained to me the risk in its extraction given the case as well as the complications if the nerve would get damaged during the extraction process. I was bit aapprehensiveabout the result then but given her expertise *** ********* she operated very well without the nerve getting disturbed. \n \n Would want to thank Dr.Dipika and his team for his service. I had read about the reviews she got and hence wanted her advice in my case.. to which she proved herself once again. Very humble, expert and professional at her job. I would definitely recommend Dr.Dipika to others ...\n Thank you\n",

The clinic itself presents a good ambience and puts the mind at ease immediately.  Treatment itself right from identification of the issue to discussion about resolution and the ultimate procedure is performed in a timely and professional manner with ample precautions considering the Covid impact. Like everyone else I am highly scared of dental procedures however the root canal was performed with minimum pain and discomfort. Small things like the soft music always at play during the procedures (mostly Arijit Singh songs) act as a welcome distraction for the mind and show the attention to details to make things as easy for the patient as possible. I would highly recommend Dentalfix to anyone with dental issues. ",
