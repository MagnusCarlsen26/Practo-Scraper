I had an excellent experience with Dr. Nidhi Nagda at her dental clinic. 

She did a fantastic job correcting and aligning my teeth, resulting in a beautiful smile that I am absolutely proud of.

"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Fillings,",0,0,YES,"A pretty late review but it is never too late to share a review!!!
( This isn't a sponsored post)

Growing up in a household that gave a lot of importance to oral health, I was very particular the same focus is given to Vidhisha‚Äôs dental health too. While Vidhisha‚Äôs first set of teeth appeared, I noticed two teeth that were a little different ‚Äì one had a slight stain while one started bleeding. Inspite of persistent reminders to brush twice a day and maximum efforts to keep her away from chocolates, cavity formation had already began (the struggle to get both these done deserves another post ‚Äì Phew!!). 
My hunt for a Pedodontist started and exactly at that time while scrolling through a few posts and pages on Facebook, I came across a reel by @thesmilehousedentistry
wherein the dentist was treating a dental issue on a 5/6 year old.

What did I do before visiting the dentist?
Vidhisha‚Äôs interest towards reading proved to be a biggest advantage for me ‚Äì I read the Peppa pig book titled ‚Äì A visit to the dentist several times and explained to her why keeping teeth clean was important. The parent has to be a role model too - Vidhisha sees me brush my teeth twice (Again getting other family members brush twice and also answer Vidhisha‚Äôs question as to why they do not brush twice is a big pain!!). Screen time also included a few videos on the importance of brushing and dental hygiene.
I called them to understand how the process of visiting them and fixing an appointment worked. Our first visit was in the evening when we were introduced to the staff and Doctors - Nidhi and Shalaka who were extremely warm and welcoming. After examining, we were told the treatment to take up and how it would be carried out. In the entire time we spent there, a lot of effort was taken to make Vidhisha very comfortable and get used to the space. The best thing was the TV that was set up at the ceiling so that the patient could be little distracted while the process was on. We had carried our books too to share the story with the doctors.
I fixed the second follow-up visit on a non-working Saturday considering Vidhisha and I had a holiday. Vidhisha underwent a fluoride treatment which would delay the effect of the cavity that was slowly forming. While the entire process was on, Dr.S as we called Dr. Shalaka kept talking to her as if she was painting her teeth with colours. The conversations they had were exactly at the eye level and each question was patiently answered. Dr.S made sure the Peppa pig series was being screened keeping in mind the earlier interaction we had. The support staff there was equally considerate to our needs and requirements. And what was the goodbye gift we got ‚Äì Peppa pig stickers!! J
Last but not the least, appreciate the team for considering the request put forth by me to mask Vidhisha‚Äôs face while taking any pictures and videos and later sharing on social media.
It has been almost 6 months now ‚Äì so far so good. We will soon visit them to understand if the treatment done is all fine or any more changes have to be made!

Thank you team once again!
