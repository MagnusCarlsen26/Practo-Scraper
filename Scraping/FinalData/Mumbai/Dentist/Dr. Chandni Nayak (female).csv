Highly recommend! Going to the dentist is not my favorite thing to do but I know I’m in good hands with Dr. Chandni. She works with utmost care and puts in a lot of time and effort to get the desired results keeping the patients best interest in mind. I loved her work, she is a perfectionist! She is friendly, compassionate and very professional. Even with a cavity check up for my little daughter she explained and spoke to her like shes talking to a grown woman and convinced her about the procedure for check up was pain free and wouldn’t hurt one bit. That made my daughter happy too, to readily sit and also have a chat with her.",2024-07-31 16:02:23,False,True,Mrs Memon ,,,
"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","Aesthetic Dentistry,",0,0,YES,"I recently had a composite filling done by Dr. Chandni Nayak and I couldn't be more pleased with the experience. From the moment I walked into the office, I felt welcomed and at ease. The staff was friendly and professional, and Dr. took the time to explain the procedure in detail, answering all my questions thoroughly.

The filling process was quick and painless. Dr. Chandni's expertise and gentle touch made all the difference. The composite filling looks and feels natural, and I can't even tell the difference from my original tooth. I appreciate the high-quality materials used and the meticulous care taken to ensure a perfect fit.

I recently had a root canal treatment with Dr. Chandni , and I couldn't be more pleased with the experience. From the moment I walked into the office, Dr  and the staff were welcoming and professional. Dr. Chandni explained the procedure in detail, addressing all my concerns with patience and clarity. The treatment itself was surprisingly smooth and virtually painless, thanks to her skillful technique and gentle approach. Throughout the process, I felt well-cared for and informed. I highly recommend Dr. Chandni for anyone needing endodontic care—her expertise and compassionate care truly make a difference.

,,0,0,YES,"We were referred to Dr. Chandni by a family friend when I had a persistent toothache. After an X-ray, it was clear that an extraction was necessary.

My experience with Dr. Chandni has been exceptionally smooth, convenient, and surprisingly pain-free. I've always been afraid of injections, but Dr. Chandni's expertise made all the difference. She explained the entire procedure in detail, and because of my age (69) and the minimal bone available for an implant, she consulted with top specialists in Mumbai. They devised a solution that made me feel very confident about the extraction and implant process.

During the procedure, Dr. Chandni's touch was so gentle that I hardly noticed it. My daughter, who is terrified of dentists, now only trusts Dr. Chandni. Thank you, Dr. Chandni, for your exceptional care, thorough follow-ups, and most importantly, the pain-free experience. You are truly a godsend.
