My journey to find the right solution for my left front tooth, which had been dead since childhood, led me through numerous consultations in my home state of Odisha, where implantation was repeatedly suggested as the only option. However, upon relocating to Mumbai and discovering Dr. Ritu's expertise, I found a glimmer of hope.\n\nFrom the moment I reached out to her, Dr. Ritu displayed not only professionalism but also genuine care and empathy. She took the time to understand my unique situation and concerns, reassuring me with her extensive knowledge and experience. What truly sets Dr. Ritu apart is her commitment to providing the best possible outcome while prioritizing minimally invasive techniques.\n\nUnder Dr. Ritu's expert care, I underwent internal bleaching to rejuvenate the shade of my tooth, avoiding the need for invasive procedures like implantation. The results were beyond my expectations - my smile was transformed with natural-looking, seamless results. Dr. Ritu's meticulous attention to detail and artistic touch ensured that my restored tooth blended seamlessly with the rest of my smile.\n\nNot only did Dr. Ritu deliver exceptional results, but she also made the entire experience comfortable and stress-free. Her friendly demeanor and gentle approach instantly put me at ease, making each visit to her clinic a pleasant and enjoyable experience.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Ritu highly enough for anyone seeking expert dental care in Mumbai. Her skill, compassion, and dedication to patient satisfaction make her a true gem in the field of dentistry. Thank you, Dr. Ritu, for restoring not just my smile but also my confidence!",

My journey to find the right solution for my left front tooth, which had been dead since childhood, led me through numerous consultations in my home state of Odisha, where implantation was repeatedly suggested as the only option. However, upon relocating to Mumbai and discovering Dr. Ritu's expertise, I found a glimmer of hope.\n\nFrom the moment I reached out to her, Dr. Ritu displayed not only professionalism but also genuine care and empathy. She took the time to understand my unique situation and concerns, reassuring me with her extensive knowledge and experience. What truly sets Dr. Ritu apart is her commitment to providing the best possible outcome while prioritizing minimally invasive techniques.\n\nUnder Dr. Ritu's expert care, I underwent internal bleaching to rejuvenate the shade of my tooth, avoiding the need for invasive procedures like implantation. The results were beyond my expectations - my smile was transformed with natural-looking, seamless results. Dr. Ritu's meticulous attention to detail and artistic touch ensured that my restored tooth blended seamlessly with the rest of my smile.\n\nNot only did Dr. Ritu deliver exceptional results, but she also made the entire experience comfortable and stress-free. Her friendly demeanor and gentle approach instantly put me at ease, making each visit to her clinic a pleasant and enjoyable experience.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Ritu highly enough for anyone seeking expert dental care in Mumbai. Her skill, compassion, and dedication to patient satisfaction make her a true gem in the field of dentistry. Thank you, Dr. Ritu, for restoring not just my smile but also my confidence!",

We have been consulting Dr Ritu from 2015, when she was practicing in Delhi, especially for our son who was 5 then.\nWe did find Dr Ritu very considerate at our very first visit. Not only she would explain the whole problem very well but would go an extra mile seeking expert opinion from her colleagues and other specialists. This is not something a normal practitioner would do as they would simply refer you to other specialists. We were highly impressed by her friendly and super down to earth nature as she provided the consultation as a friend. And as usually told, if your doctor is considerate and friendly, it is half cure done automatically. That is exactly the case with Dr Ritu.\nAfter 2017,  we moved to Australia and have been seeing the Dentists here as our son has now grown to 11. We were not very confident with the solutions to our problem being suggested here and were looking to seek other opinion when we gathered the thought of consulting Dr Ritu again.  We called her to seek an online appointment and I should not say that to our utter surprise, but kind of expectedly, she was straight away able to recognise us and had a complete remembrance of the whole case even though it had been more than 5 years since we had consulted her. Neither did she very patiently listened to our problem but as always, did explain everything to us in detail, got the case discussed with her specialists panel and came back to us with the right solution. And for all this to happen, it did not take weeks or months, but all on  the same day within hours of consulting her again. We managed to get so much more details and options that we can now discuss with doctors here in Australia.Dr Ritu really cares for her patients and leaves no stone unturned to get to the best possible treatment.\nEven though she would have reached to the next level of her career over these years but her way of treating her patients has not changed a bit.\nWe are really thankful to her for consultations there in Delhi and now from here in Australia.

I am not a dentist friendly person, and letting someone operate was one big challenge. I met with her with limited confidence, unsure about returning for another appointment. In the first appointment she chalked out a six-month plan to address my decade old dental issues that included \u2013 5 Implants, 1 Bridge, 4 Root Canals and may be more. She gave me confidence I could see thru the end of these everlasting problems and will have my smile back. She got one of the best Implant surgeon Dr Manish who took care of 2 extractions and 5 implants in one sitting. He is one another GEM! \n\nA few things to note about Dr Ritu \u2013 She is very professional *** *** ** *** **** ******** ** *** ******* She aspires perfection in work. If you ever visit her clinic, first thing you will not notice is that her clinic is very hygienic, clean, and tidy. Thank you, once again, Dr Ritu.",

Highly Recommended.\n\nReason we went-My father hd recently remvd  a tooth bt had anothr tooth decay- left side which had to be remvd in few days but swelling and bad tooth ache ws troubling... While he was having antibiotics (18-20)tablets in total as advisd a doc(apparently extremely high!!), but it wasn't giving any relief. Swelling, lack of sleep + diabetes also worsened and we decided to have 2nd opinion urgently.\n\nThat's when we came across Dr. Ritu who gave acmdtd last min request. She quickly identified the issue, did a quick scan and explained the situation. A procedure to remove the puss bcos of decay was done immediately and gave us a roadmap of further treatment. Father had relief, swelling gone and cud sleep peacefully at night. Further treatment awaited but atleast a relief for now. \nSuggestion- discount for senior citizens",

By the end of my treatment, I was extremely satisfied and happy for having got the treatment done by her. Since the last few years, I have been facing number of issues like cavities, plaque buildup, and brittleness in teeth which led to increased dental visits and painful treatments. Dr. Ritu listened to my issues patiently and suggested treatments she can do and steps for me to improve my dental hygiene and well-being. I got root canal, teeth cleanups and composite fillings done over several sessions. She was very respectful about my professional commitments and always tried to provide appointments which would work best for me. Her treatment has definitely been very effective and spot on. Additionally, the empathy she showed for the discomfort and pain which we as patients go through has been very kind and sweet - this reflects in her speed of treatment, handling of instruments, keeping us informed of what she is doing as we can\u2019t see the treatment ourselves. Moreover, she proactively following up with us after the sessions is something which I thought were genuinely caring. Overall, it\u2019s Dr. Ritu\u2019s way of handling patients, both, on and off the dental chair is what makes us trust her to get our dental acts together.",

We felt very satisfied as she explained each and everything using x-ray n pictures. \nShe is very positive in her nature and advised for a RCT which she did following a course of some antibiotics n medicines. \nAfter the root canal, my mother is feeling very relaxed and not a single bit of pain is left. Moreover She has filled the tooth with permanent filling which is exactly the same color as of tooth that's why you can't say by looking at the tooth that it has undergone some treatment.\nAlso she is always ready to help us out even at the odd times. I once called her at late night for asking about some medicines as my mother was feeling certain heaviness in tooth after root canal and she directed in the best possible way.\nEven the assistant she had is very helping and experienced .\nI recommend you all to visit Dr Ritu Rampal for any kind of dental problem. \nThankss Dr Ritu for the treatment!!

Screams of tooth extraction, sound of that dental drill \u2013 good reason to be phobic to them.\n\nBut these impressions turn hogwash when you visit Dr. Ritu Rampal. The most pleasant of all the doctors I have met. \n\nShe has a fine understanding of dentistry nitty-gritties and possess vast experience. She explains the issue cause articulately, using drawings if required to convince patients. These very traits help great deal in boosting patient\u2019s confidence before the treatment.\nI had an RCT on one of my tooth, completely pain free, contrary to my initial impression. Though, I developed tooth sensitivity after the treatment, but doctor Ritu proactively and regularly followed up for a good time after the RCT to ensure the sensitivity issue is ********** resolved. And, yes the issue is indeed resolved now!  The capped tooth feels like the natural tooth as if the RCT was never done.\n\nSincere thanks to the doctor once again!\n",

However, she was kind enough to stay in touch and helped me manage my pain throughout the lockdown period. She would often drop messages to check on my well being, give detailed feedback on pictures of the problem I would share and if need be, would even consult over a video call and all this without ever charging me a penny. Had it not been for Dr. Ritu, I would not have survived the 4 months of lockdown!\n\nI finally got a chance to visit her clinic after she resumed work in August. I was mighty impressed with the amount of safety procedures she has implemented in her clinic to ensure the well being of her patients in these difficult times. Over the months, she had come to know how much I dreaded visiting a dentist and spent a lot of time explaining me the whole treatment procedure. She made sure to stop every time I felt slightest of discomfort and ensured that I did not feel any pain throughout the procedure, making the whole experience rather joyful. Although this was first of the many visits that I would need to make for additional procedures that I require to get back to 100%, I am no longer scared of visiting a dentist and am already looking forward to my next sitting.\n\nAs long as my work allows me to continue to stay here in Mumbai, Dr. Ritu will always be my preferred choice of dentist :)",

But she explained about the condition of my teeth so well that she convinced me  for both extraction and flexible Dentures, she is just very good so understanding and knowledgeable of the problem she is very patient & has such a good hand very comforting and calming. My extraction was painless. It is healing well and I am looking forward to have my Dentures done. \nIt is a pleasure to be treated by her. One of the best Dentist. ",

Dr Ritu was the first person to call me up and asked me about my situation and suggested me to visit her once so that she can check what is the exact problem. Since it was the very first time I had such problem in my life,I didn't know what to do. Next day, I visited her clinic in C2 block and got my checkup done. After the checkup she told me that I'll have to go for a root canal treatment  got scared but she motivated me and told me there is nothing to be scared. I trusted her and I'm glad that I went to her for my treatment, She handled it so well that my fear of visiting a dentist got away and the entire process of the Root canal went through without any problem. I'd like to thank her for giving me the best treatment and would love to visit again in future. I'd also recommend  you guys to visit her if you have any problem because she know how to do her work and she does it very passionately. A big thumbs up to Dr Ritu. Keep up the good work Doc.",

Just keeping the teeth clean will help them stay healthy. She explained everything in detail and gave her honest opinion. She is very thorough and even better explains everything that she sees.

Loved the atmosphere , Dr.Ritu is verrry veryyy friendly and courteous and she explains you what treatment is needed and why. Answers all your questions and concerns patiently and ensures that the procedure is painless. Ritu ma'am changed the entire perception that I initially had regarding root canal treatment. I felt in safe hands throughout my treatment. The clinic maintains an international standard with soft music playing in the background which according to me is soooo verrry rare to find in India. I would recommend her to everyone for getting rid of their dental problems for once and forever. After going to this place, I don't think I need to go to anyone else for dental procedures. ",

While I had many issues, the one bothering the most was identified n fixed properly keeping in mind my background that I cannot take any medicines due to baby feeds. I was so happy that the toothache was fixed properly.\nThe best part for me was, she kept on checking the status of my treatment/pain on WA at regular intervals :-)\nI told her that rest of my oral treatments will be done there only.\nBlessed to have her clinic at a hopping distance.

She took the time to explain every stage of the procedure and even made sure that I was able to see and understand the process while being treated. Her funny one-liners, her explanation of the procedure and, of course, her choice of music playing in the background made sure that I did not feel any pain or discomfort throughout the process. Dr Ritu has a cheerful personality and she made my dental procedure a rather delightful experience. \ud83d\ude04",

On recommendation of My brother ( also a dental patient), I approached Dr Ritu Rampal. \n\nI specifically requested Dr Ritu if all the dental treatments can be completed in a week or so. She, after throrough clinical analysis, designed a really effective and effiecient trestment plan that comprised of RCT, Dental fillings and Post and core procedure. \n\nShe practically saved my long ignored and decaying tooth. And i cant thank her enough for that. Infact, Not only did she save my tooth, she also saved me a fortune as well by offering reasonably priced yet high quality medical procedures as compared to Australia where I live.\n\nOverall, I am very happy that I approached Dr Ritu for my dental treatments, and would highly recommend her to anyone who wants only the best when it comes to Healthcare. \n\nThank you, Dr Ritu !!!",

I appreciate the fact that they did not keep me waiting . I was on time for my appointment, there was a patient who was winding up and then they took me in. the clinic is so clean and hygienic tools were used. (Trust me , many places don\u2019t even clean the checking stick they use) Dr.Ritu even followed back to see if I am recovering well..much appreciated! Thank you! I am glad to have found them.will definitely recommend her.",

The doctors in goa immediately declined for the treatment as they told me it would take about a year and half for complete process. Meanwhile dr ritu completed the process within 4-5 months with her methods and quick treatments. I used to travel all the way from goa to mumbai(600 km) for this treatment and trust me it was all worth it. Thank you very much doctor!!",

I believe she has a excellent hands on experience in her field as my daughter was happy to go to her for the consecutive sittings. That means child had experienced less or little pain during the sittings and her approach towards the little ones are also very pleasing. She has completed one RCT ( for the abcess ) and two teeth filling in our three visits. Also she tries her best for revival of teeth until unless recovery of the same is 0%.\n\nExcellent in time management also as she ensures minimum waiting period for the patients.",

I have known her for ten plus years, and have never been let down by her. This time my mom had root extractions, numerous fillings and tooth reconstructions, scaling and what not. These were handled so smoothly, diligently, aptly, painlessly by Dr. Ritu. She explained everything explicitly before and after the procedure. My mom is a senior citizen and Dr. Ritu took utmost care of her all through. If the pandemic gives me another window, I will definitely be taking her back to Dr. Ritu for further treatments in near future. \n\nThank you so much Dr. Ritu for all your kindness !!\nIt\u2019s people like you who make a difference to this world!!! \nOne has so much to learn from your selfless service to humanity!\nKeep up your good efforts!\n\nGC",

The best thing I have noticed about the dentist is her guidance on taking preventive measures along with change in lifestyle to keep the gum and tooth healthy rather than prescribing lot of medicines or gels. The other quality of this dentist worth highlighting is she does not attend those problems where she has not got the expertise. Rather she calls an expert with good experience of handling similar kind of problem to her clinic to give the treatment.",

She follows up quite regularly and when I was in pain post some of the treatment, she followed up twice a day over whatsapp about the pain and medication I needed to take. She truly cares as a doctor and is good at what she does as well. \n\nDuring Covid, she takes extremely good care of hygiene in her clinic  and has access to other doctors who are experts in other dental areas as well. I would highly recommend, more so for the patient who is keen on making sure that slowly and surely your teeth are brought back into great shape.\n",
