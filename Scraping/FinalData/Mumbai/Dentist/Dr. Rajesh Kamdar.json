This is amazing, very very appreciable. This will keep on helping patients for smooth and better treatment for the future\n\nDoctor studies the problem of the patients in detail and solves them in the best possible manner\n\nTheir staff is, of course, well behaved. Their clinic is situated at well known place called \u201cIrla - Vile Parle West\u201d, that also on the S V Road\n\nFrom the deepest corner of my heart, I wish them a grand and great success for the days to and years to come in the future\n",

Before starting this journey, i was extremely scared because most of them used to say that having braces on is incredibly painful and causes a lot of discomfort. But I\u2019m glad i took this step anyways and under dr Rajesh Kamdar\u2019s supervision. He definitely changed this misconception that having braces on or getting teeth extractions is painful. I can already see a lot of progress in my teeth alignment. Can\u2019t wait to see my new smile! ",

This is amazing, very very appreciable. This will keep on helping patients for smooth and better treatment for the future\n\nDoctor studies the problem of the patients in detail and solves them in the best possible manner\n\nTheir staff is, of course, well behaved. Their clinic is situated at well known place called \u201cIrla - Vile Parle West\u201d, that also on the S V Road\n\nFrom the deepest corner of my heart, I wish them a grand and great success for the days to and years to come in the future\n",

Before starting this journey, i was extremely scared because most of them used to say that having braces on is incredibly painful and causes a lot of discomfort. But I\u2019m glad i took this step anyways and under dr Rajesh Kamdar\u2019s supervision. He definitely changed this misconception that having braces on or getting teeth extractions is painful. I can already see a lot of progress in my teeth alignment. Can\u2019t wait to see my new smile! ",

He is an extrememly talented and experienced  doctor and works on your teeth very very smoothly. Nowadays it is often seen that people have dental problems especially the one which I had (improper position of the teeth) and therefore Wondersmiles is the best place to visit. My teeth have become perfectly fine and looks very nice.  All thanks to Dr Kamdar!",
