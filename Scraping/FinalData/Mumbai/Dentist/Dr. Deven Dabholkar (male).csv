"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Dental Fillings,Dental Deep Cleaning,Dental Examinations,",0,0,YES,"I have consulted Dr. Deven with immense pain in one of upper molar. He examined it with xray and suggested initial antibiotics course as there was no sign of decay instead of root canal. Luckily pain was reduced in few days. Couple of times in past, other dentists have directly suggested root canal for me and later I found that root cause was different. 

He did fillings to few other teeth which I was not aware about decay as there was no pain there. After few days, I was able to find the difference while chewing and gums were also into right shape. 

I would definitely recommend him for his honest suggestions and treatment to the point. ",2023-09-26 18:51:57,False,True,Verified Patient,,,

1. Patient was in her 9th month of pregnancy and hence no xray could be taken inspite it was a very deep cavity with more than half of tooth structure decayed. Patient was informed that we are doing this filling in order to avoid the Root canal treatment at this stage considering her condition.
2. We have a policy to give bill to everyone, though it is possible that we might have asked to kindly collect the bill later. At no point in history of our clinic we have ever denied the bill to our patient.",2023-04-11T13:57:07+0000,Dr. Deven Dabholkar
