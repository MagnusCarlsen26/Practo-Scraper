Read a lot of reviews before going and the doctors did not disappoint when it comes to making you feel comfortable and in a safe space.\n5/5 for services rendered by Dr. Nikita\n\nHowever, I am not very satisfied with the end result.\nWriting this review around 12 days after the procedure has been done.\nCleaning part was good. But whitening and bleaching hasn't been effective.\nOn a shade card, i may have gone 2-3 shades lighter. That's it. Not even close to white.\n\nEven have some rough feeling on 2 of my teeth - including 1 pre-molar. \n\nExpected a better end result from the process. Not satisfied. I don't even know the next steps now.\n1.5/5 for the result.\n\nWould appreciate if someone can call me up from the clinic and advice on what can be done to make the situation better.\n\nEven though Dr. Nikita was a gem of a doctor, I am not happy with the result!",

The remarkable patience with which Dr. Nikita listened to my doubts, fears and anxieties regarding visiting a dentist and other teeth related issues,  is something I have not seen with doctors here in Mumbai. There was no rush to just dismiss off the patient and immediately be done with the treatment.I kept on asking  questions and she calmly listened and answered and made me stay relaxed throughout the procedure.  So a big thumbs up on that!Im very satisfied with the treatment and would surely visit them again in future.With their extremely hygienic clinic, state of the art equipments and machines, they are quite affordable :)I would highly recommend this clinic to everyone for various dental treatments.Thanks a lot  Smile Concepts!\ud83d\ude4f",

But whitening and bleaching hasn't been effective.\nOn a shade card, i may have gone 2-3 shades lighter. That's it. Not even close to white.\n\nEven have some rough feeling on 2 of my teeth - including 1 pre-molar. \n\nExpected a better end result from the process. Not satisfied. I don't even know the next steps now.\n1.5/5 for the result.\n\nWould appreciate if someone can call me up from the clinic and advice on what can be done to make the situation better.\n\nEven though Dr. Nikita was a gem of a doctor, I am not happy with the result!",

The remarkable patience with which Dr. Nikita listened to my doubts, fears and anxieties regarding visiting a dentist and other teeth related issues,  is something I have not seen with doctors here in Mumbai. There was no rush to just dismiss off the patient and immediately be done with the treatment.I kept on asking  questions and she calmly listened and answered and made me stay relaxed throughout the procedure.  So a big thumbs up on that!Im very satisfied with the treatment and would surely visit them again in future.With their extremely hygienic clinic, state of the art equipments and machines, they are quite affordable :)I would highly recommend this clinic to everyone for various dental treatments.Thanks a lot  Smile Concepts!\ud83d\ude4f",

So, when I went for my appointment with Dr. Nikita Motwani, first she listened to me about my worries. Dr. Nikita made certain I was very comfortable, she gently and painlessly numbed me completely before starting the work. During the procedure, Dr. Nikita kept asking me if I was comfortable and also explained exactly what was being done to fix the problems. Upon completing the dental work, I was given clear information on what to expect. I was surprised, post dental work, I didn't get the pain from the drilling as always felt in the past. \n\nI am truly grateful to you for taking care of my teeth. Thank you Dr. Nikita!",
