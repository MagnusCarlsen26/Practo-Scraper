The procedure of my tooth extraction was performed quickly, in less than 10 minutes and there was no pain when my tooth was pulled out. The staff was very helpful and made me feel relaxed. I am very happy with my visit and would look forward to seeing them again for my routine dental treatment.",

                "review_text": "I went to Emerald Glow Dental Centre as my tooth was hurting and I was in pain. I was really scared and anxious, but  Dr. Saba Rasool immediately put me at ease. She was very attentive to my anxiety and did a great job to make me feel comfortable. Her explanation was thorough and clear. The procedure of my tooth extraction was performed quickly, in less than 10 minutes and there was no pain when my tooth was pulled out. The staff was very helpful and made me feel relaxed. I am very happy with my visit and would look forward to seeing them again for my routine dental treatment.",
