I hardly felt any pain during treatment whether done by Dr. Shruti or by Dr. Urvisha, it was definite sign of gentle and crafty hands at work. Also the precise and accurate details of implants were made sure for implants longevity. The experience was definitely better than my previous visits to other dental clinics.\nI never had to wait at all during so many visits.

Now I am feeling relieved of my teeth issues due to her excellent treatment. Dr Shruti also explained how to take care of my teeth and gums  to avoid further complications.

The use of digital X-rays and diagnostic tools ensured accurate assessments and precise treatments.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Shruti\u2019s Smile Creator  for anyone seeking outstanding dental care in a welcoming and comfortable environment.

Dr Shruti initially checked my teeth issues and planned the treatment well so that I got confidence to undergo it as I was having fear of injections and intolerance to pain. \nMy treatment went well which included teeth extraction, RCT etc. I visited her clinic regularly and completed my treatment. Now I am feeling relieved of my teeth issues due to her excellent treatment. Dr Shruti also explained how to take care of my teeth and gums  to avoid further complications. I would like to strongly recommend Dr Shruti for undergoing dental treatment of any kind.",

Her extensive knowledge and ability to communicate complex dental procedures in a simple and understandable manner was truly impressive.\n\n Her gentle nature reduced any anxiety my mom had, making the entire experience much more pleasant than I anticipated.\n\nThe clinic itself was well equipped. The use of digital X-rays and diagnostic tools ensured accurate assessments and precise treatments.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Shruti\u2019s Smile Creator  for anyone seeking outstanding dental care in a welcoming and comfortable environment. I am grateful to have found such a wonderful dental clinic.",
