And she made the whole process seem so simple and painless. I was relaxed the whole time and she informed me of all the steps she was performing beforehand so there were no surprises. \r\n\r\nThis is my second visit to her - the first one was a couple of months ago for a dental cleaning. Even on that occasion, especially because it was the first time in my life I ever got any dental procedure done - I started off feeling very nervous. But after meeting Dr. Upasana and talking about the procedure, I felt very calm and relaxed throughout. \r\n\r\nDr. Upasana is very friendly and kind, unlike most Doctors who are very dismissive and hurried. She is also very knowledgable about her profession and is open to answering all kinds of doubts - even those that don't concern the specific treatment that I was undergoing.  \r\n\r\nShe also isn't very stern about payments - my best friend got a set of braces done from Dr. Upasana's clinic and she didn't demand the full payment in advance. She has allowed my friend the option of pacing out the payments over several months. This can be very handy for people who have a cash flow issue but also have severe dental problems.\r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend her to all my friends, neighbours and colleagues. ",

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by friendly staff who made me feel at ease. The clinic was clean and well-maintained, which gave me confidence in the cleanliness of their dental equipment.\n\nMy dental hygienist was knowledgeable and took the time to explain the process of the cleaning to me. She was gentle but thorough, and made sure that I was comfortable throughout the entire procedure. I was also pleasantly surprised that the entire cleaning was completed in a timely manner, without feeling rushed.\n\nOverall, I had a positive experience at iSmile Clinic and would highly recommend their dental cleaning service. The staff was professional, the clinic was clean, and the service was excellent. I will definitely be returning for my future dental needs.",

This shows her nature and to go out of the way to help out patients and understanding to the constraints faced by patients.\n\nOverall, I would recommend anyone in Mumbai to definitely go to Dr. Upasana for all of your dental problems and inquiries!",

My anxiety gone, and my cavity is getting treated after a decade. Hats off to this lady Dr. Upasna, she is doing a great job.

The staff was very welcome, polite and the clinic was maintained very hygenically clean. Dr.Upsana further explained me the root cause and suggested me the course for treatment. Dr.Upsana was very friendly, approachable and very knowledgeable and treatment was done smoothly without any pain. Even though i had sensitivity in my teeth but she handled with great care making myself comfortable and her years long experience has truly helped for my successful treatment. I truly recommend Dr.Upasana for the Dental treatment due to her knowledge, skills, experience, positive attitude and friendly approach towards patients. I was very happy with the quality of the treatment as its fully worth the value.",

It was a pure force from the family that made me go see her for consultation. She's a calm and sorted and knows what she's doing. The most important part about any dentist is they need to have gentle hands while operating and I bet you she does. My treatments were really smooth and I could hardly feel anything.  She explained me everything right from my dental problems to every procedure that she was operating on me. All my feedbacks post sittings were taken into account and she'd work on them till the problem was resolved. Now you don't get this with many dentists. I strongly recommend her. She'll sort our your dental problems just like she did mine.",

I've undergone dental treatments by some of the leading dentists in Mumbai and can safely say Dr. Gosalia's quality and standards are at par and that too at much reasonable and affordable rates.\nExtremely satisfied with the services and would highly recommend Dr. Gosalia for any dental treatment. Also the only dental clinic I've visited that served and allowed green tea immediately after treatment :) \n",

She examined and suggested long lasting procedure for my entire denture. She explained the entire procedure on first day itself so I was mentally prepared however I did suffer any problem / pain during the treatment.It took about a month for the treatment which she did with kindness, patience and professionally with least pain to me. \nI strongly recommend Dr.Upasana Gosalia for any small or major dental issues.\n",

The next morning my swelling had comparatively subsided and in the next 2 days it ws gone completely without eating any painkillers or anything. Great Experience. Would definitely recommend her.. ",

She has solved this one problem I had with my teeth that no other dentist has been able to and I had consulted four different dentists before I came to I-Smile, she knows her trade well. She's also very\u00a0accommodating\u00a0in case you have to reschedule your appointment and her patience is worth admiring. It is also very convenient that you can pay through Paytm or Bank Transfer because I don't carry a lot of cash.\n\nI always go for a second opinion for the sake of prudence but this is one doctor I've come to trust.\n\n",

Overall... she did her job fantastic, got my tooth extracted with no pains at all...thanks a tonne dr upasana. ",
