But the frontal weak dentures needed to be fixed at the earliest due to repeated breaks in all front teeth.\nI wanted a complete solution of my upper denture without affecting my work which is a more into customer handling.  There was no chance I could leave without a front teeth for long. Surprisingly she gave me acrylic dentures till my stitches and implant healed inside. \nThis is something I am really happy about and the final product that came after the period of healing was just perfect. \nI am very glad to have it done by her only. \nI can definitely advise her as a very good dentist. My son is also having dental issue resolution through her only. And yes there is smooth payment plan.\nThat\u2019s it",

Dr. Wanchede is incredibly polite and respectful to her patients, creating a welcoming atmosphere that puts both children and parents at ease. Typically, kids are apprehensive about visiting doctors and dentists, but I was amazed to see my daughter excited for her follow-up visit. This speaks volumes about Dr. Wanchede's excellent approach and skill. Thanks to her expertise, the issue has been resolved permanently. I highly recommend Dr. Wanchede for anyone seeking a compassionate and highly competent dentist.",

Dr. Wanchede is incredibly polite and respectful to her patients, creating a welcoming atmosphere that puts both children and parents at ease. Typically, kids are apprehensive about visiting doctors and dentists, but I was amazed to see my daughter excited for her follow-up visit. This speaks volumes about Dr. Wanchede's excellent approach and skill. Thanks to her expertise, the issue has been resolved permanently. I highly recommend Dr. Wanchede for anyone seeking a compassionate and highly competent dentist.",

Thinking of any treatment for my tooth would mean lots of pain and lots of money. So I chose to carry on a tooth less till my 60 year friend told me that he is doing implant for 8 to 10 teeth. I was shocked at 60....I was curious and asked him the procedure. He told me it was minimal pain and the doctor is very supportive though a little expensive. I waited for him to complete his implants to see the results. Oh it was amazing his smile widened and neatly, in was zapped. He checked with him if he could eat normally without pain and he said yes. Still the fear of pain overcame this feedback. After three months I checked with him again and he said that the implants is not giving any trouble. Then I made up my mind to meet his dentist. I met her and she mentioned it would be a smooth process. The way the dentist explained to me put me at ease. I started the process and as explained by the dentist it was a painless journey. No swelling of the face, no strong medicines, no nausea feeling. Today my tooth is back in its place. Thanks to Dr. Ruupali for all the care and making a diifference to my smile. Dr. Rupali was very caring and gentle while speaking. She responded to every query with gentleness and patience. She spent time with you to explain in detail. Thanks Doctor.\n",
