,"RCT - Root Canal Treatment,",0,0,YES,I went there for a 2nd opinion for my mom's tooth ache as a week before I took her to some other dentist and she suggested for tooth extraction which we doubted. Dr. Deshmukh could correctly identify that my mom has got pain n 2 teeth and those needs rct and not extraction. Since we are coming from Malad she completed most of her job and needs 3 more sittings. ,2023-05-07 07:43:11,False,True,Verified Patient,,,
