When I got diagnosed with a serious Jaw issue which needed immediate surgery I met all top maxillofacial surgeons in Mumbai including Dr. Khambay. One meeting with him is all it took for me to be convinced about which surgeon gets to insert the scalpel into my mouth. I have been in touch with the good doctor over texts, phone calls & monthly visits from the last 6 months now. His pleasing personality & affable nature plays an equal role in the healing process. Highly recommended for any major surgery related to jawline or facial reconstruction. Thank you Sir for all your help & support.",
