We sincerely regret for your unpleasant experience.

Because several of your teeth were in poor condition we have informed you that scaling and polishing will not improve the shade of your teeth and you'll require capping for the destroyed teeth.

Nevertheless we made every effort to get rid of stains as much as we could.

Regarding the price as we previously mentioned ,you hadn't had your teeth cleaned in a long time meant that they were in pretty bad state, that's why the charges were high.

We greatly value your input,and the areas we need to improve will be addressed.
We appreciate your visit.
Thank you
