When I entered the clinic..There  were 2 person sitting at the waiting area. They made one person sit in other room and another far away from me..to maintain social distance from me. They entered my details took my O2 ,checked my body temperature and Bp for safer side...gave me my safety wear and instructions not to touch anywhere..The doctor was also very soft spoken checked my teeth advised to go for cleaning and took some x-rays and informed me about my cavities....I was very much satisfied by Dr.Hetal's  consultation. Also did my few cavities..I highly recommend to visit her clinic once.##SmileGallery Dental clinic###Thank you soo much for solving and clearing my \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0ddoubt to all staff and doctor.",

Dr. Hetal and her team are specialized in their work and take up every task with thorough precision and perfection with very modern dental technologies. It was good to see that dr. Hetal herself with all her decades of experience, addresses issues  of patients by herself, unlike other places where junior dentists  experiment on our teeth, that gave confidence to me and her counseling and computerized status of my existing tooth decays due to years of acidity, that I opted for cosmetic dentistry to give strength and beauty to my over all teeth.\n- [ ] My entire teeth fillings were done very articulately which enhanced my overall face and smile, many thanks to Dr. Hetal, Dr. Ritu and sister Shweta & Kavita. I think my search on internet to find right dentist since quite sometime,ends at Smile Gallery Dental clinic, many thanks \ud83d\ude01",
