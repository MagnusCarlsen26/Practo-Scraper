Our daughter had a bad experience with a previous dentist and was terrified to go to the dentist again. After search on internet about pediodontist we found Dr. Mihir Shah\u2019s clinic address. Because of her past experience we thought we were going to have to put her under local anesthesia to have the work done. But the way doctor interacts with my daughter, now she is very comfortable during whole process. Doctor explains us before & during treatment clearly about whatever he is doing with my daughter. And the best part is that he gives gifts to our daughter every time. I highly recommend this doctor for any dental problem of kids. ",

He ruled out the option of general anaesthesia. He treated my 5 year old child with patience and care, surprisingly she cooperated with him and now all her tooth problems are gone . I was in short of time as I had to return to bangalore, dr understood the severity and gave me all possible time so that my daughters treatment could be completed. \nWe got her treated in much lesser amount when compared to what was quoted by other doctors . \nThanks a lot doctor .

Because of her past experience we thought we were going to have to put her under local anesthesia to have the work done. But the way doctor interacts with my daughter, now she is very comfortable during whole process. Doctor explains us before & during treatment clearly about whatever he is doing with my daughter. And the best part is that he gives gifts to our daughter every time. I highly recommend this doctor for any dental problem of kids. ",

My daughter was advised general anaesthesia by other doctors as her molars were all decayed and she had refused to cooperate of all the doctors i had met .I luckily found dr Mihir on practo and consulted him . He ruled out the option of general anaesthesia. He treated my 5 year old child with patience and care, surprisingly she cooperated with him and now all her tooth problems are gone . I was in short of time as I had to return to bangalore, dr understood the severity and gave me all possible time so that my daughters treatment could be completed. \nWe got her treated in much lesser amount when compared to what was quoted by other doctors . \nThanks a lot doctor . A big thanks to you from Naisha too . ",
