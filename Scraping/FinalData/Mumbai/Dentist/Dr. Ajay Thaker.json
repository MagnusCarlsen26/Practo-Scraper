From the moment I stepped into the clinic, I was greeted with a warm smile and genuine concern for my well-being. What truly impressed me was the way Dr. Ajay balanced professionalism with a personable touch. Every step of the way, I was thoroughly informed about the procedures, and my questions were patiently answered. The wisdom tooth extraction and root canals were carried out with such expertise and precision that I felt minimal discomfort and the whole experience was surprisingly easy and soothing.All the support staff and other doctors commitment in Smiles Royale clininc to making patients feel comfortable is truly commendable. I felt genuinely cared for, and it made all the difference. The positive atmosphere they create contributes to the overall experience.I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Ajay Thaker to anyone seeking dental care.

The clinic is clean and well-maintained, with a welcoming atmosphere that immediately put me at ease.\n\nI was treated by Dr Ashwini Malhotra. She was thorough in her examination, explaining everything in detail and answering all of my questions. Dr. Ashwini's expertise and skill were evident during the teeth scaling and cavity filling procedures. She worked with precision and care, ensuring that I was comfortable and pain-free throughout the process.\n\nIn addition to Dr. Ashwini's excellent work, I would also like to mention the friendly and helpful staff at Smiles Royale. They were attentive to my needs and made me feel welcome from the moment I walked in the door. Their professionalism and customer service were top-notch, and they played a big role in making my visit to the clinic a positive experience.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Smiles Royale to anyone in need of dental work. They are a top-notch team that truly cares about their patients' wellbeing. Thank you, Smiles Royale and Dr. Ajay Thaker, for your excellent work!",

I used to be very scared of dental treatments earlier, but Dr Ajay Thaker ensured that I feel comfortable during the entire procedure. Dr Ajay correctly diagnosed the issue and provided the best solution for my problem by which my tooth could be saved by root canal treatment instead of extraction. Special thanks to Dr Parth who performed the root canal treatment, he ensured that the entire procedure was painless and comfortable.Also a big thank you to Dr Manju who took the final measurements and ensured that the procedure was painless and comfortable. The clinic is very clean and hygienic, the entire staff is very friendly and helpful. The staff used to give follow up calls to check how I was doing after each of the sittings. Overall, a great team, and one of the best team of dentists in Mumbai. I would highly recommend them based on my experience.",

Both my doctors were friendly, kind, understanding and very informative. They understood my concerns, diagnosed the problems I had and crafted an appropriate treatment plan for me. I had limited time on hand but had a lot of teeth fixes to be done. I requested back to back appointments and promised to be on time and available each time they had an appointment slot. Even though they were quite busy, they accommodated me and finished my entire  treatment, for which I am eternally grateful !! They both are excellent dentists and their priority was that I get the best dental advice and care possible. Each of the doctors meticulously worked on my cavities. They took great care in explaining to me what needs to be done, its importance and their approach towards my teeth.  By far the best dentistry I have been to ! I am delighted with the care my teeth and I got. Thank you doctors! And a special thanks to the front desk staff and the support staff that were always there to address other concerns! ",

During our first visit and after examining the current situation of my dad, doctor cleary explained the root cause of the problem and also the kind of treatment along with the tentative tilmelines that will be required to complete the treatment. He spent sufficient enough of time answering all our queries thus reducing our anxiety.  Almost after 2 to 3 sittings, my dad started to feel the reduction in his pain and was relieved to a lot of extent. I would really thank the doctor and his efficient staff for all the help and would recommned him for all the dental issues one has. ",

He told me that Dr. Ajay's clinic is very nice so i came to your clinic for my dental treatment. Usually dental treatment is very expensive and painful.\r\n       Dr. Ajay did my treatment. Dr. Ajay's nature is very nice & staff is very good. The clinic is very clean neat & tidy. I dont want to criticize anybody but few years ago i had visited one dentist in kisan nagar i had problem in my teeth but when i slept on his dental chair i saw the rusted materials and i came out of the clinic and gave some excuse.\r\n\r\nMy Observation\r\n\r\n1. You are having a latest instrument.\r\n2. Your fees are reasonable.\r\n3. For communication you have a very good system by \"Practo\".\r\n4. U have saved my molar tooth from Root Canal Treatment as advised by earlier doctore.\r\n5. Your treatment is painless. Patients are satisfied with ur work.\r\n\r\nThank you \r\n\r\n- Mr. Kanubhai Limbachia\r\n\r\n",

Have been to many dentists before, but what I found amazing about him was that he tried very hard to protect my tooth instead of removing it and comforted me by explaining me in layman's terms. Took almost 11-12 sittings to do the complex treatment of Re-Root Canal, but with his exceptionally adept hands, I am much better now. He is truly the best in this part of Mumbai, highly experienced and qualified. What you'll easily notice is his amicable personality and soft/painless hands. His team is also skilled and well supportive. Would definitely recommend him.",

I had visited Dr Thaker earlier  for my daughter's treatment. He gave us genuine advice and prescribed medicines for me. The next day I was surprised to find out that root canal can be quite a painless procedure. He informs on each and every step and also talks through the procedure. He and his team followed up with me regarding the procedure. I was very happy with the way I was taken care of. So at his clinic you have a skilled professional team of doctors and trained staff.... And a very comfortable satisfying experience.",

With the proficiency the doctor has, my son's root canal process was completed smoothly.  All the supportive staff's are also very nice to us and so do the ambience.

This is just to bring to your knowledge that having stomach upset due to Amoxicillin is not considered to be an allergy. It's a side effect of that drug which can occur to few of the patients.

Such issues can be diagnosed only if you let us know about your problem and report back to us.\n\n We would be glad to help you out of your pain and see to it that you are completely pain free. \n\nRegards, \nDr. Ajay Thaker. \nSmiles Royale Dental Clinic.",

Trust me I wasn't forced to pick a particular plan.\n\nOnce my treatment started, I received calls as well as WhatsApp messages enquiring about my health too.\n\nThe experienced staff at the clinic are also friendly and warm in their approach.\n\nThank you Dr.Ajay for bringing back my smile.",

I did not face any discomfort at any time of the process. The day after the treatment the team called up to check on me regarding how I was doing whether any pain or discomfort experienced. Overall the service is awesome. ",

You were appointed just a day prior in between the 2 already appointed patients just because you had personally requested even though it wasn\u2019t an emergency we accommodated you. \n\n  And there is ought to be a wait time which is difficult to predict in terms of amount of time that is required to complete a particular case considering so many factors like patient\u2019s pain, addressing their fears and whatever queries they may have till their satisfaction levels.\n\n Any treatment given to a patient can\u2019t always be time bound as we are not just treating a tooth/teeth but basically treating their psyche as well !! \n\n So, I would again very humbly request you that if at all there is any wait time at any Doctor\u2019s waiting room rather than getting irritated do try to understand the fact that a Doctor is trying His/her Best to take care of a patient who is in some sort of trouble and there is nothing against anyone else who is in the waiting. But, on the contrary, you should be glad that the Doctor  is so caring that he/she will give you equal attention to your problems when its your turn.\n\n And lastly, let me thank you for providing me an opportunity to genuinely explain my inability to take up patients on time on some occasions as \"Dentistry\" is all about \"Art\" of  not just treating patients but its about treating patients to their levels of  Expectations and Contentment and for that We need to devote good amount of our Time and Energy.  \n  Also, I know for sure that  you too were always glad in this last decade post all your treatments and we never gave you any reason for worry post treatment. One odd day shouldn't change the strong bond that exists. \nGod Bless. \ud83d\ude07",

Pls do not worry and let us know your identity  for us to treat ur pain, if at all it still persists. \n\nRegards,\nDr. Ajay Thaker.",
