"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Implant Rehabilitation,Surgical Tooth Extraction,Zirconia Crowns,Orthotic Splints,",0,0,YES,"I am deeply grateful to Dr. Rinal Modi and her team of experts in Apollo Dental clinic, at Tardeo, Mumbai. 
I had forgotten to smile and they restored my smile by reconstructing my mouth. I had lost all my molars and premolars and continued with this condition, since 2 decades. I was very scared to go to a dentist, specially after being a diabetic. 
I approached Dr. Rinal through a reference. She is very structured, organised, skilled lovely person. I took the decision of continuing the treatement with her in my first consultancy.
Following was the procedure:
Consultancy
After a preliminary thorough oral inspection, she asked me to get a scan dent X ray. She with her team identified the problem and treatement. Then she explained me the entire process and expenses to restore my lost teeth, very patiently answering all my queries and initiated my courage to go forward.
Treatement
Step 1.
First she got all my rudimentary molar fragments extracted painlessly, and waited for the gums to heal properly before next step.
Step 2.
She did the fillings and cleaning required.after a week
Step 3
Then one by one they got totally 7 implants fixed in my mouth in the order
2 lower right, 2 lower left, 2 upper left and 1 upper right, in about three to four sittings. Giving a break of one week or two weeks as the demand of healing.
After all implants were installed, they checked the position by taking xrays, till they were satisfied thoroughly.
Step 4 
They waited for about 6 months.
Then they did the fixing of abutments followed by crowns. The measurements for crowns were taken accurately till they were perfect. Then they fixed the crowns matching the colour shade with my original teeth colour.
The whole process took a year, since i had gone to USA for family visit for about six months, before step 4.
Result
I got my complete set of teeth for healthy living at the age of 60. I got my confidence and smile back. No one thinks they are false teeth. They look so real. I am very comfortable and dont look my age of 60.
All thanks to Dr. Rinal Modi, she is an Angel and her team of Apollo dentists.
God Bless Her and All.
Had it not been for Rinal, i would not have got my teeth back.
