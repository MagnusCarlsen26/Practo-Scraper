Given my last wisdom tooth extraction experience which was quite painful (and with a long recovery time), I was extremely scared and hesitant to get another extraction.

I remember my last experience was harrowing where I was screaming during those shots. 

The overall procedure was fast and absolutely painless, unlike my prior experience in India and Spain. My recovery was super quick and I could resume work immediately. I was highly impressed by Dr. Bhumija's skillset, friendliness, warmth, and the fact she delivered on her promise of a painless experience.
