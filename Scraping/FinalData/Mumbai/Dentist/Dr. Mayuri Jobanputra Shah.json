I am very happy with the entire experience and outcome - the ceramic crowns are of high quality and the RCT treatment has thus far been very effective. ",

Best part about her is that she explained all the issues and what she will be doing in detail.. which really helped with my fear for dentist.. my teeth has never looked healthier!",
