She explained each step of the procedure clearly and made sure I was comfortable throughout the appointment. The teeth cleaning itself was painless and efficient, and I left feeling fresh and confident with my clean teeth.\n\nWhat stood out to me was Dr. Kavitha's attention to detail - she pointed out some areas that needed extra attention and took the time to explain how to improve my oral hygiene at home.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Dr. Kavitha and her clinic to anyone looking for a dentist *** ** ************** gentle, and caring.",
