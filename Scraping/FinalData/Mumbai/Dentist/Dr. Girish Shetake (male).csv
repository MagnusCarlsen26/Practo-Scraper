Have discontinued my treatmemt after two sittings. Won't recommended to anyone.,2021-04-07 05:57:44,False,False,nikhil chavan,"Firstly we apologize if we have offended you in any sense. As I remember you were treated in our 90 feet road clinic setup. Due to current lockdown policies , we cannot give enough time to patient after 7pm . If patient has anatomical difficulties to work inside mouth ,we have to apply few barriers and suction to complete the treatment.  For this we prefer daytime appointment .As u could not manage your appointment during day time, it was difficult for us to give enough consoling time during night appointments. 
Anyways as we have completed the root canal treatment , you can continue your treatment with other dentist . You can contact anytime if you need any case records . We ll be happy to see you in future .
 Again we are sorry to find you on negative side of our feedback portal.
