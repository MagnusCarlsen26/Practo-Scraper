"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Invisible/Clear Braces,",0,0,YES,"My teeth have frontal gaps and are protruding in the front. I had visited Dr Amit in early 2020 to get myself treated. Back then, all I knew that metallic braces were the only method to get better looking teeth. He very patiently explained the different options in braces and a much better alternative of braces i.e aligners. He gave a comparative analysis of all options treatment and cost wise. He also showed me results of some of his patients who had opted for either of the treatments. Due to COVID, my treatment got delayed and started in October 2021. This time I decided to go with aligners. All the procedures done by him and his team before taking models for my aligners, during the treatment and post my aligners were very smooth and easy. There were absolutely zero issues during this whole course which was for 1.4 years.  Right now, I am using retainers and again the process is very well managed.

Dr Amit is a very calm, patient, cooperative individual. He takes each case vey seriously and ensures 100% results along with customer satisfaction.

My mother in so many years has had the best experience of her life when it comes to root canal. Right from examining the tooth, cavity and putting in a new cap everything was done very professionally. Dr Prarthana and Dr Amit are both very humble and help in making their patients feel at ease. They explain the entire stages of treatment and offer you enough support to help you sail through the process smoothly. They conducted a professional examination of my mother’s tooth and recommended her a solution. During the root canal treatment Dr Prarthana has very gentle hands and helps in comforting the patients while the procedure is on. Her hands are more like a feather touch. My mother was very impressed with the kind of treatment she got before, during and post the procedure. Their charges are affordable as well. Not to mention their services are top notch. 
I would highly recommend Dr Amit and Dr Prarthana for your dental solutions.
