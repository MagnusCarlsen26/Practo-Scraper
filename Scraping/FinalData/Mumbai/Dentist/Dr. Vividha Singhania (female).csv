"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,","RCT - Root Canal Treatment,Dental Cleaning,Artificial Teeth,",0,0,YES,"I got to know about Dr. Vividha from couple of my friends who had got their parents treated with the doctor. I wanted to get a full dental checkup done for my parents. My parents hadn't got a dental check up for last 50 years and we discovered whole lot of issues which had hid from me as well. Within 6 months, with various weekly sessions, Dr. Vividha ensured that their set of teeth is worked upon well (root canal, filling, cleaning and fitting new tooth n caps along) so that they do not have any future trouble. The style of doctor's treatment is so warm and personalized that patients need not worry even a bit about pain or stress within treatment. And after a couple of conversations with doctor, one feels as if we have known the doctor for long. That's an immaculate quality all doctors should have.  My parents do not have any dental issues anymore and do a 6 monthly visit check with Dr. Vividha. 
And 4 months back, I had personally visited for root canal and tooth breakage. Dr. Vividha was very accommodating with timing as I have erratic work timing and also I am scared of any procedures with needles or tools.  Was really happy that my procedures were done in 3 sittings and the doctor made me comfortable to ensure i do not panic, going to the extent of playing old bollywood songs I like.  And yes, the pain was hardly a bit after anesthesia wore off.  I have learnt my lesson on  dental hygiene with half yearly visits scheduled to the dentist. I highly recommend Dr. Vividha  to dental patients of all ages. Dr. Vividha will recommend the right treatment and make sure the issues are corrected for good.
