I particularly am super scared of needles and pointy objects, and they always go out of their way to ensure I'm okay. They gave me an extremely appropriate diagnosis the very first time I visited and my treatment has been going smoothly ever since. I had an extraction a couple of weeks ago, I must say it was done so well, that even after the anaesthesia wore off I didn't feel any discomfort. The Gandhis give extreme importance to the comfort of patients be it for even the smallest of procedures, and that's beyond amazing. They will never rush you, its always effortless.",

They gave me an extremely appropriate diagnosis the very first time I visited and my treatment has been going smoothly ever since. I had an extraction a couple of weeks ago, I must say it was done so well, that even after the anaesthesia wore off I didn't feel any discomfort. The Gandhis give extreme importance to the comfort of patients be it for even the smallest of procedures, and that's beyond amazing. They will never rush you, its always effortless.",
