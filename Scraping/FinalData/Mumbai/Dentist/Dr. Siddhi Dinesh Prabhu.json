I was certain that the tooth would need to be extracted, but Dr. Siddhi at Shubhdin dental clinic was willing to take the time to assess the situation and recommend the best course of action.\n\nDr. Siddhi was incredibly patient and skilled, performing a re-root canal procedure that saved my tooth from being extracted. I was amazed at the level of care and attention to detail that he provided, and the results were remarkable. My tooth infection was completely cured, I no longer have any pain and my tooth is functional again! \n\nThe clinic itself is impeccably clean and hygienic, and the staff are all very friendly and welcoming. The services offered here are also very reasonably priced considering the high-quality care that is provided.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Shubhdin dental clinic to anyone in need of dental care. Dr. Siddhi is a true professional who takes the time to understand his patients' needs and provides exceptional care. Thank you to the entire team at Shubhdin dental clinic for making my experience a positive one!",

I was certain that the tooth would need to be extracted, but Dr. Siddhi at Shubhdin dental clinic was willing to take the time to assess the situation and recommend the best course of action.\n\nDr. Siddhi was incredibly patient and skilled, performing a re-root canal procedure that saved my tooth from being extracted. I was amazed at the level of care and attention to detail that he provided, and the results were remarkable. My tooth infection was completely cured, I no longer have any pain and my tooth is functional again! \n\nThe clinic itself is impeccably clean and hygienic, and the staff are all very friendly and welcoming. The services offered here are also very reasonably priced considering the high-quality care that is provided.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Shubhdin dental clinic to anyone in need of dental care. Dr. Siddhi is a true professional who takes the time to understand his patients' needs and provides exceptional care. Thank you to the entire team at Shubhdin dental clinic for making my experience a positive one!",

Unfortunately due to some health issue in the Crawford market I unconscious fell down on thefootpath and my front tooth got uprooted and one tooth broke at the middle. By God's grace I came to Dr. Siddhi Prabhu and he after 5 hours reimplanted my original uprooted teeth and did root canal and capping of the broken one. At 9:00 pm doctor took out extra time for me out of his busy schedule, he did the procedures very smoothly without any pain even if it was a tricky and difficult task. His staff was very helpful and even if the chances of reimplanted tooth to survive was very very less but fortunately after 1 month it is alive and fine. All thanks to Dr. Siddhi Prabhu and staff. They made this difficult procedure successful. ",
