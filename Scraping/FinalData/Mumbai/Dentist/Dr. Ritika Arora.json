From the moment I entered the Aesthetic Smile Dental Clinic I was introduced to Dr Ritika Arora. My 1st impression was the cleanliness and the fitoutis modern with the latest technology & dental equipment. Her professional approach together with her overwhelming credentials made me feel at ease immediately. She explained the complete process from start to finish from the moment you arrive in India till the day you depart. She will then sit down and explain the complete treatment plan and the costs involved so that there are no hidden surprises. Not many clinics have this credential. My mother will get her treatment  in August and I have no hesitation that this will be a great success. If you are considering dental treatment abroad then this clinic has to on top of your priority list. You may be surprised how affordable it is. ",

But this time I was not really happy as I wanted to clean my teeth which was done but the teeth polishing was not done and also I was charged 1800rs which I feel is too expensive for cleaning of teeth and no polishing as far as I remember the last time I paid was 500 Rs and Dr Ritika was really professional with explaining in details of my dental health. I hope you discuss the charges before hand so patient are mentally prepared . ",

I stay around 20Kms away from clinic and travelling so far in Mumbai for treatment was worthwhile once I visited the doctor. I had a bad smile due to front broken tooth and with her expertise doctor suggested the right treatment , cleared my doubt and fixed my smile.\n\n\nWas very happy and satisfied with her work. Very good ambience at the clinic and good hygiene maintained. Felt comfortable taking the treatment without any hassels. I would recommend her for all your dental issues.",

I'm first appointment was with Dr Ritika , and she made me feel so calm and comfortable and convinced me start my treatment. I had to get couple of root canals, caps and some tooth extraction, bridges .. she went step by step making sure the treatment was pain-free. Her team is wonderful too. Finally today I walked out with a healthy mouth wit the promise that I will see her every 6 months Once again thank you Dr Ritika for getting the dental fear out So if you one of them whos scared of dentist , then you know who to visit Aesthetic smiles .. one is the best dental clinics in Mumbai\n",

From the moment I entered the Aesthetic Smile Dental Clinic I was introduced to Dr Ritika Arora. My 1st impression was the cleanliness and the fitoutis modern with the latest technology & dental equipment. Her professional approach together with her overwhelming credentials made me feel at ease immediately. She explained the complete process from start to finish from the moment you arrive in India till the day you depart. She will then sit down and explain the complete treatment plan and the costs involved so that there are no hidden surprises. Not many clinics have this credential. My mother will get her treatment  in August and I have no hesitation that this will be a great success. If you are considering dental treatment abroad then this clinic has to on top of your priority list. You may be surprised how affordable it is. ",

I was skeptical at start since I didn't knew about Dr. Ritika and read only the reviews on Practo and decided to make a visit. I stay around 20Kms away from clinic and travelling so far in Mumbai for treatment was worthwhile once I visited the doctor. I had a bad smile due to front broken tooth and with her expertise doctor suggested the right treatment , cleared my doubt and fixed my smile.\n\n\nWas very happy and satisfied with her work. Very good ambience at the clinic and good hygiene maintained. Felt comfortable taking the treatment without any hassels. I would recommend her for all your dental issues.",

I'm first appointment was with Dr Ritika , and she made me feel so calm and comfortable and convinced me start my treatment. I had to get couple of root canals, caps and some tooth extraction, bridges .. she went step by step making sure the treatment was pain-free. Her team is wonderful too. Finally today I walked out with a healthy mouth wit the promise that I will see her every 6 months Once again thank you Dr Ritika for getting the dental fear out So if you one of them whos scared of dentist , then you know who to visit Aesthetic smiles .. one is the best dental clinics in Mumbai\n",

She was flexible with dates and times and explained all my options clearly (and her English is exceptional). She and her surgeon ended up doing several implants that I have needed for some time because her costs are so reasonable compared to the US. She didn't just hand me of to the surgeon--she stayed with me during the procedure and participated. She gave me her contact info and she followed up with me several times over the course of the next 2 days and squeezed in a follow-up visit before I left the country. Her concern was genuinely felt and it was clear I was in good hands. I'm coming back in 6 months to finish the implants process. I highly recommend her!",
