As for the cost is affordable (although relatively more than the traditional braces that take more time).\n\nMy experience- It took me 2 days initially to get used to the wearing and removal of aligners. Every new aligner was slightly discomforting and painful (bearable pain) for 3 days after that it would be comfortable to wear. I wore the first 25 aligners for 15 days each and the remaining each for a week. I personally think that, the initial discomfort is definitely less compared to the traditional braces. And after 25 aligners I was very much used to the aligners.\n\nMy experience with Dr Keyur Shah-\n\nHe is amazing. He explained each step very well and is very gentle and patient with his work.\n\nMy experience with Dr Shagun Mehta- \n \nI had my cavity tooth fillings/restoration and wisdom tooth extraction treated by her. She too is very patient, gentle and quick with her work. [P.S It took 5 mins for her to get the wisdom tooth extracted ;) ]\n\nMy overall experience and special story- \nMy wisdom tooth was decayed to the point it reached to the nerve and was very painful, and I had to get it extracted immediately. As it was Ramazan so I could get it treated later in the evening only, both Dr Keyur Shah and Dr Shagun Mehta were very considerate and accommodative to schedule the same for me post fast and were very patient though I reached super late and also allowed me sometime to eat/drink/open my fast before starting the treatment.\n\nI highly recommend Embrace Orthodontics Khar, Dr Keyur Shah and Dr Shagun Mehta for anyone who wants to get the orthodontist treatment in lesser time, Please note that the treatment plan is subjective based on individual\u2019s compliance and bone movement. \n\nThank you Dr Keyur Shah and Dr Shagun Mehta :)\nYou guys are great at your work\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f",

I am in my mid-thirties and made the decision to go for teeth straightening and Dr Keyur suggested to go with Lingual Braces( Fixed on Inner surface of teeth). I am really thankful to him for this suggestion to go with that treatment. The bracing work is so perfect that none of my colleagues notice or know that I am having braces and these did align my teeths within a year. Throughout the treatment I didn't face any dental or speech problems and also he was very supportive in my very busy travel schedule. I would recommend him for your better smile \ud83d\ude03.     \n ",

As for the cost is affordable (although relatively more than the traditional braces that take more time).\n\nMy experience- It took me 2 days initially to get used to the wearing and removal of aligners. Every new aligner was slightly discomforting and painful (bearable pain) for 3 days after that it would be comfortable to wear. I wore the first 25 aligners for 15 days each and the remaining each for a week. I personally think that, the initial discomfort is definitely less compared to the traditional braces. And after 25 aligners I was very much used to the aligners.\n\nMy experience with Dr Keyur Shah-\n\nHe is amazing. He explained each step very well and is very gentle and patient with his work.\n\nMy experience with Dr Shagun Mehta- \n \nI had my cavity tooth fillings/restoration and wisdom tooth extraction treated by her. She too is very patient, gentle and quick with her work. [P.S It took 5 mins for her to get the wisdom tooth extracted ;) ]\n\nMy overall experience and special story- \nMy wisdom tooth was decayed to the point it reached to the nerve and was very painful, and I had to get it extracted immediately. As it was Ramazan so I could get it treated later in the evening only, both Dr Keyur Shah and Dr Shagun Mehta were very considerate and accommodative to schedule the same for me post fast and were very patient though I reached super late and also allowed me sometime to eat/drink/open my fast before starting the treatment.\n\nI highly recommend Embrace Orthodontics Khar, Dr Keyur Shah and Dr Shagun Mehta for anyone who wants to get the orthodontist treatment in lesser time, Please note that the treatment plan is subjective based on individual\u2019s compliance and bone movement. \n\nThank you Dr Keyur Shah and Dr Shagun Mehta :)\nYou guys are great at your work\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f",

I am in my mid-thirties and made the decision to go for teeth straightening and Dr Keyur suggested to go with Lingual Braces( Fixed on Inner surface of teeth). I am really thankful to him for this suggestion to go with that treatment. The bracing work is so perfect that none of my colleagues notice or know that I am having braces and these did align my teeths within a year. Throughout the treatment I didn't face any dental or speech problems and also he was very supportive in my very busy travel schedule. I would recommend him for your better smile \ud83d\ude03.     \n ",
