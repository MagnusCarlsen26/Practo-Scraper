It was one of the complicated cases because the tooth was almost completely inside the jaw. Doctor Ashwini advised to get the oral surgery done. The appointment was scheduled swiftly as per mutual convenience.\n\nDuring extraction, as it was a complicated case, I experienced some pain but she handled it well by timing the process calmly, kept talking and gave anesthesia to smoothen the pain. She called to her clinic for follow-up next morning, two days after it and one week later to remove the stitches. All of the meetings happened at the scheduled time professionally. She ensured through regular followups that recovery is going as per her expectations. She also gave medicine so that swelling was almost non-observable. There was not a single day of discomfort or pain post surgery and I could eat EVERYTHING from second day of surgery. Doctor Ashwini is a pleasant and professional doctor which makes you trust her capabilities well.\n\nThe only minor glitch in the entire process is that on my first appointment when I reached the clinic, I came to know doctor was out of town. To makeup for the same, Doctor Ashwini accommodated me next day as per my convenience even though her schedule was full. PRACTO Team (if you are reading this), you need to work on coordination with doctor's schedule.\n\nI would strongly recommend the doctor for your dental qualms, specially Wisdom tooth.",

It was one of the complicated cases because the tooth was almost completely inside the jaw. Doctor Ashwini advised to get the oral surgery done. The appointment was scheduled swiftly as per mutual convenience.\n\nDuring extraction, as it was a complicated case, I experienced some pain but she handled it well by timing the process calmly, kept talking and gave anesthesia to smoothen the pain. She called to her clinic for follow-up next morning, two days after it and one week later to remove the stitches. All of the meetings happened at the scheduled time professionally. She ensured through regular followups that recovery is going as per her expectations. She also gave medicine so that swelling was almost non-observable. There was not a single day of discomfort or pain post surgery and I could eat EVERYTHING from second day of surgery. Doctor Ashwini is a pleasant and professional doctor which makes you trust her capabilities well.\n\nThe only minor glitch in the entire process is that on my first appointment when I reached the clinic, I came to know doctor was out of town. To makeup for the same, Doctor Ashwini accommodated me next day as per my convenience even though her schedule was full. PRACTO Team (if you are reading this), you need to work on coordination with doctor's schedule.\n\nI would strongly recommend the doctor for your dental qualms, specially Wisdom tooth.",

Placement of the zirconia crown on the affected tooth was done perfectly by her. I would definitely recommend her for root canal treatment as every tooth of ours is worth a lot so you need to go to a really good dentist to save it.  Dr Manasi Gurnani is definitely that dentist.",

I wish they would care to call and inform the patient that they are running late (which is understandable). \r\n\r\nFor the good parts, my treatment was extremely good in terms of pre, during and post the tooth extraction, and pretty painless! The clinic has a cheerful vibe to it which is extremely soothing. Not once did i be reminded of Ogden Nash's \"This is gonna hurt just a lil bit\". Good work Wisdom Tooth Clinic! ",

And decided to remove 2 of moms teeth in 1 appointment in 45 minutes. \n\nThe dentist was rushed & not gentle during the procedure resulting in pain afterwards. No post operative care instructions were given either. I had to ask if antibiotics have to be given, diet or ice to be used.\nMy mom had terrible pain for 2 weeks afterwards. The dentist should have known better to not remove 2 teeth at the same time for an 85 year old.\n\nAnd to top it all the dentist charged us 10,000 ( i.e 5000 Rs per tooth for a simple extraction).  Other dentists were charging 2000 per tooth for extraction around the same time.\nThe dentist has no right to do this to anyone. ",

On online review, Dr. Ashwini's name popped up and I somehow intuitively felt that she was the right person to go to. And yes, I was right. I felt at ease right from the first moment I spoke to her. She  is extremely proficient in her work and also very caring towards her patients. The clinic setting is very relaxed and comfortable. I passed the surgical procedure like a breeze... with no operative or post-operative pain and quick recovery. I would highly recommend her.",

Like others I was also lost in a jungle with so many options to consider. Went ahead to DR. Ashwini because of the recommendations I saw on Practo but still having a feeling going on in my mind that what worst gonna happen in my case.I was a bit overwhelmed by doctor's response. Not only she did a commendable job in the surgery that I felt pinch by cactus twice. Overall it turned out to be a soothing experience rather than hell. Although the surgery was on a bit expensive side but who would take risk with their tooth. I most likely will pay a visit to Ashwini for my tooth problems if it happens in near future. I recommend her to everyone because she knows how to get the job done with very minimal pain which brings a sigh of relief and smile on your face.",
