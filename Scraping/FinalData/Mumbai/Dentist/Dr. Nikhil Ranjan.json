The clinic is hygienic with ultra modern tools and practices. There were frequent check ins by the doctor to know the pain situation and the process of healing. It took me 5 months for the whole treatment and not even once I felt that i should take a second opinion. Hard to find a dentist who can make dental procedures nearly painless.",
