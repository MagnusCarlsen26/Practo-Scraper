Dr. Sharin explained me the root cause of the hyperpigmentation in detail and used all the medications as per my skin type. The whole process was very smooth and doctor took time in-between to thoroughly explain me the entire process and the medication she was applying on my face. Post treatment, the instructions were crisp and clear in terms of the daily routine I need follow so that the same issue doesn\u2019t arise again. The moisturiser, de pigmentation cream and sunscreen were all prescribed according to my skin type. The regular follow up by the doctor and her team was absolutely amazing. I am very happy with Dr. Sharin\u2019s professionalism * ********** All my queries were answered politely and patiently pre and post treatment. She and her team were available round the clock for any queries. I have visited many other facial aesthetic clinics but I would say nothing beats the experience I had at Skulpt Facial Aesthetic, Dental & Implant Clinic. I would highly recommend for all facial and dental needs!",

Dr. Sharin explained me the root cause of the hyperpigmentation in detail and used all the medications as per my skin type. The whole process was very smooth and doctor took time in-between to thoroughly explain me the entire process and the medication she was applying on my face. Post treatment, the instructions were crisp and clear in terms of the daily routine I need follow so that the same issue doesn\u2019t arise again. The moisturiser, de pigmentation cream and sunscreen were all prescribed according to my skin type. The regular follow up by the doctor and her team was absolutely amazing. I am very happy with Dr. Sharin\u2019s professionalism * ********** All my queries were answered politely and patiently pre and post treatment. She and her team were available round the clock for any queries. I have visited many other facial aesthetic clinics but I would say nothing beats the experience I had at Skulpt Facial Aesthetic, Dental & Implant Clinic. I would highly recommend for all facial and dental needs!",
