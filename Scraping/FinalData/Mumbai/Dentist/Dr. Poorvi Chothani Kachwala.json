All my previous dental experiences from my childhood to a horrendous one two years ago, were seriously bad. Then I walked into Doctor's Poorvi's clinic with a good amount of skepticism and fear. What happened next, almost changed my life. First, I got a very astute explanation of why my dental experiences were bad till now. I got a good idea of how my teeth issues can be dealt with. And, then subsequently the treatment of that dreaded root canal began. I was a bit of a cry baby, but props to the doc who treated me with stoic patience, made the procedure as painless as possible, for a decay case as horrible as mine. \nNow, finally, a dentist doesn't sound like a scary person you don't want to visit. In fact I am looking forward to getting every tooth issue fixed in the coming time. \nSo, Thank you doc!",

She provides realistic options as well as advice. I was quite scared to visit a clinic due to ongoing pandemic, however, enough precautions are being taken at the clinic to ensure that infection is not spread. \nWould highly recommend her !! ",

Also the materials she uses are of a very high standard. \n\nA BIG THANKs to Dr Poorvi and her team!!! You guys are amazing and if I ever have any dental issues I would prefer flying from Australia and seeing you rather than getting my dental work done in australia.",

All my previous dental experiences from my childhood to a horrendous one two years ago, were seriously bad. Then I walked into Doctor's Poorvi's clinic with a good amount of skepticism and fear. What happened next, almost changed my life. First, I got a very astute explanation of why my dental experiences were bad till now. I got a good idea of how my teeth issues can be dealt with. And, then subsequently the treatment of that dreaded root canal began. I was a bit of a cry baby, but props to the doc who treated me with stoic patience, made the procedure as painless as possible, for a decay case as horrible as mine. \nNow, finally, a dentist doesn't sound like a scary person you don't want to visit. In fact I am looking forward to getting every tooth issue fixed in the coming time. \nSo, Thank you doc!",

I visited her for a cavity filling a couple of years back and for RCT recently. She knows her craft. She is so good that treatment like RCT was not painful at all. She provides realistic options as well as advice. I was quite scared to visit a clinic due to ongoing pandemic, however, enough precautions are being taken at the clinic to ensure that infection is not spread. \nWould highly recommend her !! ",

Also the materials she uses are of a very high standard. \n\nA BIG THANKs to Dr Poorvi and her team!!! You guys are amazing and if I ever have any dental issues I would prefer flying from Australia and seeing you rather than getting my dental work done in australia.",

                "review_text": "Basically I was suffering from  my tooth issue since a fortnight,My old doctor is out of town and I was referred to This doctor(her name Dr.Poorvi)by my cousin,since Her clinic is located right near my house near D.N.Nagar,Andheri.I was given the appointment and I was amazed to see the clinic set up..It's one of the most modern clinic I thought.. and far superior to my regular dentist's clinical set-up.There was no waiting  as Doctor immediately called me inside,After occupying the chair,She asked few basic question about the pain and the last treatment etc..etc..And I could never realise when the treatment began and when it got over!!I thought it was pretty personalized treatment  and the ease &comfort with this Doctor started treatment,I was really pleasantly surprised,as Invariably my  experience with the dentist  is HORRIBLE!! Anyway,She used one laser instrument,while I was curious to understand the mechanics and the advantages of the same,Without the slightest hesitation, she explained the purpose of some of the most modern instrument...I would rank my experience as Marvelous!!With the young mind working so proficiently...It was superb.I have taken another appointment on 9th Dec.\r\nEXCELLENT!!",

I decided to go ahead n here I am I love  my smile \nThe procedure was painless. She made minor corrections in my teeth too and bleached them. Never  knew I could have a such an amazing smile. \nDr. Poorvi and her work is second to none. I am her permanent patient. ",

The cavity job done on 2 teeth doesn't feel like it has been ever touched. I can't even feel any difference, that well a job Dr. Poorvi has dome.
