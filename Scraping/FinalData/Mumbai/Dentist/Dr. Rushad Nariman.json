I googled for good dentists in and around malad and came across Dr. Rushad and I am so relieved and happy to have found him. A truly humble, honest, patient and soft spoken doctor who excels in his work. I thank him and his entire team from the bottom of my heart for being so patient with me and making my entire dental experience so comfortable and painless.\nI also got 2 of my wisdom tooth extracted which was a surgical process. I must say that he and his co-doctor took all the efforts and care to ensure that it doesn't pain at all and it didn't.\nEverytime he treats you, he does a regular follow up to check if there is any pain or discomfort after the treatment which gives you such a warm and comforting feeling.\nThank you Dr. Nariman for bearing me, being so patient with me and giving the best dental treatment.\nI will highly recommend him for every dental treatment.\nWish you all the very best!!",

I was having multiple problems in my teeth having cavities in either side, foods were getting stuck up giving a lot of inconvenience and many a times lot of pain in my teeth. I had consulted other doctors as well before coming to Dr. Rushad. What I perceived from all these meetings that I will have to go for full mouth rehabilitation. I talked to Dr. Rushad on this line. He helped me understand all the scenarios. Truly speaking, I was a little bit apprehensive also as a fair amount of money was required for this treatment. Anyway, I could prepare myself for this treatment. One more thing, I had to stick to a deadline for this procedure to be completed on or before. At the first instance, Dr. Rushad told me that this is not possible within the timeline I had given. But after 2 or 3 days, he called me in the evening and told he will try his best and really he tried his best and could finish everything perfectly on time. Now, I am quite happy that now I can chew, eat and of course show my beautiful teeth with perfect smile. God bless him as he has really rendered his services with perfect professionalism and personal touch.",

He gave me medicines for 3 days but I was feeling good after 2 days only. He would not rush even if other patients are waiting. He gives all the time required for the patient to feel comfortable. His treatment is the best as compared to all the dentists I have met till date. After this, I also did my teeth cleaning from him which was again a very good experience. \n\nMy mother got her dentures done from him. He explained the process in detail initially which not all doctors do in so much of detail. He then successfully completed the treatment as per the plan given by him. The dentures are fitted very nicely and my mother has no pain. He does regular follow up to ask about any other pain / skin issues that happens due to the dentures. He tells us to visit him and not bear any pain. His patients don't have to wait because he always reaches his clinic before the appointment time. \n\nSeeing this, even my bua went to her for her dentures which were not fixing properly (given and prepared by other dentist). And even she is happy with his treatment and with the way he treats his patients.\n \nA big Thank you to Dr. Nariman for giving us *** **** dental treatment. May god bless you and you become the most successful Dentist.\n\nI highly recommend him for every dental treatment.",

Dr. Nariman also provided the best caps for the affected teeth as quickly as possible. His work is so impeccable that the caps looks just like the real adjacent tooth. My mom is now pain-free and flashes a confident smile, all thanks to Dr. Nariman. \n",

A truly humble, honest, patient and soft spoken doctor who excels in his work. I thank him and his entire team from the bottom of my heart for being so patient with me and making my entire dental experience so comfortable and painless.\nI also got 2 of my wisdom tooth extracted which was a surgical process. I must say that he and his co-doctor took all the efforts and care to ensure that it doesn't pain at all and it didn't.\nEverytime he treats you, he does a regular follow up to check if there is any pain or discomfort after the treatment which gives you such a warm and comforting feeling.\nThank you Dr. Nariman for bearing me, being so patient with me and giving the best dental treatment.\nI will highly recommend him for every dental treatment.\nWish you all the very best!!",

I was having multiple problems in my teeth having cavities in either side, foods were getting stuck up giving a lot of inconvenience and many a times lot of pain in my teeth. I had consulted other doctors as well before coming to Dr. Rushad. What I perceived from all these meetings that I will have to go for full mouth rehabilitation. I talked to Dr. Rushad on this line. He helped me understand all the scenarios. Truly speaking, I was a little bit apprehensive also as a fair amount of money was required for this treatment. Anyway, I could prepare myself for this treatment. One more thing, I had to stick to a deadline for this procedure to be completed on or before. At the first instance, Dr. Rushad told me that this is not possible within the timeline I had given. But after 2 or 3 days, he called me in the evening and told he will try his best and really he tried his best and could finish everything perfectly on time. Now, I am quite happy that now I can chew, eat and of course show my beautiful teeth with perfect smile. God bless him as he has really rendered his services with perfect professionalism and personal touch.",

He gave me medicines for 3 days but I was feeling good after 2 days only. He would not rush even if other patients are waiting. He gives all the time required for the patient to feel comfortable. His treatment is the best as compared to all the dentists I have met till date. After this, I also did my teeth cleaning from him which was again a very good experience. \n\nMy mother got her dentures done from him. He explained the process in detail initially which not all doctors do in so much of detail. He then successfully completed the treatment as per the plan given by him. The dentures are fitted very nicely and my mother has no pain. He does regular follow up to ask about any other pain / skin issues that happens due to the dentures. He tells us to visit him and not bear any pain. His patients don't have to wait because he always reaches his clinic before the appointment time. \n\nSeeing this, even my bua went to her for her dentures which were not fixing properly (given and prepared by other dentist). And even she is happy with his treatment and with the way he treats his patients.\n \nA big Thank you to Dr. Nariman for giving us *** **** dental treatment. May god bless you and you become the most successful Dentist.\n\nI highly recommend him for every dental treatment.",

Dr. Nariman also provided the best caps for the affected teeth as quickly as possible. His work is so impeccable that the caps looks just like the real adjacent tooth. My mom is now pain-free and flashes a confident smile, all thanks to Dr. Nariman. \n",
