While it is common in Mumbai that despite taking an appointment in advance people have to just arrive at the clinic and still take numbers causing a pile up of patients, *that was not the case here. If you take an appointment at 10 am they will be ready to see you at exactly 10 am*. \nEverything is systematic and planned as a clinic should be. During the checkup the doctor took their time to throughly examine me during which they also took photographs of my upper and lower jaw,  the session did not end there and after the checkup we were then seated in the doctor's cabin where they told me about the general health of my teeth and how i could improve upon it with the reference of the photographs that they had just taken, it is very rare to see a doctor take so much effort and time to explain their diagnosis. They know about the latest treatments  and have the latest instruments and equipments readily available to them at their clinic. I have always had two milk teeth in the front of my lower jaw that no dentist had ever bothered about, these milk teeth had caused the rest of my teeth to get misaligned and had resulted in me developing a crossbite and had just begun chipping away at one of the tooth in my lower jaw , something none of the other dentists i had visited had ever bothered to tell me. A problem is only a problem if it has a solution. Having never had a solution to my milk teeth they had never been a problem to me but just general check up with the doctor and she had recognized the problem and given me the solution in the form of aligners (more precise and almost invisible compared to braces) that they had recommended. Needless to say i was already impressed and decided to go forward with getting the aligners. \nIts been over a year that i have used these aligners and my teeth and jaw are now noticeably more correctly aligned with each other. Over that period i have visited them around 5 or 6 times for a follow up and every visit has been as impressive as my first, very efficient and informative. Keep up the great work.",

While it is common in Mumbai that despite taking an appointment in advance people have to just arrive at the clinic and still take numbers causing a pile up of patients, *that was not the case here. If you take an appointment at 10 am they will be ready to see you at exactly 10 am*. \nEverything is systematic and planned as a clinic should be. During the checkup the doctor took their time to throughly examine me during which they also took photographs of my upper and lower jaw,  the session did not end there and after the checkup we were then seated in the doctor's cabin where they told me about the general health of my teeth and how i could improve upon it with the reference of the photographs that they had just taken, it is very rare to see a doctor take so much effort and time to explain their diagnosis. They know about the latest treatments  and have the latest instruments and equipments readily available to them at their clinic. I have always had two milk teeth in the front of my lower jaw that no dentist had ever bothered about, these milk teeth had caused the rest of my teeth to get misaligned and had resulted in me developing a crossbite and had just begun chipping away at one of the tooth in my lower jaw , something none of the other dentists i had visited had ever bothered to tell me. A problem is only a problem if it has a solution. Having never had a solution to my milk teeth they had never been a problem to me but just general check up with the doctor and she had recognized the problem and given me the solution in the form of aligners (more precise and almost invisible compared to braces) that they had recommended. Needless to say i was already impressed and decided to go forward with getting the aligners. \nIts been over a year that i have used these aligners and my teeth and jaw are now noticeably more correctly aligned with each other. Over that period i have visited them around 5 or 6 times for a follow up and every visit has been as impressive as my first, very efficient and informative. Keep up the great work.",
