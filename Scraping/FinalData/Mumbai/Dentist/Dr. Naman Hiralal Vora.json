I was very uncomfortable with it for several years. I knew that putting braces could be an option however I was not comfortable with the braces either.. was concerned about how I would look with it..\n\n \n\nI came to know about Dr. Vora\u2019s clinic when I was searching for braces treatment on internet. It was one of the options I checked. When I met Dr. Naman Vora first time, he took all my worries away. He explained me the different treatments they had to fix my dental problem. He advised me to go for lingual braces treatment which was perfect for me since the braces are fixed to the back of your teeth and they are not visible while you talk or smile.\n\n \n\nCost of the treatment:\n\nBefore visiting Dr. Vora\u2019s clinic I had visited few more doctors and understood various treatments available. The cost of the treatment at Dr. Vora\u2019s clinic was the lowest among all the clinics I visited. But the quality of treatment was not compromised at all..\n\n \n\n***** *** ***** ********* ***** ** ** ** ****** *** ************* ** *** ****** *** ***** **** ** he is very nice human being, very friendly and caring person. It happens (perhaps with many of us) that when you talk to your doctor, half of your problems go away. With Dr. Naman I have strongly experienced this right from my first visit. He made me very comfortable, all of my queries were addressed properly every time.\n\n \n\nResults of treatment:\n\nIt will not be an exaggeration if I say that this treatment has changed my life. My confidence level used to be low because of the big gap between front row teeth. I had never thought that with the braces treatment the gaps can be completely closed. The results were visible from 1st or 2nd week of treatment only and obviously I was very happy and excited to see that. After my treatment was over I changed my job also and moved to technical sales where I had to visit customers, travel, make presentations. I am sure, without this treatment I would not have been comfortable and confident to visit different people, make presentations etc. The treatment brought lot of positive changes in my life and this magic was done by Dr. Naman.\n\n \n\nI am truly grateful to Dr. Naman Vora..

Upon my visit, I was positively surprised with the safety arrangements in light of covid - specially designed dress,  mouth wash and other aspects. Dr. Darshan saw my x-ray and did physical examination with utmost care. He then recommended for molar extractions, deep cleaning and smile design (only if I wanted to get rid of the stained teeth). My treatment plan was explained to me in a detailed and transparent manner. Post that I visited the clinic 4-5 times for different treatment and each treatment was done by the specialist of that area. I must say that my experience with each of the Doctors was simply amazing. Beside good doctors, they were extremely humane and polite in the behavior. They explained everything before they actually did the same. The devices and equipments used were all best in class. What I liked the most about the treatment was that all the three doctors who were working on my case were completely in sync and each of them knew what other has done..and ensured that long-term solution is provided to me for my dental care. Also, I was constantly contacted by Dr. Darshan himself to check how I was doing.

I was very uncomfortable with it for several years. I knew that putting braces could be an option however I was not comfortable with the braces either.. was concerned about how I would look with it..\n\n \n\nI came to know about Dr. Vora\u2019s clinic when I was searching for braces treatment on internet. It was one of the options I checked. When I met Dr. Naman Vora first time, he took all my worries away. He explained me the different treatments they had to fix my dental problem. He advised me to go for lingual braces treatment which was perfect for me since the braces are fixed to the back of your teeth and they are not visible while you talk or smile.\n\n \n\nCost of the treatment:\n\nBefore visiting Dr. Vora\u2019s clinic I had visited few more doctors and understood various treatments available. The cost of the treatment at Dr. Vora\u2019s clinic was the lowest among all the clinics I visited. But the quality of treatment was not compromised at all..\n\n \n\n***** *** ***** ********* ***** ** ** ** ****** *** ************* ** *** ****** *** ***** **** ** he is very nice human being, very friendly and caring person. It happens (perhaps with many of us) that when you talk to your doctor, half of your problems go away. With Dr. Naman I have strongly experienced this right from my first visit. He made me very comfortable, all of my queries were addressed properly every time.\n\n \n\nResults of treatment:\n\nIt will not be an exaggeration if I say that this treatment has changed my life. My confidence level used to be low because of the big gap between front row teeth. I had never thought that with the braces treatment the gaps can be completely closed. The results were visible from 1st or 2nd week of treatment only and obviously I was very happy and excited to see that. After my treatment was over I changed my job also and moved to technical sales where I had to visit customers, travel, make presentations. I am sure, without this treatment I would not have been comfortable and confident to visit different people, make presentations etc. The treatment brought lot of positive changes in my life and this magic was done by Dr. Naman.\n\n \n\nI am truly grateful to Dr. Naman Vora..

The personalized care and attention to detail I've experienced throughout the treatment journey have been nothing short of remarkable.\n\nYour professionalism, coupled with the welcoming atmosphere of your practice, has made each visit a positive and reassuring experience.

I will gladly recommend your services to others seeking top-notch dental care.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nPranali Sawant",

The two ladies handling the reception services r so apt for their job, have never seen such professionalism in any of the other clinics/hospital I visited earlier.

Upon my visit, I was positively surprised with the safety arrangements in light of covid - specially designed dress,  mouth wash and other aspects. Dr. Darshan saw my x-ray and did physical examination with utmost care. He then recommended for molar extractions, deep cleaning and smile design (only if I wanted to get rid of the stained teeth). My treatment plan was explained to me in a detailed and transparent manner. Post that I visited the clinic 4-5 times for different treatment and each treatment was done by the specialist of that area. I must say that my experience with each of the Doctors was simply amazing. Beside good doctors, they were extremely humane and polite in the behavior. They explained everything before they actually did the same. The devices and equipments used were all best in class. What I liked the most about the treatment was that all the three doctors who were working on my case were completely in sync and each of them knew what other has done..and ensured that long-term solution is provided to me for my dental care. Also, I was constantly contacted by Dr. Darshan himself to check how I was doing.

He took out time to show results from his past successful similar cases of Braces. And explained all the modern options of treatment available. Ranging from cost efficient ones to best aesthetics wise. He also gives you a clear picture of how long your treatment might last and it's expected result outcomes. To sum it up, i would definitely recommend you guys to go to him.",
