"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,Treatment satisfaction,Value for money,Wait time,","Wisdom Tooth Extraction,Maxillo Facial Treatment,",0,0,YES,"Dr. Rajesh Shetty is a wonderful person; ****** ******* *** professional. 
Moreover the entire ambience and the demeanor of the doctor and the staff reverberates positivity.
On the very first day Dr. Shetty patiently heard me out and gave an overview of the line of treatment. The best part was that he addressed the problems which I was facing and did not try to add on anything extra into the treatment.
All the scans and x-rays were done on the same day for the Doctor's perusal.
Within a day I received a call from the Doctor wherein he gave a detailed insight about how they were planning on going ahead with the procedure and the estimate on the cost involved.
Since it was a surgical procedure, involving extraction of all 4 wisdom teeth and previously affixed titanium plates (i had undergone an orthognathic surgery a few years ago) i was given a detailed overview of the same. 
In fact the Doctor was kind enough to let me choose between General Anaesthesia or Local Anesthesia depending on my preference.
Once the day of the surgery was decided, i received  confirmatory calls/messages from the clinic.
On the day of the surgery, the Doctor was very reassuring and ensured that I was comfortable, especially since I had opted for the procedure to carried out under LA.
During the entire surgery the Dr. checked on me to ensure that there was no pain and that I was at ease throughout.
After the surgery all the post-surgical precautionary instructions and necessary prescriptions were given. 
I received messages/calls immediately the next day from the clinic inquiring about my well being.
The Doctor also called me for a follow up to check on how the healing and recovery was happening.
The reason I have been so descriptive is because of the extremely positive and professional experience that I have had throughout my treatment.
I would definitely recommend Dr. Shetty and Dazzle Dental and i am happy to have a dentist who really cares and ensures that dental treatment is not all that scary that it seems to be.
Keep up the amazing work Dazzle Dental!
