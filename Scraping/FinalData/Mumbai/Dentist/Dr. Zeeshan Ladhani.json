Great ambiance, fresh, pleasant aroma, extremely clean and tidy space. \n\nZeeshan is extremely friendly, warm, a good listener, is patient, methodical, ************* *** polite. He takes a keen interest in his patients, he is engaged in conversation, spends time patiently listening and answering any and all questions or concerns and making sure you are thoroughly satisfied. He has an honest and sincere approach and is not one to rush anything or do a half-hearted job. Can definitely whole heartedly be trusted! \nAdditionally, Zeeshan is highly responsive, him and his team are in sync and they are punctual with appointments with no wait time.\n\nLoved the doc\u2019s choice of music and visuals on the television too!\n\nOverall the service was top notch, highly recommend for any dental concerns and I believe in supporting establishments that are evidently putting their best foot forward and getting it right!",

Great ambiance, fresh, pleasant aroma, extremely clean and tidy space. \n\nZeeshan is extremely friendly, warm, a good listener, is patient, methodical, ************* *** polite. He takes a keen interest in his patients, he is engaged in conversation, spends time patiently listening and answering any and all questions or concerns and making sure you are thoroughly satisfied. He has an honest and sincere approach and is not one to rush anything or do a half-hearted job. Can definitely whole heartedly be trusted! \nAdditionally, Zeeshan is highly responsive, him and his team are in sync and they are punctual with appointments with no wait time.\n\nLoved the doc\u2019s choice of music and visuals on the television too!\n\nOverall the service was top notch, highly recommend for any dental concerns and I believe in supporting establishments that are evidently putting their best foot forward and getting it right!",
