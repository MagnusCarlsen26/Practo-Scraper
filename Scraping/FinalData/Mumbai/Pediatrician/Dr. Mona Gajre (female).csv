We have been seeing Dr Gajre since November last year as our nine-year old son faced some difficulties in academics due to his short attention span. His school had suggested her name. She has been quite accurate and effective in her diagonasis , assessment and her treatment plans. In her, we found a sympathetic person, too, as she has always been gentle, patient and open to our suggestions and observations concerning the treatment and progress of our son. Results of her compassionate approach and professional competence and brilliance are evident in remarkable improvements in our son. We are extremely grateful to her.
