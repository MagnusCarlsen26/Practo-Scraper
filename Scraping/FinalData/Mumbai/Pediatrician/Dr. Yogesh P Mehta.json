He is gentle and polite , gives us time to explain the health issue and answers to all our illness related queries without a rush.\n2. He is easily approachable and it is easy to book a suitable appointment slot.\n3. He does not readily prescribe medicines/antibiotics for simple issues. \n4. He is just a call away as he shares\n his cellphone number in case of an urgency.\n  He encourages parents to update him with their \n kids' recovery ,especially in times of fever.\n5. MY personal experience with Dr.Mehta \n   lately :\nMy son ,now 11 had dengue on Oct 4, for which I approached Dr.Mehta on the first day of fever.He not only diagnosed the disease early on but suggested a special diet chart for him that kept my son's fluid intake optimum and spared us from the pain of hospitalisation .\nSince my son was weak ,I could share my son's recovery process with him over the phone ,without visiting him every day, as he had shared his mobile number with us.\nI have great faith in Dr.Yogesh P Mehta and would recommend all parents to consult him for their kids' health issues. It will make the tough times during their kids' illness sail smooth and hassle free. \n\n\n\n",

Doctor with smile face whatever their personal problems are in their mind.\n4.friendliness to parents and children *** ** ****** **** ********* without experimenting on child by offering many medicines on trial basis.\n6.instant appointment giving and no waiting... this makes me very comfortable as I am very busy in my schedule ... Dr Mehta is always conveniently accommodates whenever called for appointment with very short notice.\n\nAll the above qualities are perfectly matching with Dr Yogesh Mehta from Dr. L H Hiranandani Hospital powai...\nAny parents who wants the doctor with above qualities will not say no to this doctor....  I truly respect Dr Mehta.... so far he is not doctor to my 2nd son since he was born but also for my 1st son who is 8 years old and he has become our family doctor now.....  \nDr Mehta exceptional quality is that he is well aware of All the issues of new born child or matured  children during diagnosis time in advance so he comes to treatment solution without experimenting...\nI strongly recommend Dr Yogesh Mehta to parents for their new born or for delivery or for children of any age and even for parents..... tell.me ,who does not want \"all facility under single umbrella\" which Dr Mehta perfectly offers....\nDon't hesitate to write to me or call me to kmow more about Dr Mehta who is such a great experienced doctor who are rarely seen....  most importantly the money comes secondary to him... In fact I have been after him to pay for  fees many a times  at the fee counter to remind him..... so gentle and warm and smily faced rare doctor...  look at the doctor with smile which throws away 50% patients disease because as a parent u get that confidence and comfortness  to talk to him.   \nI finish this with this shirt note as nothing is adequate to describe him  in few lines......\nParents.... Please try him out this outstanding doctor who stands out from the crowd in providing good treatment and he is tech savvy and mobile and WhatsApp friendly..... what more u want in these Internet of things (IOT) days....\nGood day.....

We were as nervous and anxious as any of the first time parents are, however, he immediately put us at ease and gave us precise instructions as to how to go about nursing the baby. From then till now (my daughter is almost 3.5 years), he has been the Pediatrician to my child. The best part about the doctor is that he is available on phone whenever you need him- that in itself allays your fears (just in case an emergency arises). Also, he makes the child feel comfortable and makes Pediatrician visit a pleasant experience for them. \nWe had one such situation when my daughter was just five days old and her weight was reducing. She wasn't much active and so the doctor asked us to get her admitted if she doesn't show much activity. We did so, and immediately after getting her to the hospital she was her normal self within a couple of hours. Dr. Mehta kept her under observation for a day ( to ensure that the child is not dehydrating) and discharged her post that as it was just a case of normal weight loss. We were happy the way the doctor handled it and would recommend him to the parents of a newborn and parents who are in search of a good Pediatrician for their growing children. ",

This might seem simple but anyone with small children know that this is extremely tricky. Dr. Mehta would always be in touch with you for first 24 hours after the first visit and take thorough observations to finalize his diagnosis and then prescribe medications. This is rare in today's age when the default way is to start immediate antibiotics. Extremely trustworthy and reliable, a 10 minute visit would relieve a parent of several doubts and that's actually half the medicine. Recommend Dr. Mehta for small children, especially if your approach is to go with only essential medications/antibiotics. He is the one who recommended nutritional ways to help us develop our child's immunity. Basis his nutrition advice, we could ensure a huge benefit in terms of frequency of seasonal infections for our toddler. \n\nHis patience and polite demeanor is a cherry on the ice for a learned and experienced practitioner. \n\nIn summary, an experienced professional whom you can trust like a family member.

Dr. Yogesh Mehta is a very good communicator, looks you in the eye, explains information in layman\u2019s terms, answers your questions, is patient with you and your child, and respects you as the child\u2019s parent. ** ***** **** **** **** ***** **** *** **** ********* *** **** **** ***** **** ******* **** he takes timely progress by calling you personally and will give you further advise which is very rare quality in any doctor (because of their busy schedule).

He is gentle and polite , gives us time to explain the health issue and answers to all our illness related queries without a rush.\n2. He is easily approachable and it is easy to book a suitable appointment slot.\n3. He does not readily prescribe medicines/antibiotics for simple issues. \n4. He is just a call away as he shares\n his cellphone number in case of an urgency.\n  He encourages parents to update him with their \n kids' recovery ,especially in times of fever.\n5. MY personal experience with Dr.Mehta \n   lately :\nMy son ,now 11 had dengue on Oct 4, for which I approached Dr.Mehta on the first day of fever.He not only diagnosed the disease early on but suggested a special diet chart for him that kept my son's fluid intake optimum and spared us from the pain of hospitalisation .\nSince my son was weak ,I could share my son's recovery process with him over the phone ,without visiting him every day, as he had shared his mobile number with us.\nI have great faith in Dr.Yogesh P Mehta and would recommend all parents to consult him for their kids' health issues. It will make the tough times during their kids' illness sail smooth and hassle free. \n\n\n\n",

Doctor with smile face whatever their personal problems are in their mind.\n4.friendliness to parents and children *** ** ****** **** ********* without experimenting on child by offering many medicines on trial basis.\n6.instant appointment giving and no waiting... this makes me very comfortable as I am very busy in my schedule ... Dr Mehta is always conveniently accommodates whenever called for appointment with very short notice.\n\nAll the above qualities are perfectly matching with Dr Yogesh Mehta from Dr. L H Hiranandani Hospital powai...\nAny parents who wants the doctor with above qualities will not say no to this doctor....  I truly respect Dr Mehta.... so far he is not doctor to my 2nd son since he was born but also for my 1st son who is 8 years old and he has become our family doctor now.....  \nDr Mehta exceptional quality is that he is well aware of All the issues of new born child or matured  children during diagnosis time in advance so he comes to treatment solution without experimenting...\nI strongly recommend Dr Yogesh Mehta to parents for their new born or for delivery or for children of any age and even for parents..... tell.me ,who does not want \"all facility under single umbrella\" which Dr Mehta perfectly offers....\nDon't hesitate to write to me or call me to kmow more about Dr Mehta who is such a great experienced doctor who are rarely seen....  most importantly the money comes secondary to him... In fact I have been after him to pay for  fees many a times  at the fee counter to remind him..... so gentle and warm and smily faced rare doctor...  look at the doctor with smile which throws away 50% patients disease because as a parent u get that confidence and comfortness  to talk to him.   \nI finish this with this shirt note as nothing is adequate to describe him  in few lines......\nParents.... Please try him out this outstanding doctor who stands out from the crowd in providing good treatment and he is tech savvy and mobile and WhatsApp friendly..... what more u want in these Internet of things (IOT) days....\nGood day.....

We were as nervous and anxious as any of the first time parents are, however, he immediately put us at ease and gave us precise instructions as to how to go about nursing the baby. From then till now (my daughter is almost 3.5 years), he has been the Pediatrician to my child. The best part about the doctor is that he is available on phone whenever you need him- that in itself allays your fears (just in case an emergency arises). Also, he makes the child feel comfortable and makes Pediatrician visit a pleasant experience for them. \nWe had one such situation when my daughter was just five days old and her weight was reducing. She wasn't much active and so the doctor asked us to get her admitted if she doesn't show much activity. We did so, and immediately after getting her to the hospital she was her normal self within a couple of hours. Dr. Mehta kept her under observation for a day ( to ensure that the child is not dehydrating) and discharged her post that as it was just a case of normal weight loss. We were happy the way the doctor handled it and would recommend him to the parents of a newborn and parents who are in search of a good Pediatrician for their growing children. ",

This might seem simple but anyone with small children know that this is extremely tricky. Dr. Mehta would always be in touch with you for first 24 hours after the first visit and take thorough observations to finalize his diagnosis and then prescribe medications. This is rare in today's age when the default way is to start immediate antibiotics. Extremely trustworthy and reliable, a 10 minute visit would relieve a parent of several doubts and that's actually half the medicine. Recommend Dr. Mehta for small children, especially if your approach is to go with only essential medications/antibiotics. He is the one who recommended nutritional ways to help us develop our child's immunity. Basis his nutrition advice, we could ensure a huge benefit in terms of frequency of seasonal infections for our toddler. \n\nHis patience and polite demeanor is a cherry on the ice for a learned and experienced practitioner. \n\nIn summary, an experienced professional whom you can trust like a family member.

Frankly I didn't know anything about Dr Mehta, but now I can say that when you have Dr. Yogesh Mehta as your pediatrician than you are rest assured that you have right doctor for your kid who is always a phone call away. You want to feel comfortable asking questions, discussing diagnoses and treatments, and partnering with your Child's  pediatrician in your child\u2019s care. There is a lot to learn about your child\u2019s health and being able to understand what your doctor explains to you is an important part of child's health. Dr. Yogesh Mehta is a very good communicator, looks you in the eye, explains information in layman\u2019s terms, answers your questions, is patient with you and your child, and respects you as the child\u2019s parent. ** ***** **** **** **** ***** **** *** **** ********* *** **** **** ***** **** ******* **** he takes timely progress by calling you personally and will give you further advise which is very rare quality in any doctor (because of their busy schedule). I will definitely recommend Dr. Yogesh Mehta to every mother for their kids. ",

He is the first doctor who I have come across that mentioned he is available 24/7 and that I could call him or message anytime if any concerns with my child health. This fact in itself is very comforting for any parent. He also took my number and he personally checked with me about my daughter\u2019s health after two days. He is really good and is very genuine.

He consulted through video call and prescribed medicines. Most importantly he gave a briefing about what to expect in the coming days. He even adjusted the antibiotic as per our request as my son did not like the taste of the liquid. The next day Dr called up to enquire about the status and was very  comforting. *** ********* *** **** ********* *** *** fever started coming down the same day.  We were able to brief him about his health everyday for a week till he completely recovered. Dr. Mehta is an excellent choice. I am looking forward to consult him on boosting the immunity of my kid in the future. ",

Then a friend suggested us to visit Dr Yogesh Mehta and since then I am worry free about the health of our daughter. Once my daughter feel ill at the age of 8 months, she  was running a high fever. It was a Sunday, I panickly called Dr Mehta and he immediately asked us to visit the hospital. Even on a Sunday at 5 in in the evening he cancelled his personal appointment of a family function and attended to our daughter till 9 pm. Since then I have very high regards for him.Dr Mehta is very friendly and will listen to us patiently. There have been times when I have called him at 11 in the night for consultation and he has been kind enough to listen to us and provide solution. Our daughter is now 2.2 years old and I will continue to consult Dr Mehta for my daughter's health.",

He spends a lot of time explaining the issue and he also tells you clearly about the medicines to be taken and precautions that need to be taken at home. He is also always available on the phone for follow up consultations or for emergencies. The time and care that he devotes to each patient (and assuaging their parents fears!) is truly remarkable. We cannot thank him enough for his help over the past year and a half. Strongly recommended!",

Throughout my stay at hospital, he answered all my queries patiently. He did regular rounds and was always available when required. He was quite vigilant and attentive as well as very sincere, committed and approachable. He was quite concerned as well for the well being of our child. As parents it not only makes us calm but also injects confidence. Had a really good experience and would highly recommend his name if anyone wants to visit Hiranandani hospital for their child.",

What we really like about the Dr is his down to earth attitude, keen listening skills, conservative yet practical approach to treatments and his accessibility.
