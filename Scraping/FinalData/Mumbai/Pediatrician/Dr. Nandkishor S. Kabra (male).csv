I would have consulted atleast 100 doctors of all top notch hospitals till date in Mumbai and around the country, But yet to come accross a doctor of his calibre in the field of Neonatology.
Yet to come accross a doctor with his levels of Patience and Empathy while dealing with Parents and so nice even when treating the support staff and nurses working with him.
God sent angel who has the ability of showing you hope and gives courage even in your darkest hours.
