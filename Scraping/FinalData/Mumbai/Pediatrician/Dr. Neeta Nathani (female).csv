During her last visit to clinic, Dr. Nathani told my daughter a very nice story about how the kitten toy in her clinic wanted a bottle to drink milk as kitten's mom was not with her and she was all alone.. so Dr. Nathani asked my daughter if she will help her and then my daughter agreed to give away the bottle to the kitten..that's it!!
