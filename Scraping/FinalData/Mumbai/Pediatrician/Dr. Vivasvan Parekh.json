The doc said that he would prefer giving antibiotics only if it was the last resort after he tried every thing else  .. we visited his new clinic near Deonar which was very nice and well equipped.. he is a very good doctor and I would recommend him to my friends who have babies also ",

Even after informing them its illegal, they were least bothered and told me to take this matter up with whomsoever I want. This forced me to look for ATM where I could use my card to withdraw the funds and pay. Unfortunately, in couple of nearby ATMs, the card didn't work and cash wasn't there, I had to walk for atleast 15-20 mins (one way) to withdraw the cash.",

The doc said that he would prefer giving antibiotics only if it was the last resort after he tried every thing else  .. we visited his new clinic near Deonar which was very nice and well equipped.. he is a very good doctor and I would recommend him to my friends who have babies also ",

Dr.Vivasvan Parekh and his team are highly efficient and they handled the baby with great expertise. The baby recuperated very well and is now normal.

Even after informing them its illegal, they were least bothered and told me to take this matter up with whomsoever I want. This forced me to look for ATM where I could use my card to withdraw the funds and pay. Unfortunately, in couple of nearby ATMs, the card didn't work and cash wasn't there, I had to walk for atleast 15-20 mins (one way) to withdraw the cash.",

Best part he explains to you a friend a family member and not the way as a routine doctor would do. Any emergency patient he takes the consent from the current under diagnosis patient, explains the criticality and attends the critical patient. Doesn't difference rich or poor patient based on critical issues he attends. Also,  is very humble n caring towards his staff, never seen him shouting on other patients.. Cool doctor. You can blindly trust him and leave the patient in his care to recover and be happy on their feet again... Godfrey D'silva ",
