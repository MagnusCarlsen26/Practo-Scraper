Firstly the doctor said that they don\u2019t accept Cashless and that I will need to get it reimbursed from practo. Also the plaster that he applied seemed a bit inflated cost wise. Earlier I was not being given a bill and was quoted 4400/- and when I insisted for a bill they hiked it to 4800/- with no break up of costs of plaster material. The date was also marked incorrectly on the bill whereas it was correct on the prescription. These kinds of issues (might be harmless) however draw suspicion.",

Firstly the doctor said that they don\u2019t accept Cashless and that I will need to get it reimbursed from practo. Also the plaster that he applied seemed a bit inflated cost wise. Earlier I was not being given a bill and was quoted 4400/- and when I insisted for a bill they hiked it to 4800/- with no break up of costs of plaster material. The date was also marked incorrectly on the bill whereas it was correct on the prescription. These kinds of issues (might be harmless) however draw suspicion.",
