"Doctor friendliness,Explanation of the health issue,","Knee Replacement,",0,0,NO,"My knee replacement surgery was done by Dr Nilen Shah, i was admitted at Cumbala hill hospital.however neither he nor any of his fellows came to see me either before or after the surgery. I had tons of questions to ask about post surgery recovery. After my repeated requests, the hospital staff conveyed it to the doctor, and only then almost 24 hrs later ,just an hour before my discharge,one of his assistant fellow came to visit. This according to me was most unprofessional
Even today, a month post surgery, i have no access to the Doctor on phone if i have a problem...i ve to contact his assistant and make do with his ""expert"" opinion.
That's my only reason for not recommending the doctor, as I feel , that only the doctor's reassurance and personal guidance can make you feel relieved and comfortable post Surgery ",2022-04-23 20:55:11,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
