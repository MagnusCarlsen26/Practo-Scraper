,,0,0,YES,"Excellent operation performed by Dr. Girish Bhalerao who is a knee specialist. He is an expert/ specialist of injury that happens due to sports.
I had a knee injury and couldn’t bent my left leg, I consulted few orthopedic doctors but could not get better or got convinced of getting operated until I met Dr. Girish Bhalerao.
After the consultation the dr. explained me every detail of what had happened to my leg and what surgery would I require to get back to my original strength. He is so confident with his work that I wanted to get operated immediately.
I was so confident in the doctor because he uses every possible means to take out the fear of a patient and directs you to the truth and gives you correct informations. He uses 3D structures, 3D videos and videos of actual operation to explain everything. And behaves very calmly and joyful in situations.
On the day of operation I was guided and explained everything nicely. It was the best hospital visits ever in my life because it didn’t had anything to fear.
Along with it the staff was so cooperative and generous. They helped and did their duties wholeheartedly and by staying grounded.",2021-10-27 08:22:43,False,True,Arun Gaud,,,
