I went for an x-ray at Lion Tarachand Bapa Hospital, Sion and the injury was diagnosed as fracture. I have been under Dr. Om Patil's treatment since then and have found him to be an expert and quite knowledgeable in the orthopaedic field. He diagnosed my injury correctly and has treated me well. It's been over 2 months and my fracture has healed completely. I am able to walk without any support or difficulty and am on the road to a complete recovery thanks to Dr. Om Patil.",
