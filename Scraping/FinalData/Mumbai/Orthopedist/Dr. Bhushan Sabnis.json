One amazing quality he has is he would maintain complete transparency with his patients. His confidence to resolve a complex case like mine gave me a relief that I'm in safe hands. It seems its his passion to take n resolve complex cases with ease. He's always there to answer your queries and gives you satisfactory explanation unless you're convinced. I remember right from my first meet till date of my post operative visits, one thing he has constantly asked me \"ask?\" (this brings smile on my face) which means he not only understands that I had a query but also ready to answer the same n explain me well. This is the best I have ever seen in any doctor. He's completely approachable and always boosted my confidence pre-post surgery. He's truly a gem and god's messenger gifted to us in this era to our nation.  Stay blessed doctor. Lods of Love and Thanks for being there. ",

He is one of the best orthopedic surgeon I ever came across. No matter how complex your case is he will come up with the best solution and will make sure you get cured. Dr. Bhushan Sabnis is such a humble human being, he will give ample amount of time to his patients and will make sure they have no doubts in his/her mind (ideally very few people do this). Recently, I went through one complex knee surgery which was excellently performed by Dr. Bhushan Sabnis and his team. I am just grateful to God that I came across such wonderful and intellectual Doctor. I am just short of words to express my gratitude towards Dr. Bhushan Sabnis. Hats off to his work! and Hats off to his team! Thank you so much Dr. Bhushan Sabnis for all your efforts and guidance.",
