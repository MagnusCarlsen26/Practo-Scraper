"Doctor friendliness,Wait time,","Joint and Muscle Problems,",0,0,NO,It was very bad experience. They have booking of 4 patients of same time including me that is 8.30pm.

I though the doctor was gossip with one person in his cabin more than half hour. After some complaint from the doctor came rudely answer. After that he handles all pending patient with 2-3 minute each.It was very horrible experience and expect this type of behavior and management from such qualified doctor. ,2020-01-22 07:34:32,False,False,Verified Patient,,,
